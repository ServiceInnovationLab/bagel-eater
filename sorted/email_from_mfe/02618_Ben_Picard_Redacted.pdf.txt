While the Dutch import CO2 generators for their glasshouses to promote plant growth, it is an indication of the

essential function of it. Yet in spite of that it is ignored and we are in New Zealand forced to swallow it and accept
that it is a pollutant. We strongly object to a destructive economic decision which will bring about widespread
poverty and ruin most businesses since this is a shortsighted position to adopt. Desist and stop this before it is too

late.
