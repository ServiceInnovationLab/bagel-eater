Dear Minister, I support the passing of a Zero Carbon Act, which should set a goal of reducing total greenhouse

gases to net zero by 2050, in order to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. To achieve that goal, greenhouse
gas emissions must be cut rapidly and soon, with most reductions made over the next decade. Market-based
initiatives like the Emissions Trading Scheme have proven ineffectual. Legislation is needed, and it should also
include a plan for adaptation to ease the transition. All greenhouse gases from all sectors should be covered by the

law, consistent with international climate frameworks. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change, methane reduction is critical to success in tackling climate change. It is not acceptable for New Zealand to
excuse its agricultural sector from compliance; methane emissions must be reduced to sustainable levels to help
meet the net-zero target. Furthermore, the reductions should be achieved by actual cuts in our own emissions, not
by purchasing overseas carbon credits or relying on forests as carbon sinks An independent Climate Commission

should be established to set emissions budgets and monitor progress. The Climate Commission should have
statutory power, not merely serve as an advisory group. Climate budgets should be legally binding and set
minimum targets to be achieved within prescribed timeframes. New Zealand has a comparative advantage and
should be a leader in managing climate change. Yours sincerely, Helen Goile
