Subject: Zero Carbon Bill
I wish to register my opposition to the Zero Carbon Bill proposed by James Shaw.

There is no real-life evidence that man-made global warming exists and weather events that we are experiencing today have
been experienced many times in the past.


Carbon dioxide is essential for life on earth as plants need it to release oxygen for us to breathe.

We have seen so many climate models that have been proven to be inaccurate - such as the models used by former US Vice

President Al Gore and the UN Environmental Programme to claim that sea level rise would engulf cities around the world and
create 50 million climate refugees by 2010!

We are a little country at the bottom of the world with a minute population. There are at least 56 cities the world with a

population greater than the population of the whole of the country  of New Zealand. What New Zealand does is not going to
change the climate.

But what the government is proposing will detrimentally affect every New Zealander economically.


No party has the right to introduce policies to destroy a countryâ€™s economic future without clearly spelling out their intentions
during an election campaign.

I say no to any emissions target.
