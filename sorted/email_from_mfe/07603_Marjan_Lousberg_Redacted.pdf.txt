Dear Minister, I support the passing of legally binding climate law. The law must be fair, ambitious and consistent

with the climate science and international frameworks by including all gases and all sectors. There must be rapid
cuts in all greenhouse gases beginning now. I support a net-zero target of 2040 with the majority of cuts occurring
over the next decade. I support all greenhouse gases being included in the law, consistent with international
climate frameworks. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change makes it clear that methane reduction is

critical to success in tackling climate change. It is politically and scientifically untenable for New Zealand’s climate
law to exclude any gases from our biggest emitting sector - the agricultural sector. I support the establishment of a
Climate Commission, whose role should be to devise binding budgets. The Climate Commission should have
statutory teeth, and not just an advisory group that governments could ignore. Climate budgets should be legally
binding and set a bare-minimum target, which must be achieved or bettered by government within the prescribed

timeframes. While budgets should be binding, policy recommendations from the Commission should be just that -
recommendations. I support the ‘firewall’ principle, that New Zealand’s targets must be achieved by actual cuts in
our own emissions, and not through the purchase of overseas carbon credits or an over-reliance on forests as
carbon sinks The science is clear: the only way we can succeed is with big ambition. New Zealand must be bold and
pass strong law for the sake of our precious earth and future generations. Yours sincerely, Marjan Lousberg
