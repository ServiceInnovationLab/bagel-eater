Dear Madam / Sir

                        Submission on the Zero Carbon Bill from Alis Graham-Russell

This is our chance. I'm excited to be submitting on the Zero Carbon Bill because I do not agree with a net zero
target. It is an unrealistic / unachievable goal. So would place an unnecessary burden on people as the

governments idea of "fixing" thing is just to tax it.

2050 target

Q1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation? (In legislation

now, or later via the Climate Commission?)

The Zero Carbon Act needs to be scrapped

Q2. Which is the best 2050 target for New Zealand? (Which emissions should be covered and how?)


We cannot met a net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases. Sensible reduction should be legislated for.


Q3. How should New Zealand meet its targets? (Within New Zealand, or with international trading too?)


By cutting emissions here (including by planting more forests) in New Zealand, It is absolutely crazy concept to be
buying overseas credits. Buying credits to allow emissions does NOT stop them being created in the first place.


Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

It should NOT exist in the first place.

Emissions budgets


Q5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each ( covering the next 15 years) be in
place at any given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

NO. Emissions budgets under the Zero Carbon Act are a load of BS


Q6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget ( furthest into the future)?

See above.


Q7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific
range under exceptional circumstances?

See above.


Q8. Do you agree with the proposed considerations that the Government and the Climate Commission will need to
take into account when advising on and setting budgets?

The climate commission ????? Another load of BS

We ALL need to consider:
- scientific knowledge/ / propaganda? regarding climate change
- technology relevant to climate change
- social circumstances
- energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy supplies and the carbon and energy intensity of the

economy
- economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision
- fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on taxation, public spending and public borrowing

Government response


Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the
emissions budgets?

Don't agree that Zero is realistic - there are more achievable options - that we should plan for.


Q10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For
example, who do we need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
In setting plans to meet a country wide AGREED emissions budget, the government should be:
- making sure they're based on the best science available
- ensuring that they deliver fair outcomes for Kiwis

- honouring Te Tiriti o Waitangi
- being environmentally sustainable,
- maximising the impact of money spent and being cost-effective
- encouraging innovation

- unlocking economic opportunities for New Zealanders, such as in renewable energy
- consulting people who will be economically affected, like farmers or businesses, tangata whenua
- consulting communities already facing the physical impacts of climate change

Climate Change Commission


Q11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's
progress towards its goals. Do you agree with these functions?

The Commission should provide expert independent advice, but it should not be the only place from where advice is

sought. It should not be the decision maker.

Q12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)? (Should it provide advice, or make decisions too?)


The Commission should be one of any number of bodies that the New Zealand Government seeks advice from

Q13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and
desirable expertise. Do you agree with the proposed expertise?


I agree that members of the Climate Commission should have expertise in:

- climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
- climate change policy

- te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori (Māori language, culture, and philosophy) and Māori interests
- knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology development system
- risk management
- resource economics and impacts (including labour markets and distribution)
- experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning, insurance and local government

- engineering and/or infrastructure
- community engagement and communications
- business competitiveness

In addition, they should have expertise in:

- expertise in public health
- understanding of our international commitments,
- understanding of the social impacts of climate change and government policy

Adapting to the impact of climate change


Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Yes.


Q15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree
with the proposed functions?

The Zero Carbon Act should NOT be Zero! But consideration of the following is needed

- a national adaptation plan
- regular reviews of progress towards implementing the national adaptation plan
- an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some

organisations share information on their exposure to climate change risks?

Yet more groups that require a lot of money to set up that aren't really needed.

An extra point to consider - climate finance


We need to take responsibility for what we do. It is not up to New Zealand to tell others what to do or pay for what
other choose to do or not do.


Conclusion

I think a huge political machine is being built around climate change. Yes we do need to seriously look at what we
are doing and to do better where we can. I think there has to be transparent processes in place to better deal with
climate concerns. I don't think the Zero emissions concept is sensible, or practical.

Yours faithfully
Alis Graham-Russell
