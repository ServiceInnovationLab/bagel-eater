Dear Sir/Madam,
I am not prepared to accept the economic consequences of this ill-advised piece of legislation which stands to take New Zealand in an
economic downward spiral. New Zealand, as an already insignificant contributor to carbon emissions should do the bare minimum

rather than put our already struggling economy in jeopardy.
The government needs to front up and present the facts to the people who will suffer if this piece of work goes through i.e. all New
Zealanders.

What we need:
   1. Proof that these measures are necessary.
   2. For the benefits to be quantified.

   3. The cost by way of economic consequences of these measures to be explained.
   4. The cost of the bureaucracy required to administer these measures to be revealed.
This issue needs to be put before all New Zealanders in a very obvious and transparent way with robust televised discussion involving

proponents, detractors and relevant experts representing both sides of the climate-change argument. I would hate to see this rushed
through without widespread consultation and disclosure.
Hopefully, common sense will prevail and this legislation wonâ€™t proceed at all!

Yours sincerely,
Greg Young
