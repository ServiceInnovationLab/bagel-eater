I am a retired psychotherapist and grandmother of 6. I am aware of childrenâ€™s vulnerability and deeply concerned for their

future health and wellbeing. I know our young boys and girls are inheriting the environmental mistakes mine and previous
generations have perpetrated on the earth.
Therefore I support the proposed Zero Carbon Act with the hope that present and all future governments will address the
damage caused by green house emissions both CO2 and methane. I hope they will set ambitious goals to reduce current

emissions and actively support councils around the country along with businesses and individuals to meet these goals.
We need strong, informed science-based and morally sound leadership to help us all find alternative ways to live. We need
future generations to be better informed about the disastrous consequences of choosing environmentally damaging
actions in the pursuit of progress.
