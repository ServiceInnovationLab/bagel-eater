Good morning.
I am appalled that you are still persisting in the clearly discredited concept that global warming is a result of human activity.
This has now been relabelled climate change because it has been proved that fluctuations in ambient temperature are a
naturally occurring phenomenon. It is also a fact that weather variations occur naturally and what we are experiencing is

within the normal range of weather patterns.
The Greens have it wrong. The PM has it wrong and is merely going along with the hysteria to be seen to follow the
international scam and financial destruction of national economies.
Do not persist with this folly. The NZ economy is dependent on farming. This has been shown to be a carbon neutral activity,
despite your assertions.

We cannot abandon fossil fuels as the alternative is too costly, and impractical to implement.
James Shaw is wrong and totally deceptive in his portrayal of his vision, or nightmare if you prefer.
Stop now before it is too late and the next generation is so impoverished that living becomes unattractive. We dont need
another 1930â€™s depression.
