Dear minister. Tackling climate change is a matter of life and death for all life on this planet. Are we going to stand

up and be counted as we did with the nuclear free policy or are we going to give up? Ps. Climate change is just the
visible tip of the iceberg, if we are to do anything we have to stop treating the only planet we have as a rubbish
dump. Yours sincerely, Philip Brown
