Dear Sir or Madam,

Thank you for the opportunity to have a say on the proposed Zero Carbon Bill. I am writing in support of vulnerable communities in the Pacific.

I believe we have a responsibility to support these communities to adapt to their changing climate. As such, I ask that the Zero Carbon Bill become a tool
to strengthen our climate assistance to the Pacific. Specifically, I encourage you to:
   1.  Include strong language in the Bill on our commitments to developing countries, as per Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals,

      particularly in the area of adaptation;
   2.  Set up a process, as part of the proposed Climate Change Commission, to ensure greater transparency and impact of our current and future
      climate finance to developing countries.‚Äù

Kind regards,

Kylie Enoka
