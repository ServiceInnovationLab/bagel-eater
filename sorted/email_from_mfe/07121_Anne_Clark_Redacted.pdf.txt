Dear Minister, Re the new legislation for the Zero Carbon Act to help reduce New Zealand/s greenhouse gas

emissions, I fully support the passing of legally binding climate law. We really do need to take advantage of this. It
is a very real opportunity to create strong climate action into this country's law. There is a very real risk that the
law could be weakened by vested interested, eg the dairy industry as they want exemptions for emissions. I believe
Climate Change is our greatest challenge ever and we cannot afford to have that curbed by selfish industries. We

recently inspired the world when we banned new off-short oil exploration. We may be a small country but we have a
history of standing together to make things happen. Let us join forces once more to ensure the Zero Carbon
Emission Law becomes reality. Yours sincerely, Anne Clark
