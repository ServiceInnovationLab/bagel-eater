Dear Minister, I support the passing of the Zero Carbon Act as a legally binding law. I support all greenhouse gases

being included in the law. I support the establishment of a Climate Commission, whose role should be to devise
binding budgets. I support the ‘firewall’ principle, that New Zealand’s targets must be achieved by actual cuts in
our own emissions, and not through the purchase of overseas carbon credits. While consensus across political
parties is good, any cross-party agreement should not be achieved at the cost of strong climate law. New Zealand

must be bold and pass strong law for the sake of our precious earth and future generations. Yours sincerely,
Angela Coleman
