Dear Ministry for the Environment,


I believe in a net-zero carbon future for New Zealand. We need to make dramatic reductions in our emissions to
keep climate change limited to 1.5 degrees and ensure our precious native plants and animals are protected.
Nature is our taonga and we cannot exist without it. We must act together.


The key things I support in a Zero Carbon Act are:

    target for net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 should be in the Act.
    The emissions from transport, industrial activity, agriculture, and all other sources should be included in the
    target. Even ‘short-lived’ gasses can have a huge effect on our climate and need to be reduced.

    Emissions budgets should be at least as important as fiscal budgets, and the Government should set plans to
    achieve them.
    An independent Climate Change Commission of experts should monitor emissions and give advice to keep New
    Zealand on-track for its emissions reduction goals.

Is there anything you'd like to add?
Climate change is impacting NZ now, we need to act swiftly and immediately. We no longer have the luxury of time if

we want to avoid catastrophic impacts not only to our biodiversity but also to our way of life. Our economy will
suffer if we do not address environmental concerns - e.g. our 100% Pure that tourism relies on can not be upheld
with our degraded waterways, communities living on our coastlines are already suffering extreme weather events
and will likely need to retreat as insurance becomes un-affordable or unavailable.


Please ask the Ministry for the Environment to withhold my name and personal details from public
