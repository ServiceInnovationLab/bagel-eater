Subject: Zero Carbon Bill
To Whom it may Concern,
I am strongly opposed to the Labour and Greens Zero Carbon Bill in all forms. I am not prepared to accept the drastic

economic consequences of their Zero Carbon Bill which Climate Change Minister James Shaw is dishonestly down-playing the
costs and claiming benefits when their are none. The burden will fall disproportionately on the poor , lower income households
and farming intensive industries which are the backbone of our economy.

It is an unproven theory with no real- life evidence that dangerous man-made global warming exists. To attack Carbon Dioxide
is untenable as it remains essential for life on earth. Carbon Dioxide causes Global Warming like Wet Roads cause Rain.
The Zero Carbon Bill should be rejected in the strongest possible way and withdrawn.
