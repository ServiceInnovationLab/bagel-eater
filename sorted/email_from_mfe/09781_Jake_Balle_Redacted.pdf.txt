To whom it may concern,


My submission is that I want New Zealand to take no part in the foolhardy, duplicit and treacherous scam that is "Zero
Carbon".


I would list all the reason's why if I thought it would make one iota of difference but I know it won't. We know the decision has
already been made.

Regards,


Jake Balle
