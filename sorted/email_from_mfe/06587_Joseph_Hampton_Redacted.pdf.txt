Dear Minister, I support the passing of legally binding climate law. The law must be fair, ambitious and consistent -

but focus first on gases that do not affect our primary agricultural exports. The architecture and design community
and the building industry are capable of reacting to increased building code requirements (greater insulation, air
tightness, and mandated certification through greenstar, passivehaus or Living building challenge tools)
normalising higher building standards and low carbon, energy efficient design will mean houses and buildings

being constructed now will not become a carbon burden in the near future. New Zealand has the unique
opportunity to be global leaders in this space. The legislation should establish the goal of limiting warming to 1.5
degrees. We should not settle for 2 degrees warming. I support a net-zero target of 2040 with the majority of cuts
occurring over the next decade. I support the establishment of a Climate Commission, whose role should be to
devise binding budgets. The Climate Commission should have statutory teeth. I support the ‘firewall’ principle, that

New Zealand’s targets must be achieved by actual cuts in our own emissions and local forestry. Not through the
purchase of overseas credits. Cross-party political agreement should not prevent strong climate law. It would be
wrong to have broad agreement on weak law. The science is clear: the only way we can succeed is with big
ambition. New Zealand must be bold and pass strong law for the sake of our planet, our country and future
generations. Yours sincerely, Joseph Hampton
