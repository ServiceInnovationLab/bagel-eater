Dear Minister, I support the passing of legally binding climate law, consistent with climate science. Legislation

should establish the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees, to avoid severe damage to Pacific Island states. Cuts
in all greenhouse gases need to start now with a net-zero target of 2040 - with the majority of cuts occurring over
the next decade. Consistent with international climate frameworks, all greenhouse gases, including those from the
agriculture sector, need to be included in the law. I also support the establishment of a Climate Commission - rather

than an advisory group - whose role would include devising binding budgets - but whose advice would be limited to
recommendations. New Zealandâ€™s targets must be achieved by actual cuts in our own emissions, and not through
the purchase of overseas carbon credits or over-reliance on forests as carbon sinks Climate change is a huge
threat for humanity, and strong law is needed - for the sake of our planet and future generations. Yours sincerely,
Susan Shone
