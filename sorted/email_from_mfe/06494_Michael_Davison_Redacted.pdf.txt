Dear Minister, Once upon a time, NZ led the world in all sorts of ways, and we now have the chance to do so again

by shifting to a zero-carbon economy. It may not do ourselves much good in terms of stopping sea-level rise and the
ruination of our crops and fauna, but it would allow us to stand tall in the world again and, who know, it may
influence others to do the same. Let's do this! Yours sincerely, Michael Davison
