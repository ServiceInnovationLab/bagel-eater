Hello whoever, There must be a requirement for solar panels on all new roofs facing north in suitable areas. There

must also be the requirement for all power companies to pay a fair price per kilowatt or attribute power gained
back the panel owners account, rather than going into the grid for next to nothing. Solar panels have been
subsidised in many parts of the world. Germany, for example, no longer has nuclear plants as a result of a big
subsidy on solar power. (55 Euro cents / kw, which really got things going). The 4 kilowatts on my roof save me

about 20% on power, which will pay off the panel installation in 7 years or less with static prices. (of course power
prices will not remain static so even more savings). I also drive an Electric Vehicle which I can charge up during the
day, and, if necessary, feed the power back into the house at night if there is an outage. An Electric Vehicle is also a
no brainer for town use. Cost for the power is translated at about 25 cents per litre and there is little car
maintenance. The extra power usage argument is total fearmongering by guess who. Solar panels can much more

than mitigate the extra use of electricity but there needs to be government support for the project. For a new roof
(new house) in a north facing sunny area solar is a no brainer offering about 15% return on average. If the price
was added to rates over 10 years, all would gain. (called "win win"). Stop burning coal. There is no need. Thank
you. Ben Yours sincerely, Ben Van Dyke
