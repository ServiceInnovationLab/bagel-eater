Dear Minister, I support the passing of legally binding climate law. There can really be no other way. Climate

change is a real threat to the future security of New Zealand and the world. We must take steps now to protect the
world that our children will inherit, not just for the sake of New Zealanders, but equally so for those less fortunate
than us. We portray a clean image to the rest of the world, but having moved here from the UK feel this is far from
the truth. We are a small nation, but with grand visions, and one such vision should be to be brave enough to take

the initiative in helping stem the catastrophic effects climate change poses. You did it with nuclear power, we
should do it again with climate change. The clock is ticking and it's getting very late. Yours sincerely, Laurence
Potter
