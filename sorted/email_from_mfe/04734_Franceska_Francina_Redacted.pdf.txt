Dear Minister, I support the passing of legally binding climate law. The law must be fair, ambitious and consistent

with the climate science and international frameworks by including all gases and all sectors. FOR ME THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING IS TO STOP THE GEO ENGINEERING ABOVE NZ. AS THAT IS CAUSING THE CLIMATE CHANGES
LIKE STORMS. FLOODS AND DROUGHTS Yours sincerely, Franceska Francina
