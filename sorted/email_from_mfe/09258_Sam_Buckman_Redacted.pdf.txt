Dear Minister, I support the passing of legally binding climate law which places the future livability of our planet

above relatively inconsequential economic concerns. Without bold, urgent intervention, climate change promises to
be one of the larger causes of death and suffering in the decades and centuries to come. You know better than I
the exact shape such intervention would take. But please, do not allow yourself to be swayed by shortsightedness
and callous indifference to future generations. Be a leader; make the decisions that need to be made to save lives,

livelihoods and the planet. Yours sincerely, Sam Buckman
