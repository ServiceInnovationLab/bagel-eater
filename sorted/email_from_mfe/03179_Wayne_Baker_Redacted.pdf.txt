Dear Minister, I support the passing of legally binding climate law. But the law that’s proposed is weak and

pathetic. We need a carbon negative economy by 2030. The fate of a liviable atmosphere for humans is
disappearing fast. Every industry should be included in a carbon negative economy. The only real way to curb
climate change is to get rid of overproduction and greed. We need a system change and an economy based on need
and sharing. Start stripping away capitalism and we’ll address climate change and inequality at the same time. No

more neoliberal consumption taxes disguised as helping the environment. Get some guts and tax the rich. Yours
sincerely, Wayne Baker
