Dear Minister, I do not support the passing of legally binding climate law. The law must be fair, ambitious and

consistent with the climate science and international frameworks by including all gases and all sectors. CO2 is near
an all-time low, and our planetary survival depends on plants, and plants thrive on carbon dioxide. Further, one
active volcano emits more carbon dioxide than humanity has done in the last six thousand years. I support the
establishment of a Climate Commission, whose role should be to devise binding budgets. The Climate Commission

should have statutory teeth, otherwise it is merely an advisory group that governments could ignore. Climate
budgets should be legally binding and set a bare-minimum ambition, which must be achieved or bettered by
government within the prescribed timeframes. While budgets should be binding, policy recommendations from the
Commission should be just that - recommendations. It would be wrong to have broad agreement on weak law, when
what is urgently needed to address the problem is strong law. Yours sincerely, David Bell
