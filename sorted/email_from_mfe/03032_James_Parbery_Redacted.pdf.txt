Dear panel,
having come from europe the emissions trading scheme was a nightmare which really produced no benefit
The carbon tax will in all probability be the same bureaucratic mess which will overburden businesses reduce jobs and productivity.
If the country is not fully employing people reduced taxes are paid which ends up with reduced goverment spending.

All the compliance puts a massive strain on businesses which eventually gets passed on the the consumer
Just look at all the schemes europe and the eu have put in place and most would agree a complete waste of time except for the
people who have justify their extravagant wages and actually contribute nothing towards the economy
I could go on about the different pros and cons but enough said the scheme shouldnt go ahead
james
