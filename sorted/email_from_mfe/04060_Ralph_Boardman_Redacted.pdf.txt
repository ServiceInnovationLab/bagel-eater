Dear Hon Minister, I support the passing of legally binding climate law. The law must be fair, ambitious and

consistent with the climate science and international frameworks by including all gases and all sectors. It would be
a mistake to concentrate solely on emissions, since it is the NET effect of our human activity that matters, so
sequestration of carbon in particular must make a contribution. There is almost unlimited potential for advanced
carbon farming practices to increase the capture and storage of carbon within the soil. There is potential for the

New Zealand Agricultural Sector to show the world how to do it, and thus mitigate climate change whilst making
our land more productive and also to achieve a complete turn-around in our farmers' attitudes. I wish you all the
best in your mission! RB Yours sincerely, Ralph Boardman
