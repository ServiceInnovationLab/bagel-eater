Dear Sir or Madam,
Thank you for the opportunity to have a say on the proposed Zero Carbon Bill.
I am writing in support of vulnerable communities in developing countries, including in the Pacific, for whom dealing with the impacts
of climate change is already a daily reality. For people living in poverty, the changing climate threatens their ability to grow food,

maintain a safe water supply, provide for their families and stay healthy.
I believe we have a responsibility to support these vulnerable communities to adapt to the changing climate and break free from
poverty. As such, I ask that the Zero Carbon Bill become a tool to strengthen our climate assistance to developing countries.


Specifically, I encourage you to:
  1.  Include strong language in the Bill on our commitments to developing countries, as per Paris Agreement and the Sustainable
     Development Goals, particularly in the area of adaptation;
  2.  Set up a process, as part of the proposed Climate Change Commission, to ensure greater transparency and impact of our

     current and future climate finance to developing countries.
Regards
Alison Squires
