Carbon dioxide is NOT the control knob of Climate.The Sun governs Climate Change by the intensity of it's ''Solar
wind Strength''
I beg this Government to GET OUT of the PARIS ACCORD.The economic consequences of committing to ''ZERO
Carbon ''will be CATASTROPHIC..The positives of the Paris Accord ??? There are NONE.It is our Sun That IS the

Control Knob of climate change.And it is TOO HOT TO HANDEL.
Yours Sincerely and finally
William Partridge B.Sc. London
