Climate change is an important issue in our generation and we can't sit here and do nothing. Ideally a 1• increase

would be better but I realise that is unlikely to happen. Therefore we need to aim for 1.5• not 2•. Even if we aim for
2• there is no guarantee that we will meet it. At least by going with the smaller amount people across the world are
more likely to do more to slow down this increase in temperature. They do say reach for the stars and get the
moon. On top of this even if we stopped everything that increases the process of climate change today there would

still be a future increase. It is like you have water that is dyed blue. If you slowly add red food colouring the water
will change purple. Not all the red mixes at first. This means that even if you stop adding red it could still become a
redder shade of purple. The blue represents the climate, red is the green house gases, and purple is increase in
temperature. This shows that we can't stop after the increase has risen to 1.5 or 2• it has to be before. Therefore it
is extremely important that acts like these go through so we can slow down this process and keep the world closer

to the temperature it is now and lessen the more dramatic changes that will soon occur. Yours sincerely, Samantha
Cameron
