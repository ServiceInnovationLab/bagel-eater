 Purpose of the proposed zero-carbon bill

     The purpose of the proposed zero-carbon bill should be much more substantive than setting targets.

     Had this bill been proposed 30 years ago when Dr James Hansen testified to a then-receptive United States Senate, a targets-based bill might have

     been entirely appropriate. In 2018, there is vanishing likelihood that we have the luxury or a further two decades before becoming zero-carbon.

 Name of proposed climate commission

     Names are crucially important. If the purpose of an equivalent of the United Kingdom’s Committee on Climate Change is climate action, then the
     proposed climate commission should be titled: Climate-Action Commission

 Deep review of emissions trading scheme

     New Zealand’s emissions trading scheme is an abject failure. The proposed zero-carbon bill must allow for a deep review of the scheme and open-
     mindedly assess alternatives to it, including the straight fee-and-dividend mechanism consistently advocated by Dr James Hansen, or a carbon tax

     and climate-action quantitative easing approach possibly better suited the a less tax-averse country.

 Science advisor to the climate-action commission

     In the government’s 61-page discussion document Our Climate Your Say, the word science appears only 9 times.


     For the proposed climate bill to be robust, an evidence-based approach is non-optional. In particular, the proposed climate commission must
     include a fulltime chief science advisor role.


     The discussion document mentions electric vehicles six times, public transport four times. The Committee on Climate Change’s 2018 progress
     report to United Kingdom Parliament mentions public transport 13 times, culminating with: Public transport must be incentivised.

     Professor Sir Peter Gluckman’s Methamphetamine Contamination in Residential Properties: Exposures, Risk Levels, and Interpretation of Standards

     is testimony the need for evidence-based policy-making. Likewise, a zero-carbon bill that panders to the popular notion that global warming can be
     prevented by painless switch to electric vehicles, and batteries photovoltaic panels is, as the former United Kingdom government’s Department of
     Energy and Climate Change chief scientific adviser, the late Professor David MacKay, in his last-ever interview, an “appalling delusion.”

 Imperative for holistic approach to climate action

     Because humanity has painted itself into a corner with its greenhouse gas emissions, climate action must be addressed with every policy decision

     addressing urgent issues in every other theatre.

     An example is the global epidemic of noncommunicable diseases. It has been found that of all the interventions tried, such as incentivising
     healthier lifestyles, public transport, and only public transport, makes a significant, positive impact.


     The holistic approach, then, is the most cost-effective route to meaningful climate action.

 Other

     I believe that encouragement for every household to participate in growing its own food, a bin of maori potatoes in the front yard, a strip in the
     community garden, a farmer co-operative, will draw people away from trivial pursuits, snacking in front of the TV, driving to the weekend sales,

     driving to rainbow's end, that consume and pollute. Manual work, shared with the community, has given people optimism and courage for
     thousands of years.
