Give us some incentives
Ie I install solar panels, why does it take so long to recoup my initial investment

I should be able to supply all of my own energy needs and export any excess into the grid.
Renationalise our energy system
I should be able to charge my electric car at home.
Our whole economy seems to be geared to someone else's programme

Therefore we cannot chart our own futures
