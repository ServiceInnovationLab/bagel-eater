Dear Minister, I support the passing of legally binding climate law. The legislation should establish the goal of

limiting warming to 1.5 degrees. I support the inclusion of ALL greenhouse gases in the legislation, this is
consistent with international climate frameworks. The emissions from the agricultural sector must be controlled. I
support the establishment of a Climate Commission, whose role should be to devise binding budgets and have the
authority to enforce regulations. I do not support the use of carbon credits or carbon trading. Emission cuts must

be real - not on paper. The effects of climate change are already apparent and will only become more destructive
with time. Major changes to commerce are required as this problem has been caused by humankind's 'usual
business'. Legislation is required as well as education and planning for adapting. The Climate Commission will
need both regulatory power and funding for education. I appreciate the effort of all involved to address this issue.
Yours sincerely, Tracy Abbot
