Dear Minister, I support the passing of legally binding climate law. Climate breakdown, what it should be called, as

well as nuclear war both threaten humanity. Even Noam Chomsky says so. It's an international issue that requires
international response of course. NZ must do its part. Yours sincerely, Martin Griffiths
