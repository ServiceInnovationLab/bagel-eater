Dear Minister, I enthusiastically support the passing of legally binding climate law! The law must be fair, ambitious

and consistent with the climate science and international frameworks by including ALL gases and ALL sectors.
There must be rapid cuts in all greenhouse gases in New Zealand beginning NOW. I support a net-zero target of
2040 with the majority of cuts occurring over the next decade. I support the establishment of a New Zealand
Climate Commission, whose role should be to devise binding budgets and time frames. I especially support the

‘firewall’ principle, that New Zealand’s targets must be achieved by ACTUAL CUTS IN OUR OWN EMISSIONS., and
not through the purchase of overseas carbon credits or an over-reliance on forests as carbon sinks! Yours
sincerely, Lisa Powers
