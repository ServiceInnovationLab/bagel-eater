Subject: Zero Carbon Bill
     The Zero Carbon Bill will create a vast bureaucracy: A Climate Change Commission, ‘emissions budgets’, climate change

     adaptation plans, and emissions targets.

     The Bill presents three options for emissions targets for 2050. The first would regulate only carbon dioxide, the second
     carbon dioxide and methane, and the third carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and any other gases they can find.
     The second and third options are designed to target farmers, as environmental extremists want to see stock numbers
     reduced and farming limited as an economic activity.

     While most methane in New Zealand is produced by ruminants digesting food, it is not the problem the activists are

     making it out to be. Soil scientist, Dr Doug Edmeades, explains that since livestock are carbon neutral, methane from
     agriculture should not be included in emissions targets.

     In fact, no gases should be included in emissions targets, because just like the Emissions Trading Scheme, James Shaw’s
     proposed Zero Carbon Bill will create a costly nightmare of red tape and bureaucracy that will waste time and money,
     drag down the economy, and destroy businesses and jobs – without having any impact at all on the climate. The Zero

     Carbon Bill should be suspended - indefinitely!
