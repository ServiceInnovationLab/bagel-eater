Dear Ministry for the Environment,


I believe in a net-zero carbon future for New Zealand. We need to make dramatic reductions in our emissions to
keep climate change limited to 1.5 degrees and ensure our precious native plants and animals are protected.
Nature is our taonga and we cannot exist without it. We must act together.


The key things I support in a Zero Carbon Act are:

     target for net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 should be in the Act.
     The emissions from transport, industrial activity, agriculture, and all other sources should be included in the
     target. Even ‘short-lived’ gasses can have a huge effect on our climate and need to be reduced.

     Emissions budgets should be at least as important as fiscal budgets, and the Government should set plans to
     achieve them.
     An independent Climate Change Commission of experts should monitor emissions and give advice to keep New
     Zealand on-track for its emissions reduction goals.

Is there anything you'd like to add?
I believe in the interests of the welfare and wellbeing of our mokopuna, their mokopuna and our indigenous

animals and plants that New Zealand has a moral duty to ensure that we do all that we can to keep climate change
below 1.5 degrees C. Thus the minimum we should look to implement would be a net-zero carbon emissions Act
with teeth to ensure that it can withstand actions of future changes in government that may look to dilute it.

Please ask the Ministry for the Environment to withhold my name and personal details from public
