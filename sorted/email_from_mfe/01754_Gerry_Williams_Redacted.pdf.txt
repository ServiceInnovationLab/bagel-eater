Subject: Zero Carbon Bill

Good morning
I wish to register that I am totally against the Zero Carbon bill and the damage it will do for the economy.
We cannot continue to be the ideological leader in the world in these unproven and dubious areas of science – there is sufficient
evidence to suggest that the science being applied by the moralists is erroneous.

Climate change has been occurring for as long as we have had a climate and only a very small proportion of that is man-made.
New Zealand will make no difference to the world unless the major polluters in the northern hemisphere significantly reduce industrial
emissions – which they wont. Thus why should we destroy our economy for some idealistic ideals.
Regards

Gerry Williams
