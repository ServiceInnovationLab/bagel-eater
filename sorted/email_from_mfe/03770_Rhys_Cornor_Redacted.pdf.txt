Dear Minister, I support the passing of legally binding climate law. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change

makes it clear that methane reduction is critical to success in tackling climate change. It is politically and
scientifically untenable for New Zealand’s climate law to exclude any gases from our biggest emitting sector - the
agricultural sector. I support the establishment of a Climate Commission, whose role should be to devise binding
budgets. I support the ‘firewall’ principle, that New Zealand’s targets must be achieved by actual cuts in our own

emissions, and not through the purchase of overseas carbon credits or an over-reliance on forests as carbon sinks
My idea which may be yours as well is to get the car companies to only manufacture electric cars from now on.
Yours sincerely, Rhys Cornor
