Dear Madam / Sir

                          Submission on the Zero Carbon Bill from Dorothy Williams

This is our chance. I'm excited to be submitting on the Zero Carbon Bill because Dear Sir or Madam
I'm enthusiastic about the Zero Carbon Bill because this is our chance to put right the mistakes of the past, when

carbon emissions went unchecked . We now have a situation where we need to act promptly to reverse some of the
damage created by the blase use of ozone-depleting substances.

2050 target


Q1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation? (In legislation
now, or later via the Climate Commission?)

In the interests of clarity a target should be set now. This will help the industry and transport and agricultural
sectors adapt gradually so that they can meet the 2050 deadline.


Q2. Which is the best 2050 target for New Zealand? (Which emissions should be covered and how?)

We need the most ambitious target: net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases, not just some. There is little
point in just dealing with part of this problem. We now have the will to act, let us not leave things to drift any

longer. The long-lasting gases should be the major priority and all gases should be subjected to the 2050 deadline.
This is our 'nuclear' moment and an opportunity to be the leader and not the sheep.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its targets? (Within New Zealand, or with international trading too?)


We should try to avoid buying credits which are just an excuse for those countries who cannot meet their
obligations. In your proposals you mention increasing forested areas by tree-planting. If every household, above a
certain income, were to plant one tree it would increase buy-in from the public and reduce the amount coming out
of Treasury coffers.


Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

Only in a national emergency, for example a disastrous volcanic eruption. The 2050 deadline should hold fast for
any lesser circumstance.


Emissions budgets

Q5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be
in place at any given time. Do you agree with this proposal?


As in your proposals the Government should set 3 x five-year targets which cannot be altered on the whim of any
subsequent Government except in an emergency, for example a natural disaster.

Q6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?


No. Emissions budgets should be only be changed due to major changes in scientific understanding, not political or
economic developments. The same 'no backsliding' principle should apply as for the 2050 target.


Q7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific
range under exceptional circumstances?

No, for the same reasons as in my answer to Q6.


Q8. Do you agree with the proposed considerations that the Government and the Climate Commission will need to
take into account when advising on and setting budgets?

Yes, I agree that they will need to consider:
- scientific knowledge regarding climate change

- technology relevant to climate change
- social circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel poverty
- energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy supplies and the carbon and energy intensity of the
economy
- economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the economy, as well as the competitiveness of

particular sectors of the economy
- fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on taxation, public spending and public borrowing

Government response
Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the
emissions budgets?


Yes, the Act should set fixed deadlines, so we don't repeat the mistakes of the UK Climate Change Act 2008, which
didn't include deadlines for making these plans.


Q10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For
example, who do we need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

In setting plans to meet the emissions budgets, the government should be:
- making sure they're based on the best science available

- ensuring that they deliver fair outcomes for Kiwis
- reflecting the principle of a Just Transition for workers
- honouring Te Tiriti o Waitangi
- being environmentally sustainable, especially for New Zealand's unique native plants and animals
- maximising the impact of money spent and being cost-effective

- encouraging innovation
- unlocking economic opportunities for New Zealanders, such as in renewable energy
- honouring our international commitments, including under the Paris Agreement
- consulting people who may be economically affected, like farmers or businesses
- consulting tangata whenua

- consulting young people, who'll live to see more of the impact of climate change
- consulting communities already facing the physical impacts of climate change

Climate Change Commission


Q11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's
progress towards its goals. Do you agree with these functions?

Yes, I agree with this. Independent advice and monitoring is essential to ensure accountability.


Q12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)? (Should it provide advice, or make decisions too?)

The Commission should advise the government on policy around the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme.


Q13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and
desirable expertise. Do you agree with the proposed expertise?

I agree that members of the Climate Commission should have expertise in all of the following:


- climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
- climate change policy (including emissions trading)
- te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori (Māori language, culture, and philosophy) and Māori interests
- knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology development system

- risk management
- resource economics and impacts (including labour markets and distribution)
- experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning, insurance and local government
- engineering and/or infrastructure

- community engagement and communications
- business competitiveness

In addition, they should have expertise in:
- expertise in public health

- understanding of our international commitments, including under the Paris Agreement
- understanding of the social impacts of climate change and/or government policy
- knowledge of principles of equity and a Just Transition

Adapting to the impact of climate change


Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Yes. The curved balls need to be covered and a special Ad Hoc committee of the Zero Carbons Commission could
help here.

Q15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree
with the proposed functions?

Yes, the Zero Carbon Act should require:


- a national climate change risk assessment
- a national adaptation plan
- regular reviews of progress towards implementing the national adaptation plan
- an adaptation reporting power
Care will need to be taken in managing the interaction between national and local government roles.

Q16. Should the Government explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some

organisations share information on their exposure to climate change risks?

Yes. This would let the government and the public know about the risks to public and other infrastructure, and
make these organisations better informed about the risks they face.


An extra point to consider - climate finance

The Zero Carbon Act should also provide a framework for transparency and accountability around New Zealand's
international climate finance.


Conclusion

Thank you for this chance to submit on the Zero Carbon Bill. It's vital that we get it right now so that we make an
environment that is safe for all species of creatures and to maximise the ability for robust growth of vegetation

while setting an example for other peoples.

Yours faithfully

Dorothy Williams
