Dear Minister, I support the passing of legally binding climate law. Please pass the Zero Carbon Act in its full form.

We need to act now. The law needs to be in line with the climate science and international frameworks by including
all gases and all sectors. The legislation needs to limit warming to 1.5 degrees. We should not settle for 2 degrees
warming, that would have devastating impacts on our Pacific neighbours and cause significant extinctions. There
needs to be rapid cuts in all greenhouse gases beginning now. I support a net-zero target of 2040 with the majority

of cuts occurring over the next decade. I support all greenhouse gases being included in the law, consistent with
international climate frameworks. Methane reduction is critical to success in tackling climate change. We cannot
exclude the agricultural sector and we need to work with farmers. I support the establishment of a Climate
Commission. New Zealandâ€™s targets must be achieved by actual cuts in our own emissions, and not through the
purchase of overseas carbon credits or an over-reliance on forests as carbon sinks While consensus across political

parties is good, any cross-party agreement should not be achieved at the cost of strong climate law. Climate change
is the greatest challenge facing humanity. The world needs transformational change if we are to avoid catastrophic
warming. New Zealand has a transformational government which needs to be bold and pass strong law for the
sake of our precious earth and future generations. Yours sincerely, Sarah Martin
