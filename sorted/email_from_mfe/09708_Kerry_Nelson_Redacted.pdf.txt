Our farm animals are suffering, for a start we could stop intensivist farming which causes stress for these

wonderful creatures. They are not healthy you can see this by their stool ie that they have continuous diarrhea.
Also felling of trees is done irresponsibly shown by the floods and logs clogging rivers bridges and homes recently.
Trees as you probably know release oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide emissions. Also importantly they prevent
erosion and would stop the silting shown in our waterways

Stop CPTPP there is a danger that other Countries corporations and law makers will expect us to continue with
these practices and sue
