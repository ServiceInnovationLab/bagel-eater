Subject: Zero Carbon Bill
The Climate Change Team

Climate Change is an issue which affects all New Zealanders and some rational thinking needs to be

brought to bear on the topic before any detrimental effects are made to the New Zealand economy by
the introduction of the Zero Carbon Bill. There is such a lot of hype as to whether or not humans are
changing the climate that one can be forgiven for being confused and not knowing what is true and

what is not. Thus one of the biggest challenges facing us all is the challenge of distinguishing the
facts from the propaganda. One does not need to be a scientist with qualifications in some unique
speciality to be able to find out whether a particular finding is true or false. The internet is such a

wide source of information that anyone can use to reach a reasoned conclusion about many things.

The prime narrative of Climate Change (previously Global Warming) is based on the premise that
humans are producing so much carbon dioxide that this is causing a run-away warming of the
atmosphere which is detrimental to life on the planet. Therefor the first question to research is: Does

carbon dioxide have a heating effect? Most people know from their school days that atmospheric
carbon dioxide produces a “Greenhouse effect” around the planet which traps some of the heat from
the Sun. Carbon dioxide thus does play a role in keeping the planet warm. This is pretty well

established and can be easily verified.

The next question is: Does the carbon dioxide produced by humans warm the atmosphere by any
significant amount, that is, by an amount which is detrimental to us? Here is where the questions

start getting difficult. On the one side the radical climate change deniers say that there is no heating
effect whatsoever, and on the other side the global warming activists are saying that the effect is
catastrophic. Who do you believe? Perhaps there is a middle ground? A search of the internet will

show that the scientists for human caused climate change have put forward climate modeling which
is said to demonstrate a link between carbon dioxide and exponential temperature increases. Such
modeling has been continually revised for many years and the projected outcomes have been widely
broadcast in the media and portrayed in films and documentaries such as Al Gore’s “An Inconvenient

Truth” and Michael Mann’s “hockey stick” graph showing a projected exponential increase in
temperates from the 1990s onwards (i). However the modeling has failed and the dire predictions of
Al Gore have not come to pass. Al Gore alleged that within 10 years the temperature as shown by the

Hockey Stick graph would be so high that the Arctic Ice would have melted, glaciers in Europe would
no longer exist, sea level would have risen to engulf coastal cities, that polar bears in Canada would
be near extinct etc, etc (ii), (iii). The RSS satellite recordings of the planet’s temperature over the last

19 years have shown next to no increase even though the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
has increased in that time from around 370 parts per million to around 410ppm today (iv). The
Hockey Stick data have been called into question (v) because of fundamental flaws in the selection of

the data time scale as well as questions on the appropriateness of using the particular tree ring data
(details of which Michael Mann refuses to release). What is one to make of this modeling? One can
certainly say that the models are wrong in that their predictions are incorrect. One cannot say from
that conclusion that an increase in carbon dioxide is not detrimental to the planet. So where is the

evidence that carbon dioxide is detrimental?

We know that carbon dioxide is essential to life. Without it we would not be here. Plants thrive on
carbon dioxide and the increases in the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere over recent years

have even had a slight greening effect on the planet (vi). It is known that life on the planet
proliferated during the Carboniferous Period when the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
was, on average, around 800 ppm, that is twice today’s level (vii).
What do we conclude so far? Well there is no evidence that carbon dioxide is detrimental to life. There
is no evidence that there is any significant temperature increase accompanying the increase in

carbon dioxide (even though many people in New Zealand would welcome a slightly warmer climate).
So what is all the fuss about? Why does the climate appear to be changing? Once again, by delving
into this one comes up with a whole host of natural causes. Those causes mainly comprise the effect
of the sun, but also include to a lessor extent the ocean currents, and large scale terrestrial events.

The sun’s effect is due to the amount of electromagnetic radiation which it emits and which reach the
earth. This varies with the changing orbit of the Earth around the sun, the rotation of the Earth on its
axis, the Earth’s precession (axial movement), and solar occurrences such as solar flares, sun spots
and coronal loops (viii). The ocean currents have an effect on climate as can be seen in New Zealand,

and more particularly in Australia, when the currents causing the El Nino and La Nina effects occur
at different periods of time (ix). Terrestrial events include such events as major earth disruptions
brought about when large volcanoes emit copious amounts of particulates and noxious gases over
large scale regions, and when asteroids hit the planet as occurred to cause the extinction of the

dinosaurs.

The Earth’s climate has been changing ever since it was formed. These changes are due to natural
events and are of such a macroscopic scope that it would be irrational to think that human’s minute
addition of carbon dioxide could possibly have any effect on the climate which could have any similar

influencing effect.

Then why is there such a hullabaloo about climate change coming through the main stream media? If
one hones down, one can see that this comes from a group originating within the UN which is pushing
an agenda for the even distribution of wealth throughout the world. It has publicly stated “...we

redistribute de facto the world’s wealth by climate policy...” (x).The resultsof this are the various
climate accords which countries have been cajoled into signing over recent years and culminating in
the recent Paris Climate Change Agreement. These accords have given rise to emission trading
schemes which requires countries to pay for the “carbon” that they emit. The cost to the New

Zealand economy has been calculated by one group (xi) to be in the order of $1.4 billion per year for a
decade. This money will go to big pollutingcountries, such as India and China,to pay them to reduce
their emissions.

There are many misconceptions and seemingly persuasive arguments on the climate change agenda

which the public are fed. Some of these are:

1. The confusion between pollution and carbon dioxide. As noted above, carbon dioxide is not a
pollutant. It is a colourless, odourless, harmless gas present in the atmosphere in a minuteamount of
0.04%. Compare this with 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and 0.4% water vapour.


2. People who question anthropogenic climate change are considered to be reprehensible and are
often categorized as “climate deniers”, on the same par as holocaust deniers, when all they are doing
is questioning the data.

3. People who agree that there is anthropogenic climate change are often derided as “greenie

activists” notwithstanding that they are simply going along with what they are told by the main
stream media.

4. Not all GreenPeace adherents are fully in agreement with the climate change narrative. The
founder of GreenPeace, Patrick Moore, does not agree that there is anthropogenic climate change

(xii).

5. Sea level rise has not been proven to be the result of anthropogenic climate change. The sea level
has been rising ever since the Earth came out of the last Ice Age some 10,000 years ago. The rise in
sea level has been recently measured as being in the order of 2.5cm every 10 years (xiii). This is

hardly anything to worry about.

6. Weather events are often conflicted with climate change. Weather events are small time events
whereas climate change occurs on a large time scale. Weather events such as droughts, cyclones, and
torrential rain etc have been occurring for millennia and are not restricted to recent time periods.

7.The statement that “The science is settled” regarding anthropogenic climate change, is factually

false. No science is always settled, it is an on-going process of enquiry. This is just as true for climate
science as it was for Newton’s law of gravity.

8. “97% of scientists agree with climate change” is a common catchphrase heard. However what does
it mean? It is by no means clear what exactly they agree with. Research on the internet shows that

one of the main originators of this was John Cook of the Global Change Institute. However many have
questioned his study as being flawed in the way he interpreted and selected his data (xiv). All that
can be said therefor is that the catchphrase is open to question and should not be given any undue

weight in any debate. Apart from whether or not the catchphrase is true, any scientist worth his/her
salt will know that a majority of views on a subject is not conclusive of evidence in support of the
subject (eg refer to the widely held view that the Earth was the centre of our Solar System, or the fact
that Einstein’s Theory of Relativity was initially brushed aside by many of his contemporaries in

Europe, as being fanciful).There is also the Petition signed by 31,487 US Scientists that there is no
convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide will cause catastrophic heating of
the Earth’ atmosphere (xv). This also places some credibility issues on the 97%.

The overall conclusion which can be reached upon a broad review of all the evidence to date is that

carbon dioxide produced by humans has not been proven to have a detrimental effect on the Earth's
climate and is, in fact, essential to plant growth and the sustainability of human life. It is further
submitted that the proposed Zero Carbon Bill will do great harm to the New Zealand economy by
imposing unnecessary financial and distressful burdens on the lives of all New Zealanders causing

untold pain and suffering.
