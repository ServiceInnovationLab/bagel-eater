Zero carbon Bill You have heard of banana republics. If this bill is passed and is implemented our economy will
stagnate and we will become the cot case of the Pacific. Because the science behind this bill is based on computer
modelling which has proven to be false and paints an exaggerated picture of future climate warming being caused
by Carbon dioxide is brought into question. Studies have shown that the the increase in global temperatures in the

latter part of the 20th century can be explained by naturally occurring phenomena which include El Niño and La
Niña events and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). The effect of
CO2 on temperatures is minuscule if at al and methane even less with no other country in the world prepared to
tax it as it has a limited life in the atmosphere. It should be noted that not one of the signatories to the Paris
Agreement on Climate has been able to meet its Carbon emissions targets. John Baird
