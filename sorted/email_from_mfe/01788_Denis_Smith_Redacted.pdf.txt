Subject: ZERO CARBON BILL
Hi,
I am opposed to this bill.
CO2 is not the bogey that it is portrayed as, and I do not see the need to impose pressures on our producers and particularly

farmers.
Therefore there is no need to set up, a commission (yet another one) to oversee this matter.
Kind regards,
Denis Smith.
