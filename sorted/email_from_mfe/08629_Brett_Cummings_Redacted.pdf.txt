Subject: Submission on the Zero Carbon Bill Dear Minister, I support the passing of legally binding climate law I
think this is achievable by returning the westcoast stewardship land to the westcoast community so that they xcan
plant it all in trees for the future benifit of all. Yours sincerely, Brett Cummings
