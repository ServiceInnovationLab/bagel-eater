Dear Minister, I support the ZCA. This is great progress for the country. However we can do more. We need to lead

the world by setting more ambitious goals, such as a net zero target by 2040, and a maximum temperature increase
of 1.5degC by the end of the century. We also need to reduce methane emissions in the agricultural sector, while
still maintaining farming as the backbone of our economy. I support the establishment of a Climate Commission. I
also support the ‘firewall’ principle of achieving lower emissions through cuts rather than credits. Finally, I

wholeheartedly encourage the use of the phrase "Global Pollution Epidemic" over "Climate Change" or "Global
Warming" as this reframes the problem as human induced, rather than a passive process that climate skeptics
might easily attribute to natural causes. We need to take ownership of our problems, and some rephrasing of the
issue may help public perception. Thank you for your time. Keep fighting the good fight. Yours sincerely, David
Patterson
