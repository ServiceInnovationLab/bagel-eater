Dear Minister, I support the passing of legally binding climate law that would establish the goal of limiting warming

to 1.5 degrees - any higher and we would be condoning devastating impacts on Pacific Island states and Pacific
fauna and flora. To achieve this I support a net-zero target of 2040 with the majority of cuts occurring over the next
decade. I support the establishment of a Climate Commission, whose role should be to devise binding budgets. The
Climate Commission should have statutory teeth, otherwise it is merely an advisory group that governments could

ignore. Climate budgets should be legally binding and set a bare-minimum ambition, which must be achieved or
bettered by government within the prescribed time-frames. While budgets should be binding, policy
recommendations from the Commission should be just that - recommendations. Although it would be good to
achieve cross-party consensus such agreement should not be achieved at the cost of strong climate law. New
Zealand must lead with bold, strong law for the sake of our precious earth and future generations. Yours sincerely,

Heather Sylvawood
