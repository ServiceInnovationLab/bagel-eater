Dear Minister, I am delighted that the proposed Carbon Zero Act is to be considered by government. I hope all

parties will be able to agree on a strong act and will pass it into law. The law must be fair, ambitious and consistent
with the climate science and international frameworks by including all gases and all sectors. The main things I
support in a Zero Carbon Act are:  The legislation should establish the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees.       I
support a target for net-zero emissions by 2040.  I support all greenhouse gases being included in the law.  I

support New Zealandâ€™s targets being achieved by actual cuts in our own emissions, and not through the purchase
of overseas carbon credits.  I support the establishment of an independent Climate Change Commission of experts
who should monitor emissions and give advice to the Government as well as devise binding emissions budgets.
New Zealand must be bold and pass strong law for the sake of our precious earth and future generations. Yours
sincerely, Linley Gregory
