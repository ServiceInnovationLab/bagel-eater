Dear Minister, I don't support the passing of legally binding climate law in NZ unless there is a legal commitment

from the USA, India, Russia, China, Indonesia & a majority of the other major contributors to the earths climate
change problems. There is no point in our tiny contribution being removed when on its own it will do nothing to
effect climate change, but will put us at a great disadvantage financially with the rest of the developed world. . .
Yours sincerely, David Nicol
