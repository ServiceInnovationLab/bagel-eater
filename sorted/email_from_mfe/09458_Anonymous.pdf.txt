Dear Ministry for the Environment,


I believe in a net-zero carbon future for New Zealand. We need to make dramatic reductions in our emissions to
keep climate change limited to 1.5 degrees and ensure our precious native plants and animals are protected.
Nature is our taonga and we cannot exist without it. We must act together.


The key things I support in a Zero Carbon Act are:

     target for net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 should be in the Act.
     The emissions from transport, industrial activity, agriculture, and all other sources should be included in the
     target. Even ‘short-lived’ gasses can have a huge effect on our climate and need to be reduced.

     Emissions budgets should be at least as important as fiscal budgets, and the Government should set plans to
     achieve them.
     An independent Climate Change Commission of experts should monitor emissions and give advice to keep New
     Zealand on-track for its emissions reduction goals.



My details and further comments on my submission:

Is there anything you'd like to add?
I believe that our farming industry needs to be accountable for its effects in relation to Carbon emissions. A recent

article in the journal Science, that analyzed research from almost 40,000 farms in 119 countries, and covering
climate change emissions, freshwater use, as well as water and air pollution, found that even the very lowest
impact meat and dairy products are responsible for more environmental harm than the least sustainable vegetable
and cereal growing.
