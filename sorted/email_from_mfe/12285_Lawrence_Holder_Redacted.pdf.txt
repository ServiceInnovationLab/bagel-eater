Dear Ministry for the Environment,


I believe in a net-zero carbon future for New Zealand. We need to make dramatic reductions in our emissions to
keep climate change limited to 1.5 degrees and ensure our precious native plants and animals are protected.
Nature is our taonga and we cannot exist without it. We must act together.


The key things I support in a Zero Carbon Act are:

     target for net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 should be in the Act.
     The emissions from transport, industrial activity, agriculture, and all other sources should be included in the
     target. Even ‘short-lived’ gasses can have a huge effect on our climate and need to be reduced.

     Emissions budgets should be at least as important as fiscal budgets, and the Government should set plans to
     achieve them.
     An independent Climate Change Commission of experts should monitor emissions and give advice to keep New
     Zealand on-track for its emissions reduction goals.

Is there anything you'd like to add?
we need to get on with it now,,,,,,1.5 degrees is too much, our government needs to offer incentives for the uptake

of energy independence using solar PV panels and battery storage on all homes and electric vehicle use ,
encourage agriculture , move away from intensive dairy practices and become 100% renewable energy generation
ASAP. any reporting system needs to be robust and transparent for all to see and the governing body needs to
have real power to bring about change and control polluting industries, the world needs to do more now
