Subject: James Shaw’s proposed Zero Carbon Bill
I am strongly against James Shaw’s proposed Zero Carbon Bill. I believe that all it will do is create a costly
nightmare of red tape and bureaucracy that will waste time and money, drag down the economy, and destroy

businesses and jobs – all for no benefit.
Especially, no gases should be included in any emissions targets. In typical fashion, the Greens have highlighted
the (methane) emissions from farm animals, without acknowledging that these animals all eat grass, which contains
carbon. Thus, what they ingest goes some way to off-setting what they emit. But since this weakens/does not suit

their argument, they conveniently ignore this fact.
We should all do out part in protecting the planet, for future generations, but taking a radical approach, with many
drawbacks (especially for the citizens and economy of NZ), is not the right way to do this.

Yours sincerely
Laurie Wright
