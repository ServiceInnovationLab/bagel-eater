Subject: Zero Carbon Act
Dear James,
I'm writing in support of the Zero Carbon Act, yet do have concerns.
I'm a Kiwi who is presently living in London, not dissimilar from your own experience, and I'm concerned with our

present carbon outputs as a nation.
I've heard retorohic here that we, as NZer's want to be leaders and while we account for only a small proportion of
global carbon output we can be a model for other nations. What has been missing for me is that we are NOT
squeaky clean.

Our per capita carbon output ranking in the OECD has us placed far and beyond the average of our OECD counter-
parts, we can say we want to be a model for others to follow in how we address our carbon outputs as a nation, but
we MUST first recognise our own failings in managing our carbon outputs today rather than talking about our
relative global proportion which will not change public behaviour.
I've heard you speak of your business background as a consultant and your commitment to seeing business and

sustainability functioning in partnership. Yet we still support large scale dairy projects to occur in our non-
traditional dairy regions on pristine and fragile alpine landscapes and we still allow foriegn investment to bottle
water for export in single use plastic containers taking millions of litres of water from NZ aquifers.
Fonterra has diversified, they have globally invested in farms outside of NZ, those profits will come back into the NZ

economy. Fonterra will survive a strong Zero Carbon Act and we should not make concessions at the expense of our
environment for which every NZer has a vested interest.
Best regards,
Jeremy Child
