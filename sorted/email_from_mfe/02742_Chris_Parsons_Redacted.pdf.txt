Dear Minister, I support the passing of legally binding climate law. The law must be fair, ambitious and consistent

with the climate science and international frameworks by including all gases and all sectors We should settle for 2
degrees I do not support all greenhouse gases being included in the law, methane produced by the farming sector
should be exclude. I do not support the establishment of Climate Commision I do not support the ‘firewall’
principle, that New Zealand’s targets must be achieved by actual cuts in our own emissions, and not through the

purchase of overseas carbon credits or an over-reliance on forests as carbon sinks While consensus across political
parties is good, any cross-party agreement should not be achieved at the cost of strong climate law. Over
population is the greatest challenge facing humanity. Yours sincerely, Chris Parsons
