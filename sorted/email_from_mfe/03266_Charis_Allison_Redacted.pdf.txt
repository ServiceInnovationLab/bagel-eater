Dear Minister, I just wanted to personally say that climate change is a huge problem as I am sure you are aware and

if we don't do something about it now, there will be no future. All the things that you and I enjoy about New Zeland
and this world will be gone for the next generation and generations after if we don't take a stand now and start
doing something. This will change New Zeland for the better and if we start then just think of all the other
countries who will follow because someone has made the path. Yours sincerely, Charis Allison
