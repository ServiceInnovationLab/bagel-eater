Dear Minister, I applaud the Coalition Government's intention to really address climate change by introduction of

the Zero Carbon Act. However, I urge that instead of aiming for a change of 2 degrees we lower the level to 1.5
degrees. This, I feel will really begin to make change effective. 2 degrees is the very upper limit allowable and one I
fear, we are on target to reach. Here is your opportunity to assure our young people that the Government is able to
deal with the horrendous scenario that is their future. I wish the Select Committee that will be considering my

submission to have committed cross-party representation and make recommendations that will be binding to all
future governments (with of course the usual reviews). My own recommendation is that the S. C.'s
recommendations are for the strongest most definite changes as we have as a world, run out of time to have soft
laws which achieve little. As a country, we must be realistic and recognise where our main methane output is
generated and tackle those at source - particularly agriculture and transport sectors. Only then can we begin to

create an economic and social framework for dealing with and achieving a zero carbon result within the next few
years. We need to employ every possible method to both cut our output and absorb our carbon. And we need to
start as soon as possible. Lastly, I want this watershed-time to be a time to be regarded not as frightening, but one
we can handle and be thought of as a very positive step. Yours sincerely, Sue Stewart
