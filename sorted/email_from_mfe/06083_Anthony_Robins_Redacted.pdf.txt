Dear Minister, I support the passing of legally binding climate law. Our children deserve it. We can be leaders, both

morally, and in developing the benefits of a green economy. The alternative is to acquiesce to the destruction of a
liveable environment - which is madness. Yours sincerely, Anthony Robins
