Carbon emissions It is totally wrong for New Zealand to have a target of reducing carbon emissions to zero. Where
is the scientific evidence that supports that man made carbon emissions cause climate change,and that any
changes in our climate are anything other than the natural climatic changes that occur and have been occurring
over the history of the world. What evidence is there that New Zealand farming or horticulture is contributing to

man made climate change. Where is the evidence that shows that New Zealand farming and agriculture with its
mainly grass based dairy,beef and sheep farming is anything but carbon neutral as the huge carbon sink that our
green grass in our pastures together with our urban lawns,gardens and road verges creates must offset the
emissions from the farming sector. New Zealand is unique in being so green and also surrounded by vast oceans
that are also a huge carbon sink with all the plankton that absorbs carbon. New Zealand does not have the large

regular occurring wild fires that other countries like Australia and America have that emit vast quantities of
carbon. The minuscule amount of carbon emissions that New Zealand contribute in comparison to the volcanic
activity that occurs world wide each year shows that endeavouring to create a carbon free N.Z. Would not have any
significant effect even if it could be proved that carbon emissions do creat climate change. Bryan Darragh
