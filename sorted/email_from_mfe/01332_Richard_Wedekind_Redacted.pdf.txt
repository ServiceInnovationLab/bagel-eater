Dear Madam / Sir

                         Submission on the Zero Carbon Bill from Richard Wedekind

This is our chance. I'm excited to be submitting on the Zero Carbon Bill because For too long parliament has relied
on denial, obfuscation and lies to ignore the risk imposed by 'business-as-usual' economics. The science on climate

change remains as dire as it was 30 years ago when Dr James Hansen testified to the Senate. If anythig it has got
worse. New Zealand has a reputation for punching above it's weight and standing up for what is right and proper.
Let NZ be a beacon to the world and adopt the Zero Carbon Bill. It needs to apply across all jusridictions and
interests equally and should incorporate a tax on all CO2 equivalent emissions with the proceeds distributed
equally to all citizens.


2050 target

Q1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation? (In legislation
now, or later via the Climate Commission?)


Deferring a decision is just kicking the can down the road and avoiding what is required. Polluters want to defer
and delay by any means. We need firm, binding legislation now.

Q2. Which is the best 2050 target for New Zealand? (Which emissions should be covered and how?)


All greenhouse emissions need to be included without deferrals, delays or offsets. Dirty industries have known
their status for decades and if they have done nothing, they have been wasting their time and endangering all of
us.


Q3. How should New Zealand meet its targets? (Within New Zealand, or with international trading too?)

Exporting emissions or trading credits is not a solution. Zero emissions means zero emissions.


Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

In all probability we will find actions is falling behind what is required and will need to toughen measures.

Emissions budgets


Q5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be
in place at any given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

Yes. Emissions budgets under the Zero Carbon Act should cover five year periods and be set three budgets in

advance. This will provide long-term certainty.

Q6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

No. Emissions budgets should be only be changed due to major changes in scientific understanding, not political or

economic developments. The same 'no backsliding' principle should apply as for the 2050 target.

Q7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific
range under exceptional circumstances?


No, for the same reasons as in my answer to Q6.

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed considerations that the Government and the Climate Commission will need to
take into account when advising on and setting budgets?


Yes, I agree that they will need to consider:
- scientific knowledge regarding climate change
- technology relevant to climate change
- social circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel poverty

- energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy supplies and the carbon and energy intensity of the
economy
- economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the economy, as well as the competitiveness of
particular sectors of the economy
- fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on taxation, public spending and public borrowing


But none should be used as an excuse for deferring or delaying the ultimate goal of zero carbon emissions. There
will need to be some sacrifices made, the politicians need to bring the country with them.
Government response

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the

emissions budgets?

Yes, the Act should set fixed deadlines, so we don't repeat the mistakes of the UK Climate Change Act 2008, which
didn't include deadlines for making these plans.


Q10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For
example, who do we need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

In setting plans to meet the emissions budgets, the government should be:

- making sure they're based on the best science available
- ensuring that they deliver fair outcomes for Kiwis
- reflecting the principle of a Just Transition for workers
- honouring Te Tiriti o Waitangi
- being environmentally sustainable, especially for New Zealand's unique native plants and animals

- maximising the impact of money spent and being cost-effective
- encouraging innovation
- unlocking economic opportunities for New Zealanders, such as in renewable energy
- honouring our international commitments, including under the Paris Agreement
- consulting people who may be economically affected, like farmers or businesses

- consulting tangata whenua
- consulting young people, who'll live to see more of the impact of climate change
- consulting communities already facing the physical impacts of climate change


But don't get bogged down in pleasing everyone. The rules need to be ambitious and effective in achieving targets.

Climate Change Commission

Q11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's

progress towards its goals. Do you agree with these functions?

Yes, I do. The Commission should provide expert independent advice, but not be a decision-maker.

Q12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions

Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)? (Should it provide advice, or make decisions too?)

The Commission should advise the government on policy around the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme.

Q13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and

desirable expertise. Do you agree with the proposed expertise?

I agree that members of the Climate Commission should have expertise in:

- climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori

- climate change policy (including emissions trading)
- te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori (Māori language, culture, and philosophy) and Māori interests
- knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology development system
- risk management

- resource economics and impacts (including labour markets and distribution)
- experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning, insurance and local government
- engineering and/or infrastructure
- community engagement and communications
- business competitiveness


In addition, they should have expertise in:
- expertise in public health
- understanding of our international commitments, including under the Paris Agreement
- understanding of the social impacts of climate change and/or government policy

- knowledge of principles of equity and a Just Transition

Adapting to the impact of climate change

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?


Yes. Significant change is already locked into the system. Sea level will continue to rise and adverse weather events
will become more frequent.


Q15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree
with the proposed functions?

Yes, the Zero Carbon Act should require:


- a national climate change risk assessment
- a national adaptation plan
- regular reviews of progress towards implementing the national adaptation plan
- an adaptation reporting power


Care will need to be taken in managing the interaction between national and local government roles.

Q16. Should the Government explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some

organisations share information on their exposure to climate change risks?

Yes. This would let the government and the public know about the risks to public and other infrastructure, and
make these organisations better informed about the risks they face.


An extra point to consider - climate finance

The Zero Carbon Act should also provide a framework for transparency and accountability around New Zealand's
international climate finance.


Conclusion

This is an important and exciting effort to recognise New Zealand's role and resaponsibility to address climate
change. We cannot stuff this up.


Yours faithfully

Richard Wedekind
