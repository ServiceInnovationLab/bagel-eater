Dear Minister, I DO NOT support the passing of legally binding climate law. This law is part of Agenda 21, an Earth

Summit contract signed by 179 countries in 1992 in Rio. It is a deliberate duping of the public. This contract was to
create the move by globalists for TOTAL control over land, sea, air, water, energy, space and cyberspace. One World
Government, one World Bank, One World Army, and one World Currency. The call for Zero Carbon is part of this
Agenda and needs to be stopped. Part of this total control is the Climate change that is facing humanity right now

because it involves the deliberate GEO-ENGINEERING of our skies and climate using technology that has been in
existence and used for decades by those in power. What is urgently needed is to address this problem by
consulting climate change specialists such as Dane Wigington and Matt Landman. The world needs pathways to
transformational change and we need human beings in power who are not afraid to address this issue for what it
is. Address and STOP the Geo-engineering, stop the aerosol spraying where forests, insects, and all life is being

decimated, the massive floods, the manufacturing of hurricanes, the manufacturing of massive snowfalls of
chemical snow that does not melt. If you care at all as a human being you will address this with people such as the
above named. If you do not address this you are complicit in crimes against humanity and the whole of life. Yours
sincerely, Aileen Lowe
