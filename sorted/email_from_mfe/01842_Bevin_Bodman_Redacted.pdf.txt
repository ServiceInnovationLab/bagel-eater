AM To: Climate Consultation Subject: Climate change Bill If NZ changes and most of the world does not, a number of
nations are opting out why should we do an action that will have serious consequences and a lower standard of
living for all New Zealanders. This bill is based on false data and socialists longing for power over all of us. It must

be thrown out. The worlds problem is population not polution. Bevin Bodmin                                            ---
