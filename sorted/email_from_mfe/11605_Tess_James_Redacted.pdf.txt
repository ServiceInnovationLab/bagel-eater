Kia ora,


I would like to add my support for establishing an independent Climate Change commission. I would also like this
commission, if established, to look the possibility of New Zealand even becoming carbon neutral by 2040.

As the effects of climate change are becoming more and more visible, we must act quickly and boldly. New Zealand
has the potential to make a huge impact on the success of stopping the worst effects of climate change by being an

inspirational moral and practical leader in the global community. What we do now will effect all future generations
and the time is for urgent action.

I am so grateful and pleased that we now have a minister for Climate Change, that there is general support across
parties for collectively tackling this issue and that serious action is finally being begun to be taken.

Yours sincerely,


Tess (Teresa) James
