Dear Madam / Sir

                           Submission on the Zero Carbon Bill from Martha G. Bell

This is our chance. I'm excited to be submitting on the Zero Carbon Bill because Even though freedom of movement
is a human right enshrined in the UN Declaration of Human Rights, the resources needed to sustain current levels

of commercial, industrial, domestic, leisure and political mobilities are exhausted and the more resources we try to
extract, the more damage their extraction and combustion cause. So as a planetary people we have reached peak
oil and must begin to repair the damage which burning energy has caused. We have also reached "peak mobility" in
which we have a highly mobile elite and a mobile poor fleeing war, violence and poverty. We cannot continue as if
countries and populations around the world are disconnected and we must make changes to ways of travelling and

transporting things that stop burning combustible fuels. It is important that countries like New Zealand use their
capacity for technological innovation to strive for non-burning energy sources for future modes and systems of a
more sustainable mobility without carbon.

2050 target


Q1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

The Zero Carbon Act should set a 2050 target in law. Policy makers should work carefully on various strategies for
reaching different "publics" with different needs and values to translate the realities of such legislation. Setting

law now gives us time to work out multiple modes of implementing a target by 2050.

Q2. Which is the best 2050 target for New Zealand?


Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases, short-lived and long-lived.

The other options suggested, like merely aiming to stabilise short-lived gases or ignoring them altogether, would
undercut the 'zero' part of the Zero Carbon Act and risk international criticism. I believe we need to adapt now to
living with a personal commitment and national commitment of zero GHG emissions.


Q3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

By cutting emissions here (including by planting more forests) in New Zealand, not by buying overseas credits. I do
not believe in buying credits from elsewhere so that industries can continue to burn carbon here.


Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

Not unless we bring it closer.


Emissions budgets

Q5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be
in place at any given time. Do you agree with this proposal?


Yes.

Q6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?


No. Emissions budgets should be only be changed due to major changes in scientific understanding, not political or
economic developments.

Q7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific
range under exceptional circumstances?


No.

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed considerations that the Government and the Climate Commission will need to
take into account when advising on and setting budgets?


Yes, I agree that they will need to consider:
- scientific knowledge (especially New Zealand-specific) regarding climate change
- technology relevant to climate change
- social circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel poverty

- energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy supplies and the carbon and energy intensity of the
economy
- economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the economy, as well as the competitiveness of
particular sectors of the economy
- fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on taxation, public spending and public borrowing
- residential circumstances and assisting those who wish to move out of coastal floodplains; this should not become
a personal burden resulting in loss of property or residential housing


Government response

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the

emissions budgets?

Yes, the Act should set fixed deadlines to focus attention to these budget commitments.

Q10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For

example, who do we need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

In setting plans to meet the emissions budgets, the government should be:
- consulting tangata whenua now and throughout until 2050
- making sure budgets are based on New Zealand science and ethnographic accounts of anticipated impacts

- ensuring that emissions budgets deliver fair outcomes for Kiwis = climate justice
- reflecting the principle of a Just Transition for workers
- honouring Te Tiriti o Waitangi
- being environmentally sustainable, especially for New Zealand's unique native plants and animals
- maximising the impact of money spent and being cost-effective

- encouraging innovation
- unlocking economic opportunities for New Zealanders, such as in renewable energy
- honouring our international commitments, including under the Paris Agreement
- consulting people who may be economically affected, like farmers or businesses

- consulting young people, who'll live to see more of the impact of climate change
- consulting communities already facing the physical impacts of climate change
- reporting back to those communities and "publics" on a regular basis
- evaluating the effects of emissions budgets regularly and openly


Climate Change Commission

Q11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's
progress towards its goals. Do you agree with these functions?


Yes, I do. The Commission should provide expert independent advice, but not be a decision-maker. I would like to
see Climate Commission advice and monitoring comments provided in video with closed captions, signed in NZSL
and in te reo. Not just written reports.

Q12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions

Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)? (Should it provide advice, or make decisions too?)

The Commission should advise the government on policy around the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme.

Q13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and

desirable expertise. Do you agree with the proposed expertise?

I agree that members of the Climate Commission should have expertise in:


- climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
- climate change policy (including emissions trading)
- te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori (Māori language, culture, and philosophy) and Māori interests
- knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology development system
- risk management

- resource economics and impacts (including labour markets and distribution)
- experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning, insurance and local government
- engineering and/or infrastructure
- community engagement and communications
- business competitiveness


In addition, they should have expertise in:
- expertise in public health
- understanding of our international commitments, including under the Paris Agreement
- understanding of the social impacts of climate change and/or government policy

- knowledge of principles of equity and a Just Transition

Adapting to the impact of climate change


Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Yes. There might need to be a separate adaptation sub-committee of the Commission, but it is important that our
everyday lives and weather experiences are linked to lowering emissions on all levels of society.


Q15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree
with the proposed functions?

Yes, the Zero Carbon Act should require:


- a national climate change risk assessment
- a national adaptation plan
- regular reviews of progress towards implementing the national adaptation plan

- an adaptation reporting power

Care will need to be taken in managing the interaction between national and local government roles. But national
government cannot just sit back and manage regional and local action. National government must remain active,
flexible and relevant while engaging "publics" in committing to an all-country adaptation plan.


Q16. Should the Government explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some
organisations share information on their exposure to climate change risks?

Yes. This would let the government and the public know about the risks to public and other infrastructure, and

make these organisations better informed about the risks they face.

An extra point to consider - climate finance

The Zero Carbon Act should also provide a framework for transparency and accountability around New Zealand's

international climate finance in recognition that the Pacific is a region joined by the sea and the weather, not
separated into a number of island nations. Many, many New Zealanders want to work collectively with our Pacific
neighbours.


Conclusion

Thank you for the chance to submit on the Zero Carbon Bill. This is truly the issue of this generation that affects
everyone no matter their social, cultural or geographical location. We must all become involved equally.


Yours sincerely,

Martha G. Bell (Dr)
