Subject: Please do not destroy our economy and undermine our living standards
I do not agree at all with spending any money on mitigating so-called global warming or climate change effects.
This is not settled science for one thing, and for another, NZ is so small and so green that nothing we can do will
make any significant difference to the world. All that will happen is that we will penalize ourselves and our own

economy, and create even more poverty in our country.
To try to target carbon dioxide and other gases will only create a huge bureaucracy as we try to create plans to
meet targets and then monitor them. And all for something that scientists disagree on. It is a gravy train for those
who like to push the climate change model, but these are only models and they have been proved to be very wrong

in the past.
I believe that no gases should be included in emissions targets because I do not want to see businesses and jobs
destroyed, and the economy brought down. If I thought that it might actually do some good I would consider it, but
there is no hard evidence that it will do any good for the environment at all.

Regards,
Hilary Beath
