Subject: Opposition to the Zero Carbon Bill
Hello
Please accept this as my objection to the proposed Zero Carbon Bill. It is ineffective and unsupportable for the following reasons:
     The Zero Carbon Bill will create a vast bureaucracy: A Climate Change Commission, ‘emissions budgets’, climate change

       adaptation plans, and emissions targets.

     While most methane in New Zealand is produced by ruminants digesting food, it is not the problem the activists are
       making it out to be. Soil scientist, Dr Doug Edmeades, explains that since livestock are carbon neutral, methane from
       agriculture should not be included in emissions targets.


     In fact, no gases should be included in emissions targets, because just like the Emissions Trading Scheme, James Shaw’s
       proposed Zero Carbon Bill will create a costly nightmare of red tape and bureaucracy that will waste time and money,
       drag down the economy, and destroy businesses and jobs – without having any impact at all on the climate. The Zero
       Carbon Bill should be suspended - indefinitely!
