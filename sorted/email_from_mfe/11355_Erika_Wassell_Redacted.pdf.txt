Dear Sir or Madam,


Thank you for the opportunity to have a say on the proposed Zero Carbon Bill. I am writing in support of vulnerable communities in
developing countries, including in the Pacific, for whom dealing with the impacts of climate change is already a daily reality. I believe
we have a responsibility to support these communities to adapt to their changing climate and break free from poverty. As such, I ask

that the Zero Carbon Bill become a tool to strengthen our climate assistance to developing countries. Specifically, I encourage you to:
  1.  Include strong language in the Bill on our commitments to developing countries, as per Paris Agreement and the Sustainable
     Development Goals, particularly in the area of adaptation;
  2.  Set up a process, as part of the proposed Climate Change Commission, to ensure greater transparency and impact of our

     current and future climate finance to developing countries

Yours sincerely,


Erika
