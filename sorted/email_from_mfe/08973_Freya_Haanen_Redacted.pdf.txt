Dear Madam / Sir

                            Submission on the Zero Carbon Bill from Freya Haanen

This is our chance. I'm excited to be submitting on the Zero Carbon Bill because I'm happy that New Zealand is
finally taking action on climate change, and making a plan to decrease carbon emissions!


2050 target

Q1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation? (In legislation
now, or later via the Climate Commission?)


We should set a 2050 target now, in legislation.

Q2. Which is the best 2050 target for New Zealand? (Which emissions should be covered and how?)


Zero, zero, zero! net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases. We need to aim for the best possible outcome.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its targets? (Within New Zealand, or with international trading too?)

I'm not sure I understand how other countries are relevant to this discussion when we're talking about how New

Zealand can reduce emissions. There are carbon zero solutions out there for many things, and we can start by
making a shift to those. Getting rid of cremation, for example, and replacing it with cryomation or a version of that.
Or encouraging natural, no embalming, burials (embalming isn't good for our environment) instead of cremation.


Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

I wouldn't want future governments to cop out like national did with swimmable rivers, where they just changed
the definition of swimmable. I want to be proud of my government, not ashamed.


The 2050 target should not be able to be weakened, but only strengthened. This 'no backsliding' approach is
consistent with the spirit of the Paris Agreement.

Emissions budgets


Q5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be
in place at any given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

Yes. Emissions budgets under the Zero Carbon Act should cover five year periods and be set three budgets in
advance. This will provide long-term certainty.


Q6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

No. Emissions budgets should be only be changed due to major changes in scientific understanding, not political or
economic developments. The same 'no backsliding' principle should apply as for the 2050 target.


Q7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific
range under exceptional circumstances?


No, for the same reasons as in my answer to Q6.

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed considerations that the Government and the Climate Commission will need to
take into account when advising on and setting budgets?


Yes, I agree that they will need to consider:
- scientific knowledge regarding climate change
- technology relevant to climate change
- social circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel poverty
- energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy supplies and the carbon and energy intensity of the

economy
- economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the economy, as well as the competitiveness of
particular sectors of the economy
- fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on taxation, public spending and public borrowing


Government response

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the
emissions budgets?
Yes, the Act should set fixed deadlines, so we don't repeat the mistakes of the UK Climate Change Act 2008, which
didn't include deadlines for making these plans.


Q10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For
example, who do we need to work with, what else needs to be considered?


In setting plans to meet the emissions budgets, the government should be:
- making sure they're based on the best science available
- ensuring that they deliver fair outcomes for Kiwis
- reflecting the principle of a Just Transition for workers
- honouring Te Tiriti o Waitangi

- being environmentally sustainable, especially for New Zealand's unique native plants and animals
- maximising the impact of money spent and being cost-effective
- encouraging innovation
- unlocking economic opportunities for New Zealanders, such as in renewable energy
- honouring our international commitments, including under the Paris Agreement

- consulting people who may be economically affected, like farmers or businesses
- consulting tangata whenua
- consulting young people, who'll live to see more of the impact of climate change
- consulting communities already facing the physical impacts of climate change


Climate Change Commission

Q11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's
progress towards its goals. Do you agree with these functions?


Yes, I do. The Commission should provide expert independent advice, but not be a decision-maker.

Q12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)? (Should it provide advice, or make decisions too?)


The Commission should advise the government on policy around the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme.

Q13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and
desirable expertise. Do you agree with the proposed expertise?


I agree that members of the Climate Commission should have expertise in:

- climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
- climate change policy (including emissions trading)

- te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori (Māori language, culture, and philosophy) and Māori interests
- knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology development system
- risk management
- resource economics and impacts (including labour markets and distribution)
- experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning, insurance and local government

- engineering and/or infrastructure
- community engagement and communications
- business competitiveness


In addition, they should have expertise in:
- expertise in public health
- understanding of our international commitments, including under the Paris Agreement
- understanding of the social impacts of climate change and/or government policy
- knowledge of principles of equity and a Just Transition


Adapting to the impact of climate change

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?


Yes. There might need to be a separate adaptation sub-committee of the Commission, as in the UK.

Q15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree
with the proposed functions?


Yes, the Zero Carbon Act should require:

- a national climate change risk assessment
- a national adaptation plan

- regular reviews of progress towards implementing the national adaptation plan
- an adaptation reporting power

Care will need to be taken in managing the interaction between national and local government roles.


Q16. Should the Government explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some
organisations share information on their exposure to climate change risks?

Yes. This would let the government and the public know about the risks to public and other infrastructure, and

make these organisations better informed about the risks they face.

An extra point to consider - climate finance


The Zero Carbon Act should also provide a framework for transparency and accountability around New Zealand's
international climate finance.

Conclusion


Thanks for taking the time to read this, if you have. I know after the first few questions I took the WWF answers but
I do agree with them wholeheartedly. Thanks for letting me have my say :)

Yours faithfully


Freya Haanen
