Disappointing to see your figure of agriculture emissions contributing 49% to greenhouse gases still being quoted. You must

specifically quantify this to be credible. Ruminant animals cannot ‘create’ carbon. All the carbon content of gas emitted has already
been captured from the atmosphere by photosynthesis . This must be credited if the emission is a debit . Animal dung is 30% carbon
,immediately returned to the soil , and there is a small credit in carbon stored in bones, hide and wool. The dreaded Methane , as
shown in an excellent paper by Oxford University , is, over 10 years converted back to CO2 in the troposphere , completing the cycle

as it has for millions of years. If you intend to tax Methane ,then to be consistent you will need to include all the wetlands. Basically do
you recognize any credit for the grasslands capture of CO2?
