Dear Minister, I support the passing of legally binding climate law. It will be in the interests of everyone in the long

term. NZ needs to protect its reputation for pioneering sustainable living, and it needs a great story or two to
bolster the 100% Pure NZ global image. Cheers, and congratulations so far. Nick Yours sincerely, Nick Worthington
