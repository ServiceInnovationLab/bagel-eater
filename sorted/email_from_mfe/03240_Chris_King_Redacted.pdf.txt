Dear Minister, I support the passing of legally binding climate law. The inability of the people of the Earth to

address climate change, habitat destruction and the loss of genetic and biological diversity is a principal threat to
human survival and the survival of the diversity of the biosphere. Central to addressing this effectively and
constructively is developing renewable energy and controlling the profligate use of carbon as a fuel. The only way
we can ensure humanity can survive is to develop a zero CO2 accounting over the intermediate and long term.

Ultimately this is the only economic way forward and will help lead the world as a whole to survival. Yours sincerely,
Chris King
