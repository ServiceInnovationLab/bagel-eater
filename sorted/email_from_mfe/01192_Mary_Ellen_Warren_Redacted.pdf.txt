Subject: Our Climate Your say
Please could you acknowledge receipt of this message. Thank you.
Thank you for taking the time to come to the regions with your information on the Zero Carbon Bill.
I support the vision that climate change is our nuclear free moment and support New Zealand setting substantial targets. Beyond

that I urge New Zealand to work on a global cap and trade solution.
I support a commission of independent advisors (beyond stakeholders) The role of the Environmental Commissioner provides an
example of the benefits of independent advice. However, I would support a with a high level of authority for the Climate Commission .
I strongly support a clear plan to assess and adapt to the risks of climate change. Part of this plan should be determining the risks

with respect to government functions (transport agriculture forestry). The plan should also communicate the risks (education) with
the public.
I endorse a Net Zero Emissions target. I feel this strong effort will result in a positive image of New Zealand that will have benefits as
consumers around the world search out sustainable and ethical products and services.
