Dear Minister, I support the passing of legally binding climate law. The law must be fair, ambitious and consistent

with the climate science and international frameworks by including all gases and all sectors. I support all
greenhouse gases being included in the law, consistent with international climate frameworks. The
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change makes it clear that methane reduction is critical to success in tackling
climate change. It is politically and scientifically untenable for New Zealand’s climate law to exclude any gases from

our biggest emitting sector - the agricultural sector. I support the ‘firewall’ principle, that New Zealand’s targets
must be achieved by actual cuts in our own emissions, and not through the purchase of overseas carbon credits or
an over-reliance on forests as carbon sinks Yours sincerely, Chris Rodliffe
