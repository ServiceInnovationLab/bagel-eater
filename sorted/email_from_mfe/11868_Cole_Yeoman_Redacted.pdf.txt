Dear Sir or Madam,


Firstly, thank you for the chance to share my thoughts as input to the proposed Zero Carbon Bill. I am writing in
support of vulnerable communities in developing countries, including in the Pacific, who are already dealing with
the impacts of climate change as their daily reality. I believe we have a responsibility to support these communities
to adapt to their changing climate and end the resultant cycle of poverty. So I ask that the Zero Carbon Bill become

a tool to strengthen our climate assistance to developing countries. Specifically, I encourage you to:

  1.  Include strong language in the Bill on our commitments to developing countries, as per Paris Agreement and
     the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly in the area of adaptation;
  2.  Set up a process, as part of the proposed Climate Change Commission, to ensure greater transparency and
     impact of our current and future climate finance to developing countries.


NgƒÅ mihi,

Cole Yeoman
