Submissions Subject: Submission on the Zero Carbon Bill Dear Minister, The zero carbon act needs to be properly
thought out and backed by substantiated science - not hypothetical theories. The big picture must be taken into
account - if hydrocarbons are to be replaced what is the total environmental footprint of the alternatives, taking
into consideration the manufacture, and recycling/disposal of the alternatives. The alternatives need to be

available and effective before hydrocarbons can be replaced. Solar and wind power will take time and investment
before they can replace todays fuels. A feel good act will achieve little if it is not practical and affordable. Yours
sincerely, David Henry
