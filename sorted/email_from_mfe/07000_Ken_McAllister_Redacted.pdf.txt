Dear Minister, The legislation should limit warming to 1.5 degrees.Two degrees would lock in devastating impacts

on Pacific Island states and cause significant extinctions. That is not acceptable. There must be rapid cuts in all
greenhouse gases beginning now. I support a net-zero target of 2040 with the majority of cuts occurring over the
next decade. Methane reduction is critical to success in tackling climate change. It is politically and scientifically
untenable for New Zealandâ€™s climate law to exclude any gases from our biggest emitting sector - the agricultural

sector. Climate change is the greatest challenge facing humanity. It would be wrong to have broad agreement on
weak law, when what is urgently needed to address the problem is strong law. New Zealand must be bold and pass
strong law for the sake of our precious earth and future generations. Yours sincerely, Ken McAllister
