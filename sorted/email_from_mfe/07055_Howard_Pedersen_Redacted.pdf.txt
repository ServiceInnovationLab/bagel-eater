Dear Minister, I do not support the passing of legally binding climate law. It's time to consult someone who actually

understands climate change and doesn't just jump on the trendy CO2 hobby horse. I'm happy to discuss with you
why limiting CO2 will have no impact on climate. There are other important aspects of global warming such as
mitigation of effects. I have researched Climate change for 30 years as well as working in the field for 12 years so I
do have some knowledge of the issues. Yours sincerely, Howard Pedersen
