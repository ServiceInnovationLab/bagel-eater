   Â· No Thanks, I have not received any real proof or data to prove climate change is caused by mans activities. Climate is always changing and it will in the future. We receive a lot of proper gander
       from the worlds media and so called scientist who have much to gain, the media never reports that there as been a petition signed by 31,000.00 scientists from around the world, stating
       climate change as nothing to do with mans activities or CO2 rise, CO2 creates more life, more food, and makes the world greener.


Please feel free to send me your data proving climate change is man made.



       Only a couple of years ago, its was found the climate models these scientists have been using had been tamped with and the true data had not been published. This falsehood as corporate
       greed all over it. Please wise up and do your own research.


       Regards

       Paul Green
