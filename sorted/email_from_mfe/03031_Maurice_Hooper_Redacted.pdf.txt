Subject: The Zero Carbon Bill.
To: whom it may concern:
I write to express my deep concerns relating to the proposed government Carbon Bill.
I am an older NZer who has always been interested in our environment, spending the first 22 years of my life

working on the land and studying agriculture.
Since then I have worked in and with earth based industries, very much effected by weather and climate
conditions.
I have followed and studied with interest the political and scientific publications and policies that

surround "Climate Change"
I am becoming increasingly aware that to: ESTABLISH COSTLY POLICIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING DRIVEN BY
THE GREEN PARTY WITH AN IDEOLOGY THAT IS EMOTIVE AND FEAR BASED RATHER THAN - "SETTLED
SCIENCE."

IT NEEDS TO BE STOPPED NOW.
