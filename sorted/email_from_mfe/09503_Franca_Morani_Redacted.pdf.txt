I endorse the position of the Green Party, as well as Greenpeace regarding the Zero carbon bill, but think the bill

should aim for zero emissions by 2040.










     The Government should set a 2040 target of net zero emissions in legislation now.
     Net zero emissions goal should be across all greenhouse gases (including CO2 and methane).




     Support the Government’s proposal for there to be emissions budgets that set out the pathway over a 5-year
     period.




     The Bill should require Governments to set out how it will achieve the emissions budgets, including transition

     pathways




     The Commission should advise the government on targets and policy planning. The Government should have
     to publicly respond to, and provide rationale when it deviates from the Commission’s advice. The Climate
     Commission should also act as an independent watchdog, publishing progress reports and highlighting

     problems.




     The Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to the impacts of climate change.

     This should involve the Government setting a National Adaptation Plan that sets a clear direction to local

     government and helps co-ordinate the response across different sectors and including iwi and hapū.

Sincerely

Franca Morani
