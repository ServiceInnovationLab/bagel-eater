Dear Minister, I strongly support the proposed zero carbon act. The law must be fair, ambitious and consistent with

the climate science and international frameworks. The legislation should aim for the key goal of limiting warming to
1.5 degrees. As a art of this, I support rapid cuts in all greenhouse gases beginning now to achieve a a net-zero
target of 2040. I support all greenhouse gases being included in the law, consistent with international climate
frameworks. a Climate Commission to devise binding budgets is a very good approach. While budgets should be

binding, policy recommendations from the Commission should be just that - recommendations. Finally, I support the
‘firewall’ principle, that New Zealand’s targets must be achieved by actual cuts in our own emissions, and not
through the purchase of overseas carbon credits or an over-reliance on forests as carbon sinks Yours sincerely,
Alistair Gunn
