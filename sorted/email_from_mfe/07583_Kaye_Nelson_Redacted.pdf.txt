I would like to submit the following points to be considered for the Zero carbon bill. 1.That Govt. considers

supplying funds to firms to recycle our waste. eg plastic ,paper rubber etc. research and developement should be
done so these materials become a commodity and not a waste product. 2.Emission Trading scheme. Be altered so
that the allocation of NZU for the native forest on private land be allocated to the owners of that land who at the
moment pay the rates and insurance and any other costs for no benefit to their businesses. Kaye Nelson .
