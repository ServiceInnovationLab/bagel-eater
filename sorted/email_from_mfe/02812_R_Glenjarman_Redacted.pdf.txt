Together we have a choice. As a nation, we can either allow our natural resources to be consumed at such a rate

that we bankrupt our own environmental future, or we can take responsibility for management and sustainability
of our finite resources. We, as citizens, know that our drinking water is becoming more and more polluted, just like
our air. We, as people of New Zealand, know that the issues we have now are caused by the actions of people 50
years in the past. Therefore our current actions are influencing our children and grandchildrens futures. We

should be looking 50 years into the future in order to preserve the quality of life New Zealand has to offer. If you
want a future worth living in, where the beaches are clean, the air is breathable and children dont whither and die
inside their mothers from nitrate poisoning in the water (blue baby syndrome) then YOU must take control of the
future of our environment NOW, before we loose the ability to mitigate the consequences of actions we made for
financial gain. You are in control of your future as well as ours. The people of New Zealand know that gdp might be

important to you at the government level, but most kiwis consider themselves rich for the ability to go out and
enjoy the beauty we still have. If you dont think we have it good, and you dont think we must act NOW, then i
EMPLORE you to please travel to places such as south-east asia and other developing nations. Where i witnessed
first hand governments selling the future of it's children to palm oil companies. Remember, you are a public figure.
Do you not worry that your name will be on the list of the people who sat by and did nothing while our ability

maintain our nation rotted away? How bad can carbon neutral really be? Yours sincerely, R Glenjarman
