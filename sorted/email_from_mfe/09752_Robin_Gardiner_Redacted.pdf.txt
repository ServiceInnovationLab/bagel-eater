Subject: Zero Carbon Bill
To Whom it may concern
I TOTALLY disagree with any attempt by the Government to control our climate

The climate is changing and all thinking people will agree with that but what we are talking about here is not Climate Change but MAN
MADE GLOBAL WARMING for which there is no irrefutable evidence
New Zealandâ€™s contribution to the increase in CO2 on a worldwide basis is miniscule and the proposed Climate Commission with its
attendant bureaucracy will impose nearly impossible compliant costs and reduce the value of the New Zealand economy massively

for ABSOLUTLEY NO BENEFIT
CO2 is not a pollutant as it is necessary for the existence of all life on this planet
In the last thirty years the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased significantly but the average Global Temperature has not

and I heard today that the temperature has in fact dropped over the last few years by nearly one degree Fahrenheit So is CO2 the
evil gas that it is portrayed to be or is it not
Also the variances that have been put forward to support the hypothesis of Global Warming are not extremes but are still within the
Statistical Norms

One of the claims is that the agriculture sector with its Methane Excretions is a major contributor to Global Warming It is not. The
animal husbandry sector is effectively carbon neutral Methane is not long lived in the atmosphere, returns to carbon which the plants
need to grow so that the animals can eat
The costs of this ill-conceived Bill will be horrendous and will damage the economy of New Zealand immensely for no benefit I believe

that nothing should be attempted other than to protect our trading with the rest of the world and should the worst occur we are an
adaptable species and we will adapt at a much lessor cost overall
THIS BILL SHOULD NOT PROCEED
