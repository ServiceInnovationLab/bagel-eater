Subject: MY SUBMISSION RE CLIMATE CHANGE.

Sir,

The climate has and always will vary. There have been periods when the presence of carbon in the atmosphere was

considerably more than it is today. There have also been periods when the average temperature has been considerably higher
than the current level. These periods resulted in no disaster of any kind.

The claimed 'consensus' regarding climate change is non-existent - there are very many eminent scientists in various fields
who are opposed to the views of the dogmatic frenzy and ludicrous claims of the anti carbon levy.


The contribution of New Zealand to global carbon emissions are so low as to be totally insignificant.

The suggestion that we should cripple our economy with restrictive measures which would have virtually no effect is the
height of stupidity.

I therefore believe that all these suggested measures be abandoned and we should withdraw from all agreements and

conferences involving climate change.

Ronald Berrington
