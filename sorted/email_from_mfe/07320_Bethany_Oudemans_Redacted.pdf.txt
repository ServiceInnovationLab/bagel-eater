Dear Minister, We really need to stop using plastic. Have you seen what it has done to our oceans so far? Did you

know that in 2050 there will be more plastics in the ocean then fish? We really to stop this problem because if we
don't when we are older we won't be able to look at the ocean without seeing plastic. If we ban plastic shopping
bags that will help so much, because turtles and whales eat plastics bags because they think that they are squid,
so when they eat lots of plastic bags it clogs up their stomachs and then they die because they can't eat. You are

probably are wondering right now what can little old New Zealand do. Well if other countries see New Zealand
banning plastic bags then they might too. Then there will be no more plastic bags in the world. I believe that we
can make this happen. Yours sincerely, Bethany Oudemans
