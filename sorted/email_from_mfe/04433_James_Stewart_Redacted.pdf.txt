Dear Minister, I support the passing of legally binding climate law. Climate change is the greatest challenge facing

humanity. It would be wrong to have broad agreement on weak law, when what is urgently needed to address the
problem is strong law. The world needs pathways to transformational change if we are to avoid catastrophic
warming. This is the scale of the challenge. The science is clear: the only way we can succeed is with big ambition.
New Zealand must be bold and pass strong law for the sake of our precious earth and future generations. Yours

sincerely, James Stewart
