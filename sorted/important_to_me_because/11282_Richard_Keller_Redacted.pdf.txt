A Zero Carbon Act is important to me           It's getting late in the action period. Yes, it's been 40 years since we
because...                                     in the West have become aware of where this was heading. Granted,
                                               since then facts have sharpened and understandings have become

                                               clearer, but there was opportunity to understand and get started on
                                               this globally 40 years ago but there has been a lot of obfuscation to
                                               prevent this beginning. All the more reason a hard structure and
                                               specific undertakings must be put into legislation. Otherwise there
                                               are those who would still want to stall. And that desperation may still

                                               win out. Or not.

Q1. What process should the                    The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now. Let's
Government use to set a new emissions          make that 2040 so as to give less time to find excuses (further
reduction target in legislation?               obfuscations).

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050              Before we get too excited here, it must be said again that we need
target now, which is the best target for       more than just TARGETS (arrgh)! We need action.
New Zealand?                                   The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
                                               zero by 2050 (2040). I also support taking a science-based approach

                                               to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as
                                               possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while
                                               reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels with continual
                                               evaluation of what 'sustainable levels' are for this context.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its            The Emissions Trading Scheme has been a failure. In fact it has been

                                               By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
                                               forest planting).

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow          The 2050 (2040) target should not be altered in response to
the 2050 target to be revised if               “economic changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty.

circumstances change?                          Given the long term costs of climate change, "economic changes"
                                               would be just another desperate obfuscation. However, the ability to
                                               revise the 2050 (2040) target in light of natural disasters, major

take into account when advising on and
setting budgets?                              I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should
                                              take the following factors into consideration when advising on and
                                              setting budgets:

                                              • scientific knowledge regarding climate change
                                              • technology relevant to climate change
                                              • economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the
                                              economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the
                                              economy

                                              • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on
                                              taxation, public spending and public borrowing
                                              • social circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel

Q10. What are the most important              The plans must be made with the understanding that there has been
issues for the Government to consider         much obfuscation over 40 years and that baggage must be dropped

in setting plans to meet budgets? For         before the scale and depth of plans required can be grasp.

                                              reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.

Q11. The Government has proposed that While a Commission with decision-making powers might be possible,
the Climate Change Commission advises politicians must be the ones communicating with, and held

on and monitors New Zealand's                 accountable by, the public. Therefore, the Commission should

agree with these functions?                   should be legally required to consider and formally respond to the

                                              act on it.
                                              Yes - monitoring must be of the highest scientific and technical

                                              standard so that political and moral thinking can be correctly
                                              informed.

                                              I agree with the following collective expertise:

                                              • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
                                              • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour

                                              • engineering and/or infrastructure

                                              • community engagement and communications
                                              Also, public health.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill        Yes. Adaptation strategies and projects will likely be at the top of the

                                              them both in mind.

                                              This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within the
                                              Climate Commission, however.

with the proposed functions?                  I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance
                                              is required in terms of how local councils are involved:
                                              • a national climate change risk assessment
                                              • a national adaptation plan

                                              • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                              adaptation plan
                                              • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation
reporting power that could see some           Yes
organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?

                                              can be overcome.

                                              gasses can have a huge effect on our climate and need to be
