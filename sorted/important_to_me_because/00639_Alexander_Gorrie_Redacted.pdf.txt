A Zero Carbon Act is important to me         If we don't set ambitious carbon emissions targets, the world is going

                                             environmental problem, we are facing a myriad of social and ethical

                                             injustices if we sit back and continue to operate as usual. It concerns

                                             how much biodiversity we stand to lose if inadequate action is taken.

                                             we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                             short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its          By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new

Q5. The Government proposes that

each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be    yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that

with this proposal?

                                             supplies and the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require      Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change
Governments to set out plans within a
certain timeframe to achieve the             Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan and
emissions budgets?                           producing outcomes.
Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider        The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be

what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that        The Commission should reflect what is best for the climate and as an
the Climate Change Commission advises
on and monitors New Zealand's                independent entity from the Government, should have the power to

                                             emissions targets.
agree with these functions?

Q12. What role do you think the Climate      The Commission should tighten the emissions trading scheme so

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:

Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (excluding the current emissions trading

                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

exposure to climate change risks?

Further comments                             How are we currently incentivising lower emissions activities such as
                                             - promoting communal transport (free or heavily subsidised)
                                             - bicycle usage
                                             - electric bus uptake
                                             - converting old vehicles to electric (in doing so promoting skilled,
