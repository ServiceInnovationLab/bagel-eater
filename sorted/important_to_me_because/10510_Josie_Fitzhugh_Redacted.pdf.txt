A Zero Carbon Act is important to me         We need a firm commitment and a roadmap to change our
because...                                   relationship to the environment. The sooner we get this underway,
                                             the more chance we have to enhance our environment for this

                                             action sooner and more decisively. I also support taking a science-

                                             based approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as
                                             impactful as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived
                                             gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its          By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                     forest planting).

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow        The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic

                                             the focus should be on bringing targets closer rather than on
                                             delaying.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years        yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be 3 are in effect at all times. Continuity outside of the political cycle is

in place at any given time. Do you agree essential
with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to

                                             However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                             scientific understanding or international agreements should be

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

Q11. The Government has proposed that Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)

have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important and people

                                             competent in understanding evidence / data within a policy context.
                                             Having the ability to take different lenses to the issues, and not hold
                                             a fixed perspective, is critical. Creative thinking is essential for
                                             change

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill       Yes. There should be a separate sub-committee within the Climate
should cover adapting to climate             Commission for this along with a highly skilled team of
change?                                      communications / change professionals.

Q15. The Government has proposed a           I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance

with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan
                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                             adaptation plan

                                             • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation
reporting power that could see some          Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Further comments                             Let's be bold with our commitment to change New Zealand. We can,
                                             and should, take this on with clear structures, strong levels of

                                             accountability, and a determination to act not just pay lip-service. It
                                             is time for us to take responsibility (both collectively and
                                             individually).
