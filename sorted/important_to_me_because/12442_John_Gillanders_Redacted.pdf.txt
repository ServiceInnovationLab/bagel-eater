A Zero Carbon Act is important to me           I want our daughter to have a world to grow up in that is peaceful
because...                                     and liveable.
                                               Other people (particularly those less fortunate than us) and the

                                               animals we share this planet with deserve a future with a liveable
                                               planet.
                                               Our economy also depends on us moving into true sustainability (not
                                               the pseudo-sustainability that is currently being promoted by many,
                                               often because of corporate interest).

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050              The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net

New Zealand?                                   ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                               we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while
                                               drastically reducing short-lived gas emissions in the short and long

                                               term. Transition of our agricultural system to plant-based, away from
                                               animal-based is key for this goal, and this transition will have the
                                               huge added benefits of being much better for our own wellbeing &
                                               human health by drastically improving healthy living and reducing
                                               our biggest chronic diseases, and to reduce harm and suffering of

                                               animals - wild and farmed. It will also be critical to our economy,
                                               since plant-based agriculture is massively more efficient than
                                               animal-based agriculture.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its            By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                       native forest planting). By incentivising a complete shift from animal-
                                               based agriculture systems to plant-based systems including using

                                               new food technologies to give people the familiar tastes of animal
                                               products that most people know and love. Example: supporting NZ-
                                               based companies like Sunfed Meats, Alternative Meat Co and Angel
                                               Foods. Also incentivising and dramatically subsidising the production
                                               of increased consumption of whole plant foods (also promotes health

                                               and saves dramatically on healthcase costs, freeing up significant
                                               funds to be used for greenhouse gas emission target initiatives).
                                               Animal-based agriculture is responsible for the bulk of our
                                               greenhouse gas emissions, so that is the most important target area
                                               to begin with. Transition to clean energy sources and transport

                                               fleets, especially planning for self-driving electric vehicles, is also
                                               important but significantly less so than animal agriculture.

                                              I suggest having a separate adaptation sub-committee within the
