                                             we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                             short-lived gases to sustainable levels. Stopping oil and gas

                                             Local governments and businesses need to have reasonable
                                             certainty in order to plan. However, the ability to revise budgets in

                                             permitted.
Q8. Do you agree with the proposed            I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

                                              groups whose current jobs are going to be phased out, for instance in

                                              north island. Some industries will need to think widely and change

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require
Governments to set out plans within a         Yes - we need a strict time frame as soon as possible

Q11. The Government has proposed that Probably the Commission should not be a decision-making body.

                                              Everybody needs to be committed to achieving the goals, setting
                                              local ways of meeting goals. Regular feedback also important with

                                              appropriate pats on the back. Good communications with the media
                                              is also important: the media can be very obstructive if not on board.

                                              I think expertise in public health is also important.

                                              • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation

reporting power that could see some           Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

                                              can be done, think of the war where people worked together because
