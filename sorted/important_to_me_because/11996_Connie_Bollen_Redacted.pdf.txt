A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          The current framework for tackling climate change in New Zealand is
because...                                    ineffective and not robust enough to cope with future challenges. We
                                              need to have a plan to reduce our emissions, targets and be

                                              accountable to them. What scares me most about climate change is
                                              the fact the full impacts of changing weather patterns are not known.
                                              I think the zero carbon act bill gives an opportunity for certainty in a
                                              pretty uncertain future. I’m also hopeful that such an Act will lead to
                                              increased education in NZ around climate issues.

Q1. What process should the

reduction target in legislation?

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for      zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                  ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This would accommodate the

                                              current make up of the New Zealand economy and allow for just
                                              transitioning.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                      forest planting). Relying on international credits has undermined the
                                              credibility of our emissions trading scheme and should therefore be
                                              revised.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic

the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                         ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                              understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be     Yes. I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
in place at any given time. Do you agree      3 are in effect at all times.

with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to

                                              However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                              scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                              permitted. This should be done based on the recommendation of the

                                              independent climate committee.

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed            I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

the Climate Commission will need to           setting budgets:

                                              • economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the
                                              economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the
                                              economy
                                              • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on
                                              taxation, public spending and public borrowing

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require
Governments to set out plans within a        Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change
                                             Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan. It is
certain timeframe to achieve the             important to have certainty in the Act for all industry players.
emissions budgets?

Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider        The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
in setting plans to meet budgets? For        comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and
example, who do we need to work with,        reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that
                                             Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.
the Climate Change Commission advises        However, the Government should be legally required to consider and
on and monitors New Zealand's                formally respond to the Commission’s advice, and to provide an
progress towards its goals. Do you
agree with these functions?                  explanation if they do not act on it.

Q12. What role do you think the Climate
Change Commission should have in             The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in
                                             the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to the
relation to the New Zealand Emissions        number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests

                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori

                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                             • experts in public health
                                             • community engagement and communications.

                                             development system.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill       Yes. Having only mitigation provisions in the Act is not sufficient.
should cover adapting to climate             New Zealand needs to start adapting to predicted changes before it
change?                                      becomes to costly to do so. This may require a separate adaptation
                                             sub-committee within the Climate Commission.

Q15. The Government has proposed a           I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance
number of new functions to help us           is required in terms of how local councils are involved:

adapt to climate change. Do you agree        • a national climate change risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan
                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                             adaptation plan
                                             • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation

reporting power that could see some          Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Further comments                             I am a young(ish) kiwi and am thrilled that the government has
                                             recognised that we need to have a solid plan for reducing our
                                             emissions. It is one of our best means to combat climate change.
