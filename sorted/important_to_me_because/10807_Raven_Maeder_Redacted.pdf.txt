A Zero Carbon Act is important to me           A Zero Carbon Bill is important to me because we need to have an
because...                                     over-arching, long-term framework for taking major and meaningful
                                               action on both mitigation and adaptation to climate change, in order

                                               to minimise the detrimental impacts that it will have on our
                                               communities, communities around the world, future generations and
                                               all life that we share this planet with. This is important to me
                                               because I hope to one day have children, and I will only feel morally
                                               capable of doing that if I believe that they will inherit a liveable

                                               future. I want my children to have the opportunity to grow up
                                               enjoying beautiful New Zealand nature as I did - to be able to go
                                               hiking in our national parks, to swim in healthy oceans and rivers and
                                               to have a stable climate and hope for the future. I do not want my
                                               children to live in a world where they have inherited the economic

                                               and social cost of regular natural disasters, an unstable climate,
                                               resource wars, climate refugees and where they face fear and
                                               uncertainty about the future. I do not want my generation, or indeed
                                               my children’s generation to face the cost of our inaction – I want
                                               them to inherit the opportunity of our foresightedness.


                                               The opportunity that the Zero Carbon Bill presents is less uncertainty
                                               about the future through having a plan in place for sustainable
                                               development and parameters that our politicians must work within,
                                               which will mean that businesses and communities can develop

                                               accordingly. This gives us as a nation an opportunity to have a real
                                               conversation about the kind of country we want to be and to develop
                                               in a way that is future-thinking, socially and environmentally
                                               sustainable, innovative and just to future generations.


                                               The prospect of an effective Zero Carbon Act gives me a lot more
                                               hope for the future. My generation is faced with a lot of uncertainty
                                               about what the future holds and what the state of the world will be.
                                               This bill actually gives me a feeling of inspiration for the what our
                                               future could be like, and a tentative sense of security that we may

                                               have a plan on how we're going to get there.

                                               emissions are as impactful as possible: we should aim for negative

                                               levels of long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases to
                                               sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its            By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                       forest planting).

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow          The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic

                                               However, it is important that the target has long-term certainty
                                               otherwise its purpose is defeated.
Q5. The Government proposes that

                                              otherwise their purpose is defeated.

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:

have a range of essential and desirable        • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour

                                               • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology
                                               development system.


                                               It is important that the expertise and approach of the commission is
                                               innovative and critical – we cannot approach addressing this issue
                                               with the same values/worldview that have created the issue of
                                               climate change. We cannot solve this issue just by looking at it from
                                               a science/technology perspective – a focus on culture, indigenous

                                               rights and knowledge and social justice are absolutely fundamental.

                                               I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill
should cover adapting to climate               Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within

Q15. The Government has proposed a             I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance

with the proposed functions?                   • a national adaptation plan
                                               • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                               adaptation plan

                                               • an adaptation reporting power
Q16. Should the Government explore

setting up a targeted adaptation
reporting power that could see some            Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Further comments                               I am hopeful that we as a country can be more and that we can use
                                               this global challenge as an opportunity to create a more sustainable,

                                               just, healthy and diverse nation that is focussed not only on the well-
                                               being of our people and environment now, but also in the future.
                                               Having an effective, long-term framework for mitigation and
                                               adaptation to climate change is crucial for this. This framework must
                                               be future focussed and bind successive governments so that

                                               meaningful action no longer falls victim to three-year election cycles,
                                               it must honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi and not create new
                                               injustices/grievances, and it should bring everyone along on the
                                               journey and allow for just transitions for workers and communities.
                                               Finally, it must happen now. I’m only 20 years old but I have been

                                               scared about climate change and the implications it has for my
                                               future for as long as I can remember, and I’ve been actively
                                               campaigning for climate action since I was 13. Children should not
                                               have to worry about their futures or feel like they themselves will not
                                               be able to have children because of uncertainty about the world they

                                               will inherit. Let’s finally stop talking and make a proper, cross
                                               partisan plan, so that my generation and all coming generations can
                                               have hope and certainty that they will inherit a liveable, prosperous
                                               future.
