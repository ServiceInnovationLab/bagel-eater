A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          It is important because we MUST look after the earth that sustains
because...                                    us. Currently NZ (and the rest of the human race), is trashing it and
                                              other creatures habitats by contributing huge carbon emissions,

                                              contributing to global warming among other things. NZ should take a
                                              stand and STOP carbon emissions to do our part to create a
                                              sustainable future for our children. There can be no economic growth
                                              only sustainability, and NZ could easily achieve that if we STOP our
                                              GREED for more, at the cost of the poor, the displaced, the earth that

                                              provides our food and water the basics that we depend on. WE are
                                              currently allowing greedy businessmen to take more than their fair
                                              share of NZ water to keep industrialised dairy farms working when
                                              the land is not designed for that kind of farming. We have continued
                                              to promote this unsustainable Dairy farming which contributes

                                              hugely to our carbon emissions as well as uses arable land and
                                              wastes water. It also pollutes our water supplies and the lakes, rivers
                                              that we claim are so Clean and Green. The big Lie! So it is time NZ
                                              STOPS being selfish and greedy for short term gain for a few and
                                              INSTEAD supports ZERO carbon emissions and puts the NZ good

                                              earth FIRST for everyone on this land.

Q1. What process should the                   The Government should set a target for 2020 in legislation now. Then
Government use to set a new emissions         maybe we can make some actual impact by 2050. The Govt will face
reduction target in legislation?              opposition from the business sector but the Govt has to have a thick
                                              skin and DO whats right NOT whats wrong just to pacify that sector
                                              who stand to lose profits. If we eventually make an impact and
                                              reduce our carbon and help to reduce global warming and

                                              consequent climate change, then they will benefit anyway.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for      zero by 2020. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                  ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels. WE should stop all mining of

                                              fossil fuels and immediately produce and implement solar and more
                                              wind turbines to generate our power from renewable resources.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           Investment in and promotion of alternative renewable energy
targets?                                      methods. Reduce dairy farming and ban dairy farming that requires
                                              irrigation, to reduce carbon from dairy and the pollution from dairy.
                                              Instead promote a variety of farm produce and ban industrialised

                                              farming that requires high levels of resource consumption and emits
                                              high carbon levels.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2020 target should not be altered in response to “economic
