A Zero Carbon Act is important to me         New Zealand is a very special place to me. But it is becoming
because...                                   endangered by the vigorous climate change

Q1. What process should the                  The Government needs to enshrine a target in legislation as soon as
Government use to set a new emissions        possible, which holds us accountable for achieving our goals. This

reduction target in legislation?             needs to be a cross-party agreement which helps to protect the
                                             goals from being used as political bargaining chips.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050            The most ambitious target. A minimum of carbon neutral, if not
target now, which is the best target for     carbon negative by 2050 or earlier. We need to focus our efforts
New Zealand?                                 based on scientific evidence, rather than public consultation and
                                             political posturing, to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as
                                             impactful as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived

                                             gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. We also
                                             need widespread education to impact the most difficult change of all:
                                             changing the habits of every single person in the country.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its          Domestic emissions targets only. I do not support offsetting by
targets?                                     trading away our climate change obligations using International
                                             Carbon Units. It creates uncertainty about what we need to do in our

                                             own country, and supports other countries' efforts rather than our
                                             own.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow        No - Not in the case of financial changes. This again creates
the 2050 target to be revised if             uncertainty about whether an incoming government may ramp up
circumstances change?                        spending in other other areas, causing the Zero Carbon Bill to
                                             receive less funding/support.

                                             Yes - Where scientific or major international understanding may
                                             require alterations to the Zero Carbon Bill, this should be permitted
                                             by a consensus of the Climate Commission and approved by
                                             government.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be    yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
                                             3 are in effect at all times.

with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to
to alter emissions budgets?                  “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.
                                             However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                             scientific understanding or international agreements should be

                                             permitted.
Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require
Governments to set out plans within a        Yes - It cannot be left open-ended. Timeframes need to be set out for

Further comments                              We are running out of time. We can all see the effects of climate
                                              change in our everyday lives, and something needs to change. We've
                                              seen that the general population, left to our own devices, are not
                                              prepared to make the necessary changes, and the government

                                              needs to step in and take matters out of the our hands. Some habits
                                              (such as driving) are going to be very hard to break, but there are
                                              some easy wins. It's important that we don't focus purely on the big
                                              challenges, or solely on the easy wins, but impact every industry,
