A Zero Carbon Act is important to me         I really want New Zealand to live up to the clean green image that
because...                                   we’ve been portraying to the world, I want my kids and
                                             grandchildren to be left a world as delightful as the one we have

                                             now, and I want us to start switching to a sustainable energy model
                                             while there is still enough time to preserve our way of life.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050            The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net

New Zealand?                                 based approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as

                                             impactful as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived
                                             gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its          By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                     forest planting), and transitioning away from idustries that are
                                             harmful to the environment.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow        As a country we should show resolve, no matter the circumstance.
the 2050 target to be revised if             The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic

circumstances change?                        changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
                                             ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                             understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be    yes, this sounds reasonable. I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15
in place at any given time. Do you agree     years in advance, so that 3 are in effect at all times.

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able Again, we should be resolute. Emissions budgets should not be
to alter emissions budgets?                  altered in response to “economic changes” as this undermines their
                                             long-term certainty. However, the ability to revise budgets in light of
                                             major changes in scientific understanding or international

Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider        The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)

have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Further comments                             It’s time to take a strong stand. The latest climate science indicates

                                             that humanity needs to move fast on this, and I want NZ to be in the
                                             vanguard, to lead on this.
