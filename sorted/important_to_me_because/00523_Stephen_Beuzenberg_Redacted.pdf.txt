Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Further comments                             The issue is climate change, not just zero net carbon. And even this
                                             is just a single, though important, element of the havoc we are
                                             inflicting on our long suffering planet. Zero carbon is an important

                                             first step, but the policy and governance structures we build must be
                                             open enough to address all the threats we a creating, as we become
                                             aware of them.
