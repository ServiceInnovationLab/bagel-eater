A Zero Carbon Act is important to me           A Zero Carbon Act is important for me because as a child I was too
because...                                     scared to think about climate change and the consequences it would
                                               have for my life and my generation. I don't want to have to pass

                                               these fears and uncertainties on to the next generations. The Zero
                                               Carbon Act has the potential to provide a solid structure to New
                                               Zealand’s response and strategy that could alleviate some of this
                                               uncertainty providing ambitious targets are created and met in a
                                               timely manner. After studying environmental and earth science at

                                               university, climate change is an issue that has become very close to
                                               my heart and one that I have a good understanding of. As a New
                                               Zealander I feel an incredibly strong connection to the land and
                                               people and the need to protect this, but New Zealand also has a role
                                               to play globally. We have been looked at as a model of good

                                               governmental practice before and setting in place the Zero Carbon
                                               Act in an well thought out and ambitious way has the opportunity of
                                               having international consequences in the handling of climate
                                               change. I would feel proud as a New Zealander knowing that as a
                                               country we have taken responsibility for our actions and done what

                                               scientific consensus tells us needs to be done for a sustainable future
                                               where humans can thrive. The Zero Carbon Act goes beyond our
                                               freedoms and lifestyles in New Zealand to those living in parts of the
                                               world that will be more affected by climate change and do not have
                                               the resources to respond. To me, at its heart Climate Change is a

                                               human rights issue and therefore the Zero Carbon Act also gives us a
                                               chance to show the world that we value their human rights and
                                               experiences as well as our own. I feel proud in New Zealand that our
                                               government is taking significant steps in tackling climate change but
                                               there is more necessary action which needs to be taken now. I

                                               sincerely hope that the Zero Carbon Act and introduction of a
                                               Climate Change Commission can provide a framework and
                                               commitment that ensures we are world leaders in reducing our
                                               greenhouse gas emissions to zero. Nga mihi, Rose.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050              The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net

target now, which is the best target for       zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                   ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                               we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                               short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its            By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                       forest planting).


                                               Using overseas emissions reductions does not provide a long term
                                               solution as eventually we would have to transition ourselves purely
                                               to domestic reduction. In terms of a smooth gradual transition with
                                               maximum clarity in regards to commitments it makes sense to rely

                                               on domestic emissions reductions only.
Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow          The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic

the 2050 target to be revised if               changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                          ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                               understanding or international agreements should be permitted.
