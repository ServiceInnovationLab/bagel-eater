A Zero Carbon Act is important to me           Climate change is the single biggest issue facing New Zealanders
because...                                     today. I'm 28, and many of my friends are at the point of settling
                                               down and having kids. I would love to be a mother one day, but right

                                               now I'm far too scared about what the future looks like. I can't
                                               imagine bringing up a child in such an uncertain world.

                                               The Zero Carbon Act is my beacon of hope. This climate law will
                                               bring us certainty - an ability to plan ahead and deal with climate

                                               change. It's not just about getting on top of our rising emissions, but
                                               about helping all New Zealanders to adapt. I want a law that leaves
                                               no one behind. Let this piece of legislation set a precedent in
                                               Aotearoa, for giving those who are too often forgotten a seat at the
                                               table and taking a holistic view. Climate change will

                                               disproportionately affect those who are already vulnerable
                                               (financially or otherwise) and this must be taken into account.

                                               A Zero Carbon Act speaks to me of what New Zealanders are truly
                                               made of. For too long we've passed off responsibility for doing our bit

                                               in this global fight. I want to be proud to say I'm a New Zealander. I
                                               want to live in a country where we don't shy away from a problem,
                                               but use our creativity, kiwi ingenuity and courage to get on and
                                               tackle it. I'm excited by the possibilities that the Zero Carbon Act will
                                               enable, and I can't wait to see it passed into law.

Q1. What process should the
Government use to set a new emissions          I urge the Government to set a 2050 target in legislation now.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050              The way the three options are presented makes it seem like they are
target now, which is the best target for       mutually-exclusive, but what we should be aiming for is a
New Zealand?                                   combination of option 2 and 3. I want NZ to set an ambitious target
                                               of reducing TOTAL greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050, but I also
                                               support taking a science-based approach to how we deal with the

                                               different gases. We should be aiming for negative levels of long-lived
                                               gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. Short-
                                               lived gases like methane do not need to reach zero, and by setting
                                               this target we'd be placing an unfair burden on farmers.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its            By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                       forest planting). Using international carbon trading should NOT be

                                               allowed!!
Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow          The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic

the 2050 target to be revised if               changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                          ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                               understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be      Yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that

with this proposal?

                                               However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                               scientific understanding or international agreements should be

                                               permitted.
Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

Q10. What are the most important

what else needs to be considered?            should not be forgotten.

Q11. The Government has proposed that
the Climate Change Commission advises        Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.
                                             However, the Government should be legally required to consider and

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:

Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.
