                                             while it reduces emissions at the same time.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow

                                             Any Government can be permitted to emit less than the target.

                                             The Government should take into account:

                                             scientific knowledge regarding climate change
                                             technology relevant to climate change

                                             those responsible for the emissions.

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require
Governments to set out plans within a
certain timeframe to achieve the             Yes
emissions budgets?
Q10. What are the most important             The most important issues to consider are Te Tiriti o Waitangi

                                             Other considerations include sustainable economic opportunities and

agree with these functions?

Q12. What role do you think the Climate
Change Commission should have in             The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in
                                             the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to the

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)

proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests
                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,

                                             • community engagement and communications.

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.
