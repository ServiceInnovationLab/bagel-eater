A Zero Carbon Act is important to me           We as a nation are going to inevitably facing the consequences for
because...                                     any inaction or action we do now. Thus it is crucial that we take this
                                               step towards dealing to the problem for the sake of future

                                               generations and the continued viability of life on this planet. Climate
                                               change will not be the end of the world, but it will make life much
                                               more difficult in the long run.

Q1. What process should the                    The Government needs to set a target for 2050 in legislation now.
Government use to set a new emissions          Earlier would be preferable of course, however I appreciate that
reduction target in legislation?               pragmatism is necessary.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050              Total green house gas reduction is necessary, not simply ambitious
target now, which is the best target for       like it has been labeled. This means reducing total greenhouse gases

New Zealand?                                   to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach
                                               to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as
                                               possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while
                                               reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its            By using domestic emissions reductions only, those Russian and
targets?                                       Ukrainian carbon credits are illegitimate.


                                               A good way to utilize our market based economy would be by taxing
                                               goods that have their emission costs externalized at any point in
                                               their supply chain or production (yes that includes agricultural
                                               products). Make emitters pay for having done so, and spur and

                                               encourage innovation to avoid doing so. We need to incentivise
                                               economic behavior that moves away from green house gas emitting
                                               activities.

                                               We need to take externalized environmental costs within our

                                               economy more seriously, and figure out ways of including them into
                                               our economic metrics like GDP.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow          The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if               changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                          ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                               understanding or international agreements should be permitted in

                                               bringing the date forward. Remember, climate experts often stress
                                               that they use conservative predictions, we may find things are much
                                               worse as our understanding grows.

Q5. The Government proposes that               yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
three emissions budgets of five years
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be      3 are in effect at all times. Previous climate action in New Zealand

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to
to alter emissions budgets?                    “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.
                                               However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                               scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                               permitted. The investment will be paid back in full by not having to

                                               face as severe consequences latter on.
Q8. Do you agree with the proposed            I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

the Climate Commission will need to           setting budgets:

                                              economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the

                                              economy
                                              • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on

                                              the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require       Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change
Governments to set out plans within a         Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan. Words

                                              sense really.

Q10. What are the most important              The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
issues for the Government to consider         comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and

                                              along with bureaucrats on government salaries whom are
                                              concentrated in our larger cities. Every New Zealander regardless of
                                              their background, income or location within the country needs to be
                                              empowered by this Bill. This means making it easier for working
                                              people, families the poor etc to be able to live cleaner and greener

                                              lives too.

Q11. The Government has proposed that Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.

                                              accidentally be swept up under the rug.

Q12. What role do you think the Climate
                                              The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in

Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to          • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable       • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour

expertise. Do you agree with the              markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                           • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests
                                              • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori

                                              • community engagement and communications.

                                              I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill
should cover adapting to climate              Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within

Q15. The Government has proposed a          I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance

                                            • regular review of progress towards implementing the national

                                            • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation

reporting power that could see some         Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
