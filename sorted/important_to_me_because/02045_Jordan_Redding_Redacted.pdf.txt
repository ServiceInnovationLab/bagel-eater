A Zero Carbon Act is important to me           A Zero Carbon Act is important me because I live in this world. The
because...                                     decisions that I make in life have an impact on others. Likewise the
                                               decisions we make as a country have an impact. We live inter-

                                               connected lives, not only spatially but temporally. The Zero Carbon
                                               Act is a positive step in addressing the negative impact we as a
                                               nation and I as an individual have on the planet.

                                               As a Christian, I believe in a God who created this world in loving

                                               freedom, a God who is actively at work in the world bringing healing
                                               and life. As humans, I believe, we have a responsibility to share in
                                               God's work, stewarding and caring for this world and all life-forms
                                               that inhabit it.

Q1. What process should the                    The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now.
Government use to set a new emissions          Although I also wonder whether we need to set a limit on green-

reduction target in legislation?               house gas emissions as well. After all, emissions that we pump into
                                               atmosphere before 2050 will continue to have a warming effect
                                               decades and centuries later.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050              The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for       zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                   ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                               we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing

                                               short-lived gases to sustainable levels. A two-baskets approach,
                                               treating long-lived and short-lived gases differently is important to
                                               ensure a smooth economic transition as well as to recognise the
                                               complexity of the issue.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its            By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                       forest planting). While carbon credits (even verifiably beneficial

                                               credits) may be an easy way to meet our targets they are not
                                               addressing the problem itself. We also should not rely on new forest
                                               planting. While it is an important growing industry, forestry presents
                                               its own issues (e.g. land erosion, conservation issues). We need to be
                                               reducing emissions in our energy sector, in the agricultural sector,

                                               and in our own lifestyles. Enabling individuals and families to do this
                                               efficiently and easily will be important.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow          The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if               changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                          ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                               understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years
                                               Yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be      3 are in effect at all times.

with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to
to alter emissions budgets?                    “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.
                                               However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in

                                               scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                               permitted. There should also be some flexibility in light of unforeseen
                                               national disasters. In extreme circumstances it may be necessary for
                                               a Government to alter a budget to make it less ambitious. But there
                                               should be measures in place to make sure this can't be abused

                                               simply because a budget is too difficult or too expensive to
                                               accomplish.
Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

                                             economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the

                                             economy

                                             supplies and
                                             the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require      Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change
Governments to set out plans within a
certain timeframe to achieve the             Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan. Twelve
emissions budgets?                           months from the setting of the next budget sounds reasonable.

Q10. What are the most important

issues for the Government to consider        The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
in setting plans to meet budgets? For        comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and
example, who do we need to work with,        reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that
the Climate Change Commission advises Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body. But the

Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?                     number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:

Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests
                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori

                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,
                                             insurance and local
                                             government

                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure

                                             • community engagement and communications.
                                             • business competitiveness
                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology
                                             development system.


                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill       Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within
should cover adapting to climate             the Climate Commission. Having a robust, unified approach to
change?                                      adaptation will be increasingly important over time. Sea-level rise,
                                             increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events, as
                                             well as a generally warming climate will disproportionately affect
                                             some areas of the country as well as vulnerable and lower socio-

                                             economic demographics. We need a plan that will fairly and
                                             equitably provide for those most affected.
Q15. The Government has proposed a           I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance

with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan
                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                             adaptation plan
                                             • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation

reporting power that could see some          Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Further comments                             I'm delighted this is happening. I hope the Act will be ambitious and
                                             strong in addressing our domestic emissions. While I think there is
                                             some scope as to how ambitious we make this Act, the science is

                                             now clear: we need to drastically reduce our emissions now. No
                                             doubt this will not be easy, but the alternative (doing nothing or
                                             simply not enough) will be far more difficult. The time has come (and
                                             is well overdue) for radical action on anthropogenic climate change.
