A Zero Carbon Act is important to me           I've been getting increasingly worried about climate change - it
because...                                     seems we needed to act 20 years ago, so now it's really urgent and
                                               we need to get the strongest possible law. It already seems like

                                               we're hearing about more and more extreme weather events related
                                               to climate change, and we need to act before this whole thing gets
                                               out of control. As I consider whether to have children and what kind
                                               of world I would be bringing them into, it really puts into perspective
                                               the fundamental importance of a stable climate. It's not just the

                                               rising sea levels, but all the other things - spread of diseases beyond
                                               their current boundaries, more mosquitos and other pests, increase
                                               in floods, major storms, hurricanes and all the human suffering and
                                               huge cost that comes with those events. Having seen the suffering
                                               and umimaginable costs caused by the Christchurch quakes, we just

                                               can't afford to have more disasters affecting our communities &
                                               businesses. Plus imagine the insurance costs skyrocketing as well,
                                               both for families and for businesses - it just seems like we have to do
                                               something about this before all of these human, commercial and
                                               general financial costs get out of control!

Q1. What process should the                    The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now.

Government use to set a new emissions          There also need to be short-term, binding targets so that this is
reduction target in legislation?               constantly on the political and business agenda and provides
                                               certainty for us all.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050              The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for       zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                   ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                               we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing

                                               short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its            By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                       forest planting). It puts the power and certainty of our own future in
                                               our hands rather than relying on potentially volatile and escalating
                                               international carbon markets. Plus if everyone relies on international
                                               credits rather than making change locally, then we don't really get

                                               anywhere!

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow          The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if               changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. My dad runs his
circumstances change?                          own business, and nothing negatively effects business decision-
                                               making like uncertainty. However, revising the 2050 target in light of
                                               major changes in scientific consensus on climate change, or
                                               international agreements should be allowed.

Q5. The Government proposes that               Yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that

three emissions budgets of five years          3 are in effect at all times. Again, certainty is crucial for business and
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be for the Government as well, and we need politicians to be looking
in place at any given time. Do you agree beyond the 3-year parliamentary term, and for all political parties
with this proposal?                            (especially the major 2 parties) to work on this enormous challenge
                                               together.

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to

to alter emissions budgets?                    “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.
                                               However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                               the consensus of scientific understanding or international
                                               agreements should be allowed.
                                               Also, if the Government doesn't put in place the emissions budget

                                               recommended by the Climate Commission, then it should have to put
                                               a formal public response to the Commission to explain why.
Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should
considerations that the Government and take the following factors into consideration when advising on and

the Climate Commission will need to          setting budgets:
take into account when advising on and       • scientific knowledge regarding climate change
setting budgets?                             • technology relevant to climate change
                                             • economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the
                                             economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the

                                             economy
                                             • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on
                                             taxation, public spending and public borrowing
                                             • social circumstances, making sure there is not a disproportionate
                                             burden on the poorest people, and the likely impact of any decision

                                             on fuel poverty
                                             • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy
                                             supplies and the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require      Yes - goals and plans with short timeframes need to be put in place
Governments to set out plans within a        now as none of us as individuals or institutions are long-sighted
certain timeframe to achieve the             enough to look at a target 30 years away when making decisions
emissions budgets?                           today! It's important that we learn from the mistakes of the UK's

                                             Climate Change Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a
                                             plan.

Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider        The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
in setting plans to meet budgets? For        comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and
example, who do we need to work with,        reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.

what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that
the Climate Change Commission advises Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body. They
on and monitors New Zealand's                should be politically neutral, and their budget should not be subject
progress towards its goals. Do you           to the whims of the current government of the day.
agree with these functions?

Q12. What role do you think the Climate
Change Commission should have in             The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in
                                             the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to the
relation to the New Zealand Emissions        number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)

proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests
                                             • climate science and environmental science including mātauranga
                                             Māori
                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,
                                             insurance and local

                                             government
                                             • risk management
                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                             • community engagement and communications.
                                             • business competitiveness

                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology
                                             development system.

                                             I think expertise in public health is also very important as.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill
should cover adapting to climate             Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within
change?                                      the Climate Commission.
Q15. The Government has proposed a           I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance
number of new functions to help us           is required in terms of how local councils are involved:

adapt to climate change. Do you agree        • a national climate change risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan
                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                             adaptation plan
                                             • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation

reporting power that could see some          Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Further comments                             Please please, all political parties need to come together on this bill.
                                             Climate change is the biggest threat facing us together, please let's
                                             not play politics and put the interests of ourselves and future

                                             generations above short-term political gain.
