A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          Primarily because this is so urgent and my generation are the ones
because...                                    who will have the suffer the consequences and pay the high cost of
                                              transition - if we don't start now.

                                              Additionally, I believe democracies are not good at slow quiet
                                              problems like climate change - we are better adjusted to sudden
                                              short term problems. We need a mechanism that will guide NZ and
                                              our Government to a future that we all deserve, and our children
                                              deserve.

                                              Lastly, as we all know, the costs of climate change are too great in
                                              their impact and also the transition. Plenty of far smarter and more
                                              educated people can break down those costs for us. But simply all I
                                              want to put forward to this: we need to be part of the transition
                                              quickly, so we as a community can prosper through that. We need to

                                              be part of the transition, so we know our actions are creating a
                                              better future for my generation and my children's generation. It was
                                              morally reprehensible to not do something ten years ago, and the
                                              demand is even greater now. This isn't a simple problem to reject,
                                              either for you are for the future we want to live in - or you are

                                              against that safe prosperous future.

Q1. What process should the                   The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now. It
Government use to set a new emissions         should be legally binding and they should be held accountable to it.
reduction target in legislation?              We cannot allow short term distractions, to have us ignore our
                                              greater obligations to Kiwis, our children, our global community and
                                              our planet.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for      zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to

New Zealand?                                  ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                      forest planting). If we rely on international markets too much or let a
                                              loop hole in the system, we allow ourselves to fail in our goals - as

                                              such systems can be too easily manipulated as cheap carbon credits
                                              in the NZ ETS have shown.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. Businesses and
circumstances change?                         government planning need to know where we are going, and what is
                                              required. We are undermining the business community in NZ by
                                              being weak or hesitant in our approach. However, the ability to

                                              revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                              understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years         Yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be 3 are in effect at all times. This provides certainty for our business
in place at any given time. Do you agree community and local/central govt.

with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to
to alter emissions budgets?                   “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.
                                              However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                              scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                              permitted.
Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

the Climate Commission will need to          setting budgets:
take into account when advising on and       • scientific knowledge regarding climate change

                                             • economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the
                                             economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the

                                             economy
                                             • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on
                                             taxation, public spending and public borrowing
                                             • social circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on
                                             communities and wellbeing

                                             • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy
                                             supplies and
                                             the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.

Q10. What are the most important

issues for the Government to consider        The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
in setting plans to meet budgets? For        comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and
example, who do we need to work with,        reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that
the Climate Change Commission advises        Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.
                                             However, the Government should be legally required to consider and
on and monitors New Zealand's                formally respond to the Commission’s advice, and to provide an
progress towards its goals. Do you           explanation if they do not act on it.

Q12. What role do you think the Climate      The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in

Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?                     number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:

Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests
                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori

                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,
                                             insurance and local
                                             government
                                             • risk management
                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure

                                             • community engagement and communications.
                                             • business competitiveness

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.
