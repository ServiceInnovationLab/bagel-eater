A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          I am deeply concerned that our government and the country as a
because...                                    whole does not have a detailed plan for how to progress a drop in our
                                              carbon emissions. Our climate is changing now and we really have

                                              no idea what changes are to come. By not working hard to get
                                              carbon out of our atmosphere we are putting a great deal at risk. In
                                              my view this bill needs to go beyond zero carbon into negative
                                              carbon territory. It is clear that we must find ways to remove
                                              greenhouse gases from the atmosphere - and not just to stop putting

                                              them in, in the light of current changes and the projected changes
                                              that look to be well on the way.

Q1. What process should the                   Set a target for 2045 in legislation now and ensure there is a
Government use to set a new emissions         detailed, well thought out plan to meet that target and 5 yearly
reduction target in legislation?              interim targets along the way. The plan should be revised at least
                                              every 5 years to ensure we are able to take advantage of or manage

                                              new developments.
Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             We need the most ambitious target possible for reducing greenhouse

target now, which is the best target for      gases beyond net zero by 2050. We must use an evidence based
New Zealand?                                  approach to ensure that our efforts are effective. We should aim to
                                              remove long-lived gases from the atmosphere, while also reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           We must reduce our domestic carbon emissions. This might include
targets?                                      planting new forests and increasing soil carbon. We must also be

                                              making significant efforts to decrease emissions from activities such
                                              as transport, agriculture and our use of energy in general.
                                              It must NOT include the purchasing of overseas carbon credits which
                                              seem unethical at best, and fraudulent at worst .

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         I believe that the only way the 2050 target should be modified is to
the 2050 target to be revised if              increase the net amount of carbon that we will be taking out of the

circumstances change?                         atmosphere by that time. It would be ideal to change the zero carbon
                                              target to an earlier date particularly as our scientific understanding
                                              increases.
                                              Changing targets in the in the opposite direction, particularly
                                              because of economic changes undermines the point of this bill and

                                              misses the point that not aiming hard for zero carbon and helping
                                              other nations to reach the same will have huge economic costs.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years         yes. These budgets should be evaluated and revised regularly
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be perhaps every year or two to ensure that we actually meet the
in place at any given time. Do you agree targets that are set in them.
with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able Yes the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in scientific

to alter emissions budgets?                   understanding or international agreements should be permitted if
                                              that means we will meet our overal target earlier. The budgets
                                              should not be changed to allow slippage in meeting targets.
Q8. Do you agree with the proposed            Yes, we must consider

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require       Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change

Governments to set out plans within a         Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan. plans need

                                              We also need to consider how we reward and encourage more of the

                                              those who are already taking action to mitigate emissions as could
                                              happen depending on how carbon credits might be allocated (if a
                                              ETS is used rather than a tax) Likewise any tax must be progressive
                                              and not regressive. it should not impact more on the poor who
                                              already by definition use fewer resources and emit less carbon than

Q12. What role do you think the Climate
Change Commission should have in              In my view the Commission should provide advice on policy settings

Q13. The Government has proposed that Yes I agree with the proposed expertise as follows:

                                              Because of likely social and health impacts of policies and plans to

Further comments                             This is a really important bill that needs to be as strong as possible

                                             AND get cross party support. The Act needs to be effective in the
                                             long term and not just for the term of any particular government.
