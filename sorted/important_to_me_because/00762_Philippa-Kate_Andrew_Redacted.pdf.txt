A Zero Carbon Act is important to me         Everything that makes my life worth living will be affected by climate
because...                                   change. I enjoy outdoor activities, seasonal produce, being out in
                                             nature and seeing the amazing native marine animals. We must

                                             protect our taonga and climate change will affect them drastically.

Q1. What process should the                  It is not enough to set a target, there must also be a detailed and

reduction target in legislation?             Otherwise it is nothing more than an empty promise.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050            The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for     zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                 ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                             we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing

                                             short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its          By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                     forest planting). New Zealand also needs to make sure that the
                                             biggest polluters make the biggest changes, so that it is not a
                                             burden solely held by the "common folk".

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow        The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if             changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the

                                             understanding should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years        yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be 3 are in effect at all times. I think that covers a long enough time
in place at any given time. Do you agree that changes can be put in place and measured in terms of efficacy.

                                             scientific understanding should be permitted.

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

the Climate Commission will need to          setting budgets:

                                             economy
                                             • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on

                                             taxation, public spending and public borrowing

                                             I also think that specific actions that have double benefits should be
                                             prioritised, e.g. improving

Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider        The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)

have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour

proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests

                                             I think expertise in public health and social services is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill
should cover adapting to climate             Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within

Further comments                             Environmental protection is often framed as a personal choice,

                                             something for individuals to opt in or out of. It needs to be made a
                                             piority on a legal scale so that large businesses cannot lobby their

                                             Action will have greater impact if it is made on a large scale to start
