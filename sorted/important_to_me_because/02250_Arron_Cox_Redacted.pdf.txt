A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          Climate change poses a threat to New Zealand and we need a plan
because...                                    to address climate change. This plan is the Zero Carbon Act.


                                              It is important that we address climate change to ensure a fair and
                                              thriving future to Aotearoa New Zealand.

Q1. What process should the
Government use to set a new emissions         The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now.
reduction target in legislation?

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for      zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                  ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:

                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                      forest planting).

                                              IF Parliament decides to use international carbon credits to reduce

                                              emissions they should; reduce the volume of credits used over time
                                              to zero; and ensure the credits being used are valid and not fake.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. This thinking
circumstances change?                         priorities 'the economy' over the environment, the two mist be
                                              considered equal. 'Economic Changes' are also broad meaning a

                                              Government could change the target to address short term economic
                                              challenges which could have long term environmental impact.

                                              However, the ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major
                                              changes in scientific understanding or international agreements

                                              should be permitted.

                                              All changes to the 2050 target should be made by Parliament
                                              through an Amendment Bill. Changes should be well publicised with
                                              sufficient reasons given.

Q5. The Government proposes that              Yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
three emissions budgets of five years         3 are in effect at all times.

in place at any given time. Do you agree A plan to meet these budgets shall be made public within 3 years of

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to

                                              However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in

                                              scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                              permitted.

                                              The plan to meet the Budgets should also be somewhat 'set in stone'
                                              however changes should be made in light of scientific or

agree with these functions?

Q12. What role do you think the Climate
Change Commission should have in             The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.
