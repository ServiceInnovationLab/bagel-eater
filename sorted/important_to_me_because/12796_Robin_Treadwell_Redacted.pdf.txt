A Zero Carbon Act is important to me         I want to have a liveable world for my grand daughter and her peers
because...                                   to enjoy, as well as other people and creatures on the planet.

Government use to set a new emissions        The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050            The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net

New Zealand?                                 ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                             we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                             short-lived gases to sustainable levels as soon as possible. We dont
                                             know when the world might reach a 'tipping point' with catastrophic

                                             ice melting, sea level rise and release of methane from permafrost.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its          By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                     forest planting).

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow        The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic

                                             understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.
