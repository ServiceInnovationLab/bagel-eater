                                              all need to do everything in our power to stop its effects which will be

                                              catastrophic if it is left unchecked. I sincerely doubt whether this will
                                              be possible in a consumerist democracy, but I would like to see it
                                              tried.

Q1. What process should the

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The best target is the most ambitious target: reducing total
target now, which is the best target for      greenhouse gases to zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-

New Zealand?                                  based approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as
                                              impactful as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived
                                              gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only. There should be no
targets?                                      emissions trading.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be able to be altered as this undermines

circumstances change?                         emissions. There is a real problem in that an incoming Government
                                              may be inclined to ignore the very difficult issues of achieving zero
                                              emissions. I see the biggest problem lies in holding future
                                              Governments to the same degree of commitment over time.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be     yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that

in place at any given time. Do you agree
with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be able to be altered. The target
to alter emissions budgets?                   must be zero emissions and it must not be possible for an incoming
                                              Government to set easier targets in the short term knowing that they
                                              will not be the ones who have to deal with the long-term implications

                                              for society.
Q8. Do you agree with the proposed            I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

the Climate Commission will need to           setting budgets:
take into account when advising on and        • scientific knowledge regarding climate change
setting budgets?                              • technology relevant to climate change
                                              • economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the
                                              economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the

                                              economy
                                              • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on
                                              taxation, public spending and public borrowing
                                              • social circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel

                                              supplies and
                                              the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.

                                              However the focus must be what the Parliamentary Commissioner for

                                              the Environment has called the "strong sustainability model" in
                                              which the economy is a subset of society, which itself is a subset of
                                              the environment. If we destroy the environment we destroy human
                                              society and then there is no economy. The environmental aspect
                                              must be the priority, if we get that wrong there will be no future for
                                              humankind.

Q10. What are the most important              The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be

what else needs to be considered?             for the least cost. The over-riding concern should be to achieve zero
                                              emissions of all greenhouse gases, otherwise these other factors will
                                              be irrelevant.

Q11. The Government has proposed that Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.

                                              as we move towards 2050.

Q12. What role do you think the Climate       The ETS should not be employed as a way towards achieving zero

                                              polluting. To a great extent it is the unfettered market model that
                                              has created climate change and it seems unwise to try to use that
                                              flawed model to solve the problem that it has created.
Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to

have a range of essential and desirable       • climate and environmental science
expertise. Do you agree with the              • climate change policy (probably not including emissions trading)
proposed expertise?                           • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
                                              markets and distribution)

                                              • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,
                                              insurance and local
                                              government
                                              • risk management
                                              • engineering and/or infrastructure

                                              • community engagement and communications.
                                              • business competitiveness
                                              • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology
                                              development system.


                                              I think expertise in public health is also important. The most
                                              important of these is undoubtedly climate and environmental science
                                              because if this is not the focus then the whole exercise will have little
                                              point.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill
should cover adapting to climate              Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within

Q15. The Government has proposed a            I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance

with the proposed functions?                  • a national adaptation plan
                                              • regular review of progress towards implementing the national

                                              • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation
reporting power that could see some           Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Further comments                              The changing climate is an existential threat to humanity. 2050 is
                                              roughly as far in the future as 1990 is in the past, it is not far away in

                                              time. So far we are seeing no positive changes - we still have
                                              expanding air travel, manufacturers are building and selling SUVs,
                                              New Zealand is increasing its reliance on selling meat and dairy
                                              products and Wellington has replaced its electric trolleybuses with
                                              diesels. We have to reverse all this completely and we have thirty

                                              years in which to do it. If we do not manage this human civilisation
                                              will deserve to survive into the future.

                                              Please get it right.
