A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          climate change affects everything and everyone. My concern is that
because...                                    it's such a long term thing that by the time we really feel the
                                              consequences, it will already be far too late. We're sheltered from it

                                              at the moment, we already see the impacts it's having and it's
                                              catastrophic for many smaller developing nations. Let's focus on
                                              doing what we can do right now so we can do more in the future.

Q1. What process should the
Government use to set a new emissions         I think a legislated target by 2050 will have to be put in place as
reduction target in legislation?              soon as possible. Ideally with milestones along the way.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for      zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to

New Zealand?                                  ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           With tangible and realistic emissions reductions locally. e.g. planting
targets?                                      trees, electric fleets, sustainable agriculture.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         It depends on the circumstances. Targets should only go up if
the 2050 target to be revised if              anything. There are always pressures but anything that's not

circumstances change?                         scientifically and internationally backed and supported would
                                              generally be more self-serving and counter to the core principles of
                                              the targets.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years         I think that sounds reasonable. China has something similar with
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be their long term strategy, it makes sense to plan as much as possible
in place at any given time. Do you agree so we know how we're tracking.

with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able I would say no. The risk if we allow this is the potential to use the
to alter emissions budgets?                   economy as an excuse and changes in economy to justify lowering
                                              targets which would defeat the purpose of the targets. It's like
                                              setting training targets for a marathon and then making up excuses.
                                              On race day, we won't be able to achieve what we wanted and we

                                              will suffer much more as a consequence.

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed            I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should
considerations that the Government and take the following factors into consideration when advising on and
the Climate Commission will need to           setting budgets:
take into account when advising on and        • scientific knowledge regarding climate change
setting budgets?                              • technology relevant to climate change

                                              • economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the
                                              economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the
                                              economy
                                              • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on
                                              taxation, public spending and public borrowing

                                              • social circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel
                                              poverty
                                              • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy
                                              supplies and
                                              the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require
Governments to set out plans within a         Definitely. Plans without time frames and milestones aren't really

certain timeframe to achieve the              plans, they're just dreams.

Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider       The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be

in setting plans to meet budgets? For       comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and
example, who do we need to work with,       reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that
the Climate Change Commission advises

agree with these functions?

Q12. What role do you think the Climate
Change Commission should have in            As above, it should serve an advisory function only.
relation to the New Zealand Emissions
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to        • climate change policy (including emissions trading)

have a range of essential and desirable     • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the            markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                         • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests
                                            • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
                                            • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,

                                            insurance and local
                                            government
                                            • risk management
                                            • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                            • community engagement and communications.

                                            • business competitiveness
                                            • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology

                                            I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill
should cover adapting to climate            We need an adaptation plan now, so yes.

Q15. The Government has proposed a          I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance
number of new functions to help us          is required in terms of how local councils are involved:

with the proposed functions?                • a national adaptation plan
                                            • regular review of progress towards implementing the national

                                            • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation

organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
