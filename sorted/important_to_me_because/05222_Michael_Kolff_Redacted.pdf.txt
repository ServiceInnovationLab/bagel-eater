A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          Our future and our children's future depends on getting this enacted
because...                                    as quickly and as comprehensibly as we can. Much time has already
                                              been lost and the consequences of business as usual for those yet to

                                              be born are to great too great for inaction to be an option

Q1. What process should the                   The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now.
Government use to set a new emissions         Every effort must be made to frame the legislation in a way that
reduction target in legislation?              makes it as difficult as possible for any future Government to take a
                                              passive approach to reductions in carbon and other greenhouse gas
                                              emissions

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             It is imperative that we make the goal as ambitious as possible. All

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           All our carbon budget needs to be met from New Zealand based
targets?                                      credits. This is a huge opportunity to invest in conservation and
                                              regeneration of our own lands. We need to be in control of the

                                              the investment in our own land care.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic

the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years

                                              However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                              scientific understanding or international agreements should be

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed            I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

the Climate Commission will need to           setting budgets:

                                              • economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the

                                              economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the
                                              economy
                                              • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on
                                              taxation, public spending and public borrowing
                                              • social circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel

                                              poverty
                                              • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy
                                              supplies and
                                              the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.


                                              However, I do not think that economic considerstions should ever be
                                              a reason for delaying or pausing the net zero 2050 target. The
                                              economy must be made to serve the saving of our climate and not
                                              the destruction of our climate to serve some idea of how the
                                              economy should be. Quantitative easing was an option to bail out

                                              banks. Quantitative easing can easily be used to bail out the climate

emissions budgets?

Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider        The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
in setting plans to meet budgets? For        comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and

agree with these functions?

Q12. What role do you think the Climate
Change Commission should have in             The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy
have a range of essential and desirable      • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests
expertise. Do you agree with the             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
proposed expertise?                          • engineering and/or infrastructure

                                             • community engagement and communications.
                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill

with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan

                                             • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation

Further comments                             If we do not limit the acceptable credits to New Zealand based only
                                             then we risk losing most of the opportunity that comes with setting a
                                             zero carbon target. If we want to benefit society here then we need
                                             to develop low carbon technology here rather than fund overseas
                                             enterprise. We need to regenerate our own long term forests and

                                             grow and produce our own sustainable food and incentivise our own

                                             The economy must be put to the service of climate change
                                             mitigation and not be used as an excuse for failing to take action. We

                                             can and must do this and must take all sectors of NZ society along
                                             together
