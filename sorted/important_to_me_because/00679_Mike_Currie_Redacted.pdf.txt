A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          We need to commit to carbon zero for the same reason that we need
because...                                    to reduce fossil fuel usage to zero and that is because if we don't,
                                              global warming, sea level rise and all the associated consequences

                                              will make an end to the existence of life on the planet as we know it .

Q1. What process should the
Government use to set a new emissions         The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now.
reduction target in legislation?

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for      zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                  ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing

                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                      forest planting). International Carbon Credits should not be counted
                                              in the net NZ greenhouse gases as NZ needs to reduce its ACTUAL
                                              net GHG to zero.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the

                                              understanding or international agreements should be permitted,
                                              provided the target date is reduced, not increased.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be     yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
in place at any given time. Do you agree      3 are in effect at all times.

with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to
to alter emissions budgets?                   “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.
                                              However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                              scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                              permitted, provided the budgets are increased, not reduced.

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed            I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

considerations that the Government and take the following factors into consideration when advising on and
the Climate Commission will need to           setting budgets:
take into account when advising on and        • scientific knowledge regarding climate change

                                              • economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the

                                              economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the
                                              economy
                                              • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on
                                              taxation, public spending and public borrowing
                                              • social circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel

                                              poverty
                                              • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy

                                              the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require       Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change
Governments to set out plans within a         Act and specify a strict time frame for producing
certain timeframe to achieve the              policy plans which should be either 6 or 12 months after a budget

Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider        The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be

in setting plans to meet budgets? For        comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and
example, who do we need to work with,        reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that
the Climate Change Commission advises Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body. In
on and monitors New Zealand's                addition to monitoring our progress the Commission should hold the
progress towards its goals. Do you           government to account.

Q12. What role do you think the Climate      The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in

relation to the New Zealand Emissions
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?                     number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)

have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests
                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,

                                             insurance and local
                                             government
                                             • risk management
                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                             • community engagement and communications.

                                             • business competitiveness
                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology
                                             development system.

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill
should cover adapting to climate             Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within
                                             the Climate Commission.

Q15. The Government has proposed a           I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance
number of new functions to help us           is required in terms of how local councils are involved:
adapt to climate change. Do you agree        • a national climate change risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan
                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national

                                             adaptation plan
                                             • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation
reporting power that could see some          Yes
organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Further comments                             We need to do this at once, and we need to do it right to ensure the

                                             future of life on this planet as we know it. Kia Kaha!
