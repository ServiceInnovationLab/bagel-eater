A Zero Carbon Act is important to me         Humanity faces existential threats this century by exceeding the
because...                                   limits to growth essentially driven by neoliberal free market
                                             economics: these include mega species extinctions, massive climate

                                             disruption including sea level rise etc, and massive social
                                             disruption/homelessness etc driven by growing inequality. A Zero
                                             Carbon Act is a step towards averting catastrophe.:

Q1. What process should the                  The Government should set a target for 2050 for net zero carbon
Government use to set a new emissions        emissions in legislation now, guided by science-based advice from
reduction target in legislation?             the proposed Climate Change Commission..

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050            The only realistic target for avoiding existential threats (refer above)
target now, which is the best target for     is to reduce total greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050. This must

New Zealand?                                 be achieved by taking a science-based approach to ensure that
                                             efforts to reduce carbon emissions are as impactful as possible.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its          By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                     forest planting). In particular, New Zealand must not rely on
                                             purchasing external carbon credits. New Zealand has allegedly
                                             bought fraudulent credits and has used these to meet this country’s

                                             CP2 reduction targets. New Zealand’s climate change policy is based
                                             on an outright scam which speaks volumes about the honesty and
                                             commitment to real change of previous political and economic
                                             leaders who collectively are responding totally inadequately to
                                             anthropogenic global warming.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow        The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic

the 2050 target to be revised if             changes” as this could undermine its long-term certainty by allowing
circumstances change?                        neoclassical economic arguments to prevail over ecological
                                             economic arguments. However, the ability to revise the 2050 target
                                             in light of major changes in scientific understanding (or by
                                             international agreements consistent with these changes) should be

                                             permitted.
Q5. The Government proposes that

each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be    3 are in effect at all times.

with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to
to alter emissions budgets?                  “economic changes” (generally based on neoliberal free market

                                             economics as this undermines their long-term certainty). However,
                                             the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in scientific
                                             understanding (or international agreements consistent with these
                                             changes) should be permitted.
Q8. Do you agree with the proposed            I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require
Governments to set out plans within a         Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change
certain timeframe to achieve the              Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan.

emissions budgets?

Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider         The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
in setting plans to meet budgets? For         science-based, comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally
example, who do we need to work with,         sustainable, and reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that No. It is self-evident to this physicist that applying a market solution

the Climate Change Commission advises to the “greatest … market failure ever seen” is unlikely to succeed
on and monitors New Zealand's                 despite the faith of neoliberal free market believers in it. Put
progress towards its goals. Do you            succinctly, “emissions trading is unfair, it is unethical, and it just
agree with these functions?                   doesn't work". Pre-eminent climate scientist James Hansen told a
                                              carbon trading conference in New York that carbon trading is “a path

                                              focused on corporate greed”. It increases the cost of energy for the
                                              public, as utilities and industries purchase the right to pollute, with
                                              one hand adding it to fuel prices, while with the other hand taking
                                              back most of the permit revenues from the government. I have
                                              concluded that the Government should not attempt to mitigate
                                              anthropogenic global overheating by applying neoliberal free market

                                              economics inherent in emissions trading schemes, but should scrap
                                              the ETS altogether and in its place introduce a science-based carbon
                                              budget and a carbon charge/tax.

Q12. What role do you think the Climate
Change Commission should have in              None. The scheme should be scrapped altogether (see response to
relation to the New Zealand Emissions         Q11 above).

Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?
Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to          • climate science, in particular anthropogenic global warming

have a range of essential and desirable       (essential)
expertise. Do you agree with the              • anthropogenic global warming policy (including awareness of the
proposed expertise?                           limitations of emissions trading)

                                              (excluding mātauranga Māori)

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill        Yes, but of secondary concern compared with achieving net zero
should cover adapting to climate              carbon emissions by 2050. . This may require a separate adaptation
change?                                       sub-committee within the Climate Commission.

Q15. The Government has proposed a            I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance
number of new functions to help us            is required in terms of how local councils are involved:

adapt to climate change. Do you agree         • a national anthropogenic global warming risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                  • a national adaptation plan
                                              • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                              adaptation plan
                                              • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore

setting up a targeted adaptation
reporting power that could see some           Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Further comments                              A strong driver of anthropogenic global warming is outlined in the
                                              "Limits to Growth" (L2G) report published by the Club of Rome in
                                              1972. L2G describes a set of computer simulations of a future Earth.

                                              Its business-as-usual (BAU) projection predicts overshoot and
                                              collapse of the global economy, environment, and human population
                                              from about 2020 onwards. L2G’s central argument, rejected by most
                                              economists and politicians but self-evident to most scientists, is that
                                              growth within any closed system including the Earth’s closed

                                              biosphere is ultimately unsustainable and inevitably leads to
                                              overshoot and collapse. L2G’s BAU projection has accurately tracked
                                              40 years of subsequent statistical data collected by many
                                              international agencies, and accordingly should be taken very
                                              seriously. So too should the warning of a preeminent scientist in

                                              1954, at that time describing the existential threat posed by nuclear
                                              weapons that continues unabated today but equally applicable, in
                                              my view, to anthropogenic global overheating and to overshoot and
                                              collapse from about 2020 onwards.
