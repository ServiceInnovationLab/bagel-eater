A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          I believe we are guardians of this planet and have a great
because...                                    responsibility in taking care of it. In the ignorance of our past we took
                                              advantage of this responsibility and did a lot of damage to this

                                              planet. With modern day research we can no longer sit in that
                                              ignorance; we must act. Us as individuals can do what we can but
                                              when it comes to a macro level we need politicians to back our
                                              country's best interests.

                                              hope for her is to live on a planet that is taken care of with leaders
                                              that she can be inspired by. I hope that she will have the opportunity
                                              to have sustainable options of transport, food and other aspects of

                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to        • climate change policy (including emissions trading)

                                            I think expertise in public health is also important.
