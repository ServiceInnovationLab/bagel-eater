Q2. If the Government sets a 2050            The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net

New Zealand?

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its
targets?                                     By using domestic and commercial emissions

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow        The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if             changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require
Governments to set out plans within a        Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change
                                             Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan with clear
certain timeframe to achieve the             targets, outcomes and responsible people for implementing it.
emissions budgets?

Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider        The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
in setting plans to meet budgets? For        comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Further comments                             i think that we are late to the party on this work. this means that
                                             there is a social, economic and health imperative to act quickly and
                                             effectively.
                                             i think we should out provision in place to provide refuge for pacific
