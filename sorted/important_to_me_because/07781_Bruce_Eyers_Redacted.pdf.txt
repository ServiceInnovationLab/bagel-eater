A Zero Carbon Act is important to me         Even though we are a small country we need to be at the forefront of

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050            An ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to close to
target now, which is the best target for     zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                 ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                             we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases(CO2), while
                                             reducing short-lived gases (Methane)to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its          By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new

targets?                                     forest planting).That is not buying overseas credits.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow        The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic

the 2050 target to be revised if             changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the

Q5. The Government proposes that

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill       Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within

Q16. Should the Government explore

Further comments                             The previous carbon trading scheme was a farce with NZ buying
                                             dodgy credits from overseas.
                                             Over the last 25 years I have grown 3000 pinus radiata trees and

                                             own a Nissan Leaf.
                                             People say its too hard but I have been in carbon credit for decades.
                                             It can be done .Some say we cannot afford to make change but we
                                             cannot afford not too.
                                             Many places in the third world are reliant on snow melt for irrigation .
