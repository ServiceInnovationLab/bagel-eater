A Zero Carbon Act is important to me         For four decades I've researched and reported on the dangers of
because...                                   melting ice sheets melting from rising CO2 emissions and in the last
                                             two decades it's begun and accelerating. The best science says we

                                             can still save the ice sheets and reduce the damage done by rising
                                             sea levels and a stormier world but only if we act now. NZ can and
                                             should lead the way.

Q1. What process should the                  The Government should set a target for zero carbon emissions by
Government use to set a new emissions        2050 in legislation now, and empower a Climate Change Commission
reduction target in legislation?             to provide pathways and monitoring to ensure this is achieved.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050            The essential target, not just the best, is science-based and involves

New Zealand?                                 reducing shorter-lived gases like NO2 and CH4 to much reduced
                                             levels (50-30%) by that date.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its          By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                     forest planting).

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow        The 2050 target should not be weakened or reduced under any

                                             provision should eb made for the Commission to take this into
                                             account in its goal-setting.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years        yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be
in place at any given time. Do you agree     3 are in effect at all times.
with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to

to alter emissions budgets?                  “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.
                                             However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                             scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                             permitted.

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should
considerations that the Government and take the following factors into consideration when advising on and

the Climate Commission will need to          setting budgets:
take into account when advising on and       • scientific knowledge regarding climate change
setting budgets?                             • technology relevant to climate change
                                             • economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the
                                             economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the

                                             economy
                                             • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on
                                             taxation, public spending and public borrowing
                                             • social circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel
                                             poverty

                                             • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy
                                             supplies and
                                             the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require
Governments to set out plans within a        Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change
certain timeframe to achieve the             Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan.
emissions budgets?
Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider        The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be

in setting plans to meet budgets? For        comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and
example, who do we need to work with,        reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that        Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.
the Climate Change Commission advises
on and monitors New Zealand's                However, the Government should be legally required to consider and
progress towards its goals. Do you           formally respond to the Commission’s advice, and to provide an
                                             explanation if they do not act on it.
agree with these functions?

Q12. What role do you think the Climate      The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in
Change Commission should have in             the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to the
relation to the New Zealand Emissions
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?                     number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)

have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests
                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,

                                             insurance and local
                                             government
                                             • risk management
                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                             • community engagement and communications.

                                             • business competitiveness
                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology
                                             development system.

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill
should cover adapting to climate             Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within
                                             the Climate Commission.
change?

Q15. The Government has proposed a           I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance
number of new functions to help us           is required in terms of how local councils are involved:
adapt to climate change. Do you agree        • a national climate change risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan
                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national

                                             adaptation plan
                                             • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation
reporting power that could see some          Yes
organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
