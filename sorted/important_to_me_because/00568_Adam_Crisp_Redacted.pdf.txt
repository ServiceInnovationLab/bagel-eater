A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          without this NZ will not act at the rate it needs to set an example of

Q1. What process should the                   The Government should seek advice from the existing interim

                                              target beyond 2050 seriously jeopardise NZ's international image as
                                              an environmentally friendly and progressive nation.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             NZ needs to reduce long-lived (especially carbon dioxide and nitrous
target now, which is the best target for      oxide) greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050. Short-lived gases
New Zealand?                                  (especially methane) need to be reduced to sustainable levels as

                                              determined by scientific advice.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only. Any offsetting of

                                              historic NZ emissions show, previous planting efforts have not

                                              addressed the issue of reducing net emissions, as forests have been

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not change however the path to the target

                                              understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years         yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
                                              3 are in effect at all times. The cycles of the budgets need to be
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be     independent of the election cycles so that they do not become overly
in place at any given time. Do you agree      politicised.
with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to

                                              However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in

                                              scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                              permitted.
Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should
considerations that the Government and take the following factors into consideration when advising on and

the Climate Commission will need to          setting budgets:
take into account when advising on and       • scientific knowledge regarding climate change
setting budgets?                             • proven technology (BUT not technology development hopes)
                                             relevant to climate change
                                             • economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the

                                             economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the
                                             economy
                                             • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on
                                             taxation, public spending and public borrowing
                                             • social circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel

                                             • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy
                                             supplies and
                                             the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require      Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change
Governments to set out plans within a        Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan. And the
certain timeframe to achieve the             ability for the Climate Commission to reject a plan and ask for a

emissions budgets?                           revised one if the plan is not considered robust.

Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider        The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
in setting plans to meet budgets? For        comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and
example, who do we need to work with,        reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that
                                             Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body,
the Climate Change Commission advises        however it should have the power to highlight if a governnment is
on and monitors New Zealand's                not on-track to its commitments or if the proposed plan by the
progress towards its goals. Do you
agree with these functions?                  government is unlikely to achieve the stated targets.

Q12. What role do you think the Climate
Change Commission should have in             The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in
relation to the New Zealand Emissions        the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to the
                                             number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests

                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,
                                             insurance and local
                                             government
                                             • risk management

                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                             • community engagement and communications.
                                             • business competitiveness
                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology
                                             development system.


                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill       Yes, both are needed to ensure decisionmaking reflects the total cost
should cover adapting to climate             of climate change. This may require a separate adaptation sub-
change?                                      committee within the Climate Commission and will require separate
                                             expertise. This will ensure the total cost of a mitigation decision is
                                             recognised i.e. if mitigation is reduced than adaptation costs are

                                             likely to increase..
Q15. The Government has proposed a           I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance
number of new functions to help us           is required in terms of how local councils are involved:

adapt to climate change. Do you agree        • a national climate change risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan
                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                             adaptation plan
                                             • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation
                                             Yes as both climate change mitigation and adaptation need legal and
reporting power that could see some          policy support and consideration.
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Further comments                             An apolitical integrated approach across climate change mitigation
                                             and adaptation concerns is needed that excludes temporary
                                             emission reduction measures such as short-term planting, so the

                                             legislation needs to reflect all these aspects.
