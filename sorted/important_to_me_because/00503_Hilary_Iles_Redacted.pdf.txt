A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          Climate change was recognised as a global issue in the 1960s but
because...                                    there were too many people paid to produce evidence that it was not
                                              happening. And it is only now that changes are being made when the

                                              results of the changing climate are becoming more visible and
                                              devastating. We have a much greater and more urgent job to do now
                                              because of the delay in taking action. We need to act quickly and
                                              widely. I have children and grandchidren and am concerned about
                                              what the world will be like for them after we have ruined it, we need

                                              strong commited action NOW

Q1. What process should the                   The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now. They
Government use to set a new emissions         need to look at all the legitimate research and actions other
reduction target in legislation?              countries are taking. They need effective and speedy results to meet
                                              our climate change obligations. They need to set the outcomes and
                                              achieve these in the fastest most efficent ways.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for      zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to

New Zealand?                                  ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           Through setting industry targets - they should be leading the charge
targets?                                      to reduce emmisions particulary the farming industry which is the
                                              greatest contributor.The government needs to look at all sectors of

                                              the economy and calculate the % contribution to climate change and
                                              then all sectors must start at once to actively reduce thier
                                              emmissions.I think that we should be taking responsibility for our
                                              emmisions and not rely too much on emmissions trading.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the

circumstances change?                         ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                              understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years         yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be
in place at any given time. Do you agree      3 are in effect at all times.
with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

                                             • economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the
                                             economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the

                                             economy. It is inevitable that certain sectors of the economy will be
                                             significantly impacted and will need to change their practices - but
                                             there are more environmentally friendly climate change practices
                                             that they can adopt. And they need to adopt these as soon as
                                             possible

                                             Short term economic loss is worth it for long term environmental
                                             stability - We cannot continue with buisness as usual and the longer
                                             we put things off the greater the changes/losses will be because of

                                             climate change destruction.

                                             the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require
                                             Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change
Governments to set out plans within a        Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan. The time
certain timeframe to achieve the             frame should be short as we need to get on with action now.
emissions budgets?

Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider        The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
in setting plans to meet budgets? For        comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and

example, who do we need to work with,        reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that
the Climate Change Commission advises
on and monitors New Zealand's                Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.

agree with these functions?

Q12. What role do you think the Climate

Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour

expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests
                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,
                                             insurance and local

                                             government
                                             • risk management
                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                             • community engagement and communications.
                                             • business competitiveness

                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology
                                             development system.

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill
should cover adapting to climate             Definately yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-
change?                                      committee within the Climate Commission.
Q15. The Government has proposed a           I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance
number of new functions to help us           is required in terms of how local councils are involved:

adapt to climate change. Do you agree        • a national climate change risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan
                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                             adaptation plan
                                             • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation

reporting power that could see some          Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Further comments                             The government needs to spell out / educate the population in NZ
                                             about the seriousness of not doing anything about climate change -
                                             they need to emphasize the sea level rise impacts, the heavy storms
