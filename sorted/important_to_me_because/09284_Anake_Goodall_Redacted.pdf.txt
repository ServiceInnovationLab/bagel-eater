A Zero Carbon Act is important to me           This is - literally - the whole ball of wax, right?
because...
                                               If we have aspirations for the future, any aspirations at all, they are

                                               all rooted by definition in a sustainable, accommodating and
                                               enabling physical environment.

                                               This is humanity's biggest existential threat by far and we are, in my
                                               opinion, guilty of squandering precious time. Now is the time to act,

                                               and to be bold in our goals, and our actions!

Q1. What process should the                    We believe that the government should set a target for 2050 in
Government use to set a new emissions          legislation now; one that can't be slipped out of for political
reduction target in legislation?               expediency but one that can be amended appropriately (including
                                               bringing emissions targets forwards) to reflect new information and
                                               changing circumstances.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050              We support the adoption of the most ambitious target i.e. reducing
target now, which is the best target for       total greenhouse gases (including CO2 and methane) to net zero by

New Zealand?                                   2050 at the latest, and preferably earlier. We also support taking a
                                               science-based approach to ensure all efforts to reduce emissions are
                                               as impactful as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-
                                               lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels as
                                               a priority.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its            By using domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest

targets?                                       planting), and by simultaneously supporting global initiatives
                                               including in developing nations and especially our Pacific neighbours.

                                               climate; all effective initiatives should be encouraged and supported.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow          The 2050 target should not be altered in response to changes in
the 2050 target to be revised if               economic circumstances as this will undermine the long-term

circumstances change?                          certainty that is critical to the success of this work. However, the

                                               including especially the ability to bring targets froward if the
                                               emerging scientific evidence supports that.

Q5. The Government proposes that               We agree with the principle of establishing 5-year budgets set 10-15
