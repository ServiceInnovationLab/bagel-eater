A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          Climate change requires a global response, and global action. What
because...                                    country is better placed to lead the way than New Zealand? As a
                                              country with a relatively small population, abundant natural

                                              resources, stable government and strong economy, we have a
                                              responsibility to lead the way on climate response. If we can't do it,
                                              how can we expect the major players on the world stage to do it?
                                              This is New Zealand's time to lead by example and create something
                                              that all New Zealander's can be proud of for generations to come.

                                              This is NZ's 21st century 'nuclear free' moment. PLEASE don't let it
                                              slip by.

Q1. What process should the                   The Government should set a binding target for 2050 in legislation
Government use to set a new emissions         now, with cross-party support, so that target outlasts political
reduction target in legislation?              agendas and election cycles.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for      zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                  ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:

                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                      forest planting).

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. The only way to
circumstances change?                         having a meaningful, long-term positive impact on climate change is

                                              to set long-term targets that MUST be met. However, the ability to
                                              revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                              understanding or international agreements should be permitted. For
                                              example - if the target becomes extremely easy to meet due to
                                              scientific advances, then the target should be amended to become

                                              more ambitious.
Q5. The Government proposes that
                                              Yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
three emissions budgets of five years         3 are in effect at all times. This will help us track our progress
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be     towards the long-term 2050 goal, and make sure that this long-term
in place at any given time. Do you agree
with this proposal?                           target is met.

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to
to alter emissions budgets?                   “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.

                                              However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                              scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                              permitted.
Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:

Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Further comments                             I urge the NZ Government to be bold and take a strong stance on
                                             Climate Change. Don't take the easy road - if you do, your children

                                             failure to act with courage now. They will not thank you then, just as

                                             the millennial generation will not thank you now if you fail us on this.
