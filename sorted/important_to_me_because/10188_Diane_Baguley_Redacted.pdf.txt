A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          New Zealand has an international and regional responsibility to
because...                                    establish a sound legislative basis for the planning and control of
                                              emissions. We have relatively high per capita emissions and we are a

                                              Pacific nation where the impacts of climate change will be high. In
                                              addition, we are potentially exposed to negative impacts from our
                                              major markets in tourism and commodities based on our emissions
                                              performance. Our low absolute contribution to climate change will be
                                              no protection against such negative impacts.

Q1. What process should the                   The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now.

Government use to set a new emissions         Evidence-based information should be used to facilitate broad
reduction target in legislation?              support for the target so that the Government can maintain
                                              leadership for the target over time.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             We should set a target of total greenhouse gases to net zero by
target now, which is the best target for      2050. This will need goals for negative levels of long-lived gases,
New Zealand?                                  while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           We should take responsibility for our own emissions rather than
targets?                                      buying carbon credits, ie we should use domestic emissions

                                              reductions and offsets (such as new forest planting) only.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                         ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                              understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be     yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
                                              3 are in effect at all times.

with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able Not unless there are changes in scientific understanding or
to alter emissions budgets?                   international agreements. Consistency of targets is extremely
                                              important as a basis for planning by stakeholders including
                                              communities, infrastructure organisations, and the commercial and

Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider        The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be

in setting plans to meet budgets? For        comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and
example, who do we need to work with,        reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that        Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.
the Climate Change Commission advises
on and monitors New Zealand's                However, the Government should be legally required to consider and
progress towards its goals. Do you           formally respond to the Commission’s advice, and to provide an

Q12. What role do you think the Climate      The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)

have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)

                                             • community engagement and communications.

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill

Further comments                             There is a sense of momentum at present, including business leaders

                                             as well as community groups. I do not think that Government will
                                             have a better chance than now to establish a resilient legislative
                                             basis for planning action on our climate change commitments.
