A Zero Carbon Act is important to me           Climate change is the nexus of many challenges across both space
because...                                     and time. It is not just an environmental problem, but also a social,
                                               economic, health, security problem that requires nothing short of

                                               both top-down, ambitious targets and stringent regulations, as well
                                               as bottom-up advocacy, businesses and initiatives to solve. I have
                                               been studying and working on ways to tackle climate change globally
                                               since 2009. Ambitious political will, laws and stringent regulations
                                               have been proven to send strong signals to the market - triggering

                                               innovations and encouraging communities to accelerate transition to
                                               a post-carbon world. I have recently become a NZ resident and I feel
                                               strongly about this country I now call home to take the lead. A Zero
                                               Carbon Act is a way to do so but only if it is one that is ambitious, fair
                                               and with a strong implementation and enforcement mechanism. The

                                               whole world is watching.

Q1. What process should the                    The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now. One
Government use to set a new emissions          way of doing so is to combine scenario modelling with a backcasting
reduction target in legislation?               approach and stakeholders engagement. This is the process done by
                                               South Africa through the Long Term Mitigation Scenario (LTMS)
                                               exercise and adopted by various countries through the Mitigation

                                               Action Plans and Scenarios (MAPS) programme and in a simpler
                                               version, the Deep Decarbonisation Pathway Project (DDPP). It is
                                               important however to not drag on and on about what the process
                                               should be but to start right away - time is running out.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050              Reducing total greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050. It is the only
target now, which is the best target for       target that aligns with what the science tells us we need to do. I also
New Zealand?                                   support taking a science-based approach to ensure our efforts to

                                               reduce emissions are as impactful as possible: we should aim for
                                               negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases
                                               to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its            Reduce emissions from the largest emitting sectors locally as much
targets?                                       as possible and as quickly as possible without exporting emissions
                                               abroad i.e. importing highly carbon intensive products made

                                               elsewhere. Then, create carbon sinks locally that are regeneratively
                                               designed.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow          The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if               changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                          ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                               understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years
                                               Yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be      3 are in effect at all times.

with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to

                                               However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in

                                               scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                               permitted.
Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

the Climate Commission will need to          setting budgets:

                                             • economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the
                                             economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the

                                             economy
                                             • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on
                                             taxation, public spending and public borrowing

                                             the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require      Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change
Governments to set out plans within a
certain timeframe to achieve the             Act and specify a strict time frame for producing and updating a
emissions budgets?                           plan. The plan must be implementable and enforceable.

Q10. What are the most important             The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be

issues for the Government to consider        comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and
in setting plans to meet budgets? For        reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi. The Government needs
example, who do we need to work with,        to work with all sectors and all levels of the country as the Act
what else needs to be considered?            concerns everybody. This includes local councils, community groups,
                                             schools, businesses etc.

Q11. The Government has proposed that

the Climate Change Commission advises

progress towards its goals. Do you
agree with these functions?

Q12. What role do you think the Climate
Change Commission should have in             The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in
relation to the New Zealand Emissions        the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to the
                                             number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change and energy policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests

                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,
                                             insurance and local
                                             government
                                             • risk management

                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                             • community engagement, communications and negotiation
                                             • business competitiveness
                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology
                                             development system.


                                             I think expertise in public health is also important. In addition to this
                                             list of expertise, it is necessary for Climate Change Commissioners to
                                             have integrity and empathy.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill
should cover adapting to climate             Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within

Q15. The Government has proposed a          I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance
number of new functions to help us          is required in terms of how local councils are involved:

adapt to climate change. Do you agree       • a national climate change risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                • a national adaptation plan
                                            • regular review of progress towards implementing the national

                                            • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation

reporting power that could see some         Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
