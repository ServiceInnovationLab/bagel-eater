A Zero Carbon Act is important to me         New Zealand needs to join with other enlightened countries to
because...                                   respond to the multiple threats of climate disruption (aka "change")
                                             by taking tangible action to reduce greenhouses gases and become

                                             carbon-neutral by 2050 at the latest.

Q1. What process should the                  A legislative target of 2050 needs to be set as legally binding for

reduction target in legislation?

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050            I consider it essential to set an ambitious target to achieve zero net
target now, which is the best target for     carbon nationally by 2050. We need to achieve this using
New Zealand?                                 scientifically credible evidence, and following scientifically defensible
                                             advice - and to address reductions in both long-lived gases (to

                                             negative levels) and short-lived gases (to levels that are
                                             sustainable).

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its          I do not support carbon-credit trading as a means to achieve targets.
targets?                                     Rather, NZ needs to take tangible action to reduce our emissions,
                                             and to undertake planting of new forests - preferably of native trees
                                             including on erosion-prone land.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow        I think that revision of the 2050 target should be allowed only if there

the 2050 target to be revised if             is a change in the scientific understanding of climate disruption, or if
circumstances change?                        international agreements change. Reflecting the seriousness of
                                             current and future climate disruption, the agreed target must not be
                                             altered for economic reasons.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years        This is a sound way to proceed, as such a future-focused timeline
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be takes the commitment beyond any single government term, and

in place at any given time. Do you agree makes the direction clear for all parties.
with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able NZ Governments should not be able to alter the agreed 2050 target
to alter emissions budgets?                  unless circumstances as detailed in Q 4 (above) occur.

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I support the set of factor identified by Generation Zero for the
considerations that the Government and Government and Climate Commission to take into account when
the Climate Commission will need to          advising on and setting budgets:

take into account when advising on and       • scientific knowledge regarding climate change
setting budgets?                             • technology relevant to climate change
                                             • economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the
                                             economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the
                                             economy

                                             • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on
                                             taxation, public spending and public borrowing

                                             supplies and the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.
Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require      Yes. The issues and global implications are too important for

Governments to set out plans within a        governments to delay or defer plans to achieve emission targets. We

Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider        The Government need to fund research to achieve the best advice in
in setting plans to meet budgets? For        the setting ’of emission budgets - and such budgets need to be wide-
                                             ranging, set fairly, sustainable, cost-effective and demonstrating a
example, who do we need to work with,        commitment to the Treaty.
what else needs to be considered?
Q11. The Government has proposed that Yes. It is important that the Climate 'Disruption' Commission both
the Climate Change Commission advises monitors the country's progress towards 2050 targets and provides

on and monitors New Zealand's                advice to Government. Also that the Government has an obligation
progress towards its goals. Do you           to consider the Commission's advice and to respond formally and
agree with these functions?                  transparently to it.

Q12. What role do you think the Climate
Change Commission should have in             Advice should be the main function of the Climate 'Disruption'

Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?

Q13. The Government has proposed that In principle, I support the areas of expertise advocated as

Climate Change Commissioners need to         appropriate by Generation Zero, and summarised as follows:
have a range of essential and desirable      • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
expertise. Do you agree with the             • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour

                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,
                                             insurance and local
                                             government
                                             • risk management

                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                             • social science; community engagement and communications.
                                             • business competitiveness
                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology
                                             development system.


                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill       Yes, and this could be accommodated within the Climate 'Disruption'
should cover adapting to climate
change?                                      Commission as a separate section or sub-committee.

Q15. The Government has proposed a           Yes, I support the following functions:
number of new functions to help us           • a national climate change risk assessment
adapt to climate change. Do you agree        • a national adaptation plan

with the proposed functions?                 • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                             adaptation plan
                                             • an adaptation reporting power
                                             Local government involvement is also necessary to collectively
                                             contribute to these plans and reviews.

Q16. Should the Government explore

setting up a targeted adaptation
reporting power that could see some          This seems an appropriate suggestion.
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Further comments                             I advocate the use, as indicated above, of altered terminology to
                                             Climate "Disruption", rather than Climate Change - the latter looks

                                             like it was agreed to by a committee rather than appropriately
                                             describing the seriousness of the situation. Why perpetuate use of
                                             weak terminology for the most serious local and global
                                             environmental issue of our generation?
