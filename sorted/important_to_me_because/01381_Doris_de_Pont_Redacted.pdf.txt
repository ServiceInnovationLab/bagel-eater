A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          As the current Prime Minister has rightly identified this is our nuclear

                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years         yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
each ( covering the next 15 years) be in
place at any given time. Do you agree         3 are in effect at all times.

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori

have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests
                                             • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,

                                             insurance and local government

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill
should cover adapting to climate             Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation
reporting power that could see some          Yes
organisations share information on their
