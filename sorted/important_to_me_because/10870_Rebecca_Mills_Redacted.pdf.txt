A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          This is our 'nuclear free moment'. Now, more than any other time in
because...                                    history is it more important for New Zealand to build cross-party
                                              consensus and commit to this Zero Carbon Bill. The science is clear,

                                              achieving the Paris Agreement is not only necessary, it is possible.
                                              But it is also clear that for society to develop and prosper in a near-to
                                              2 °C world there must be a transformation to truly sustainable
                                              development.
                                              Decarbonising the economy by 2050 is not enough. We also need to

New Zealand?                                  ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new

targets?                                      forest planting).

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic

Q11. The Government has proposed that        Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.
the Climate Change Commission advises        However, the Government should be legally required to consider and

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)

proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests

                                             • community engagement and communications.

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.
