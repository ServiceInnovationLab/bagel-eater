A Zero Carbon Act is important to me           The Zero Carbon Act is important to me because a low carbon
because...                                     economy would have massive benefits, not only to the climate but
                                               also to the health of its people. The Zero Carbon Act has the ability

                                               to drive changes in business behaviour to think more ethically about
                                               emissions and environmental sustainability. The Zero Carbon Act will
                                               also have benefits on the health system. As a healthcare
                                               professional, I feel the Zero Carbon Act supports the notion of living a
                                               low carbon lifestyle which brings about improved health outcomes in

                                               New Zealand. There should be a large focus on the equity and a just
                                               transition so that it is fair on those who have less equity in New
                                               Zealand. Setting a target and an adaptation strategy supports
                                               decision making in the local councils and can bring about less stress
                                               on New Zealanders. The Act must also respect Te Tiriti to proactively

                                               protect Māori rights and interests over the interests of the Crown.

Q1. What process should the                    The government should set the target in law now, with the ability to

reduction target in legislation?               advice. The target should be based on the most up to date climate
                                               science, on our international obligations and on principles of global
                                               equity (New Zealand is a wealthy, high emitting country and should

                                               do its fair share).

                                               I firmly believe that NZ (businesses, local and regional councils, iwi,
                                               communities, whānau and households) need certainty and
                                               transparency to act fast now so that the implications of climate
                                               change can be mitigated.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050              The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net

target now, which is the best target for       zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                   ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                               we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                               short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its            Domestic net emissions reductions only (including from
targets?                                       reforestation, horticultural planting and improved soil health).

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow          The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic

the 2050 target to be revised if               changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                          ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                               understanding or international agreements should be permitted. The
                                               target can be altered to increase climate action.

Q5. The Government proposes that               Yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
three emissions budgets of five years          3 are in effect at all times.

in place at any given time. Do you agree Given the urgent need for global emissions to peak by 2020, the Act
with this proposal?                            could also include the requirement for the Commission to urgently
                                               set an initial 2-year Emissions Budget. This 2-year Budget would fit
                                               within the first 5-6 year Emissions Budget.

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to

                                               However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                               scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                               permitted.

                                               The Zero Carbon Act should also permit any Government to act so

                                               that New Zealand can emit less than budgeted if there new

Climate Change Commissioners need to           • climate change policy (including emissions trading)

                                               Public Health expertise must also be included, and it is essential that
                                               all Commissioners have equity expertise, and that equity issues are

                                               not marginalised. Finally, I consider that expertise in achieving social
                                               change is also important.

                                               It is important that vested interests are not part of the Commission,
                                               particularly those with a financial interest in maintaining the health-

                                               processes derailed by those who have a financial stake in continuing
                                               to do harm.

                                               The Commissioners should be sector experts, with a high level of
                                               standing in society.

Q15. The Government has proposed a             I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance

adapt to climate change. Do you agree          • a national climate change risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                   • a national climate adaptation plan

                                               • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                               adaptation plan
                                               • an adaptation reporting power

                                               Mitigation and adaptation are often deeply interlinked – so often

                                               mitigation and adaptation can be addressed together in the same
                                               policy (e.g. housing). But care must be taken in designing adaptation
                                               policies to ensure that climate-damaging emissions are not
                                               increased.


                                               Adaptation must be dealt with by a separate working group, to avoid
                                               distraction from the top priority of mitigation.

                                               A health adaptation plan must be put in place that covers both
                                               health sector adaptation and health-protecting adaptation in other

                                               sectors.
Q16. Should the Government explore             Yes
