A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          This epochal step is crucial in our work to stay engaged in the infinite
because...                                    yet crucial work of adaptive response and survival in the face of
                                              climate change. We as a nation have an opportunity to demonstrate

                                              active leadership in this area.

                                              As has been written by me and CA Cranston in A Cambridge Global

                                              We have an opportunity now to adapt and to grow to respond to the
                                              necessities of environmental justice in the same ways as many New
                                              Zealanders have responded to and supported a move towards Treaty

                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing

                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

                                              • community engagement and communications.
