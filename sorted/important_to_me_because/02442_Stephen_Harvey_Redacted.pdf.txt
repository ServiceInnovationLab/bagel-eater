A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          Climate change is currently the single most important issue facing
because...                                    the world that we know for a fact will have devastating
                                              consequences if we do not take significant and immediate action. I

                                              want to leave my children a planet that they can live on, and I want
                                              to feel proud as a New Zealander to be a citizen of a country that is
                                              putting its green credentials first and foremost. Being Zero Carbon as
                                              a country is quite literally the least we can do if we genuinely want to
                                              take our responsibilities as a member of the international community

                                              seriously.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             Reducing total greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050 is the
target now, which is the best target for      minimum target that makes any sense. Ideally we should be carbon
New Zealand?                                  negative. I also support taking a science-based approach to ensure
                                              our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible: we

                                              should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                      forest planting).

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic

                                              zero point forward to occur before 2050). However, the ability to

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.
