A Zero Carbon Act is important to me         It is already creating irreversible change to our planet and
because...                                   communities and the longer we leave it to take comprehensive
                                             action the less chance we will have to limit its effects.

Q1. What process should the

Government use to set a new emissions        Parliament should set a target for 2050 in legislation now.
reduction target in legislation?

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050            The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for     zero by 2050 or sooner. I also support taking a science-based
New Zealand?                                 approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its          By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new

targets?                                     forest planting).

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow        The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if             changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                        ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                             understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that             yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
three emissions budgets of five years        3 are in effect at all times. Each should be ambitious but realistic and
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be should be able to be increased if relevant new technologies are

in place at any given time. Do you agree developed before the period begins which would enable greater
with this proposal?                          emission reductions sooner.

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to
to alter emissions budgets?                  “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.
                                             However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                             scientific understanding or international agreements should be

                                             permitted.

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should
considerations that the Government and take the following factors into consideration when advising on and
the Climate Commission will need to          setting budgets:
take into account when advising on and       • scientific knowledge regarding climate change

                                             • economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the
                                             economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the
                                             economy
                                             • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on
                                             taxation, public spending and public borrowing

                                             • social circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel
                                             poverty and wider social inequalities
                                             • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy
                                             supplies and
                                             the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require
Governments to set out plans within a        Yes - there is no point setting targets without promptly adopting and

certain timeframe to achieve the             implementing a comprehensive plan to achieve them.
emissions budgets?

Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider        The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
in setting plans to meet budgets? For        comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and
example, who do we need to work with,        reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.

what else needs to be considered?
Q11. The Government has proposed that
the Climate Change Commission advises        Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.
                                             However, the Government should be legally required to consider and
on and monitors New Zealand's                formally respond to the Commission’s advice, and to provide an
progress towards its goals. Do you           explanation if they do not act on it.
agree with these functions?

Q12. What role do you think the Climate      The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in
Change Commission should have in             the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to the
relation to the New Zealand Emissions        number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?

                                             The commission should also be able to recommend that the ETS be
                                             replaced by more effective policy instruments e.g. Carbon tax.

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)

proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests
                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,
                                             insurance and local
                                             government

                                             • risk management
                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                             • community engagement and communications.
                                             • business competitiveness
                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology

                                             development system.

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill       Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within
should cover adapting to climate             the Climate Commission. Adaptation to climate change will require
change?                                      long term planning and consensus building and this should begin

                                             now.
Q15. The Government has proposed a           I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance

number of new functions to help us           is required in terms of how local councils are involved:
adapt to climate change. Do you agree        • a national climate change risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan
                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                             adaptation plan

                                             • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation             Yes. The public sector and large corporates should be mandated to
reporting power that could see some          report their climate change risks, and their plans to mitigate those
organisations share information on their risks including both adaptation and emission reduction measures
exposure to climate change risks?
