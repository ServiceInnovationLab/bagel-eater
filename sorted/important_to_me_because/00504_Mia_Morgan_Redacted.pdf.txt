A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          It is an urgent matter that needs to be addressed. As a kaitiaki of
because...                                    Aotearoa it is my duty to try and implement this law to make an
                                              impact to combat climate change. I have a connection to our whenua

                                              and our awa, Moana and all natural resources that Maori consider as
                                              taonga. If climate change is not addressed urgently we will force
                                              irreversible damage that will eliminate our resources. Present and
                                              future generations will no longer have taonga. Destruction will take
                                              place and everything will change, poverty will rise as well as disease

                                              and displacement of billions.

                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         I think the 2050 target should be revised to an earlier date. We might

                                              However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
