A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          It represents an incredible opportunity for NZ to really start to live up
because...                                    to the 100% pure branding and lead from the front. The only way we
                                              are going to have a significant impact on the climate outcome is to

                                              be an example to the rest of the world.

Q1. What process should the                   The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now. It

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for      zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                  ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing

                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By taking some forward thinking evidence based decisions and also
targets?                                      by not hiding behind the fact we can plant trees and pretend that is
                                              reducing emissions - we need to reduce emissions output wherever
                                              possible, not just the net figure.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the

                                              understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years         yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be
in place at any given time. Do you agree      3 are in effect at all times.
with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to

                                              However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                              scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                              permitted.

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed            I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

the Climate Commission will need to           setting budgets:
take into account when advising on and        • scientific knowledge regarding climate change
setting budgets?                              • technology relevant to climate change
                                              • economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the
                                              economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the

                                              economy
                                              • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on
                                              taxation, public spending and public borrowing
                                              • social circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel
                                              poverty

                                              • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy
                                              supplies and
                                              the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.

                                              Further to this the opportunity of creating new jobs, building a more

                                              resilient grid, reducing reliance on external market pressures around
                                              electricity generation etc. must all be put at the forefront of any
                                              decision. This situation represents a real opportunity for the country
                                              to really diversify its economy significantly.

emissions budgets?

Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider        The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
in setting plans to meet budgets? For        comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and
example, who do we need to work with,        reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that

the Climate Change Commission advises
on and monitors New Zealand's                Yes
progress towards its goals. Do you
agree with these functions?

Q12. What role do you think the Climate      The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in

relation to the New Zealand Emissions        those recommendations there should be some public declaration as
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?                     to the reasons why not.

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • engineering and/or infrastructure
have a range of essential and desirable      • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
expertise. Do you agree with the             • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
proposed expertise?                          markets and distribution)

                                             • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests
                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,
                                             insurance and local
                                             government

                                             • risk management
                                             • community engagement and communications.
                                             • business competitiveness
                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology
                                             development system.


                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill       Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within
should cover adapting to climate
change?                                      the Climate Commission.

Q15. The Government has proposed a           I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance
number of new functions to help us           is required in terms of how local councils are involved:

adapt to climate change. Do you agree        • a national climate change risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan
                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                             adaptation plan
                                             • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation

reporting power that could see some          Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Further comments                             Please take this opportunity to do more than have this little country
                                             doing its bit. We need to be leading from the front. It’s the right thing
                                             to do for the economy, for the country’s image and also the way we

                                             can make most positive impact in the world. Be ambitious for all our
                                             sakes, but especially my daughters. Let me know what part I can
                                             play and I will (I am an engineer).
