Q3. How should New Zealand meet its         By using domestic and international emissions reductions only

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow       The 2050 target should be able to be altered in response to major

                                            agreements should also be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able
to alter emissions budgets?                 Yes

emissions budgets?

Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider       The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
in setting plans to meet budgets? For
example, who do we need to work with,       comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable.
what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that
                                            Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.
the Climate Change Commission advises       However, the Government should be legally required to consider and
on and monitors New Zealand's               formally respond to the Commission’s advice, and to provide an
progress towards its goals. Do you
agree with these functions?                 explanation if they do not act on it.
Q12. What role do you think the Climate
Change Commission should have in             The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in
                                             the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to the
relation to the New Zealand Emissions        number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • climate and environmental science

                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,
                                             insurance and local
                                             government
                                             • risk management
                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure

                                             • community engagement and communications.
                                             • business competitiveness
                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.
