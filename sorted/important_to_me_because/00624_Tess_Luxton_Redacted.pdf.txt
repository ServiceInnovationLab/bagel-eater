A Zero Carbon Act is important to me         I have huge concern for the environment given the evidence/studies

                                             duty as selfish beings to do our part in reducing our damage. I do not

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050            The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net

New Zealand?                                 ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                             we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                             short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its          By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                     forest planting).

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow        The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years        yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill
should cover adapting to climate             Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within

Further comments                                If there is evidence that red meat gives bowl cancer why are we not
                                                taxing it like we are cigarettes? This red meat in my opinion is far

                                                worse for the environment in New Zealand than smoking has. I feel
                                                an obligation to personally try influence people to reduce or
                                                completely cut red meat out of their died for the future of New
                                                Zealand's sakes. If we do not act against this carbon emissions
                                                produced from our cattle beasts then we have no right to tax

                                                cigarettes due to the cancers produced from the consumption of red
                                                meat and the huge amount CO2 produced the red meat we produce
                                                in our country is wrong if we do not do anything to combat these
                                                effects it is having on our bodies and environment it baffles me that
                                                we aren't taxing it already! not to completely illuminate it from our

                                                lives and from the New Zealand economy this tax may just reduce
                                                the amount we produce and the amount we consume therefore
                                                making our bodies and environment healthier. We as a whole world
                                                are currently struggling to provide everyone with significant water,
                                                which could be combatted by reducing cattle beasts which is proven
