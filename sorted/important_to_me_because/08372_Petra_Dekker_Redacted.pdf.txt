A Zero Carbon Act is important to me           I am very concerned about the future of my children, their children
because...                                     and all future generations in New Zealand and globally. We need to
                                               make sure we adapt and mitigate the effects of climate change to

                                               ensure the survival of our species and all living creatures on our
                                               planet. Over the past 20 years I have noticed the changes in our
                                               climate globally and especially in NZ. The "once in 100 years"
                                               weather events occur more frequent now. At the start of this year we
                                               had two main weather events in my area (Tasman district), a major

                                               flood and a cyclone that had devastating, long lasting effects. People
                                               lost homes and biodiversity got lost, changing the environment
                                               drastically. Here in Ruby Bay it doesn't look the same anymore. The
                                               uncertainty and anxiety if and when such an event might happen
                                               again are very real and people here feel less safe. Tourists used to

                                               come to this area for its beauty but roads, cycle ways, beach fronts,
                                               campsites have been badly damaged, leaving councils (and
                                               ratepayers) with high costs of repair. Still, it will take a long time for
                                               nature to restore if at all possible. The community is confronted with
                                               its effects daily. Also, local orchards and produce growers were badly

                                               affected with crop damage and losses, which caused price inflation
                                               to the consumers.
                                               We need strong, brave leadership, from our Government to reduce
                                               our overall fossil fuel emissions. Significant price increases for fossil
                                               fuel emissions for all private and commercial users are needed to

                                               start making the transition towards renewable energy.
                                               My biggest concern is that the big commercial companies, like
                                               aviation and shipping industries but also tourism and agriculture, get
                                               exempt of these measures. Just single contributions from the people
                                               are not enough to create the urgent change that's needed. We can't

                                               keep growing our economy at the expense of nature. Without nature
                                               there is no economy at all. It needs a change of mindset for all of us
                                               and only Government can lead. Don't wait for more disasters to
                                               happen.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050              The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net

New Zealand?                                   ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                               we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                               short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its            By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                       forest planting).

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow          The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if               changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the

                                               understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to

                                             However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                             scientific understanding or international agreements should be

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

Q10. What are the most important

example, who do we need to work with,        reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.

Further comments                             Changing our mindset to using less fossil fuels won't be easy for
                                             anybody, but we'll have to do it and it has to happen urgently. We're
                                             all in this together. There is no planet B !
