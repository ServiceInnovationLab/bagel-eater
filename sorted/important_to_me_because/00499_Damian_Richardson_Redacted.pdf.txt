A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          A zero carbon act is important because the more time passes, the
because...                                    clearer the science is on climate change.


                                              There has been rhetoric here that NZ does not need to lead on the
                                              matter of climate change. I think this needs to be addressed where
                                              the rhetoric instead states that NZ can't afford to be left behind
                                              when dealing with climate change. The opportunities are vast and I
                                              would like our future economy to realise them.

Q1. What process should the                   The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now. The

Government use to set a new emissions         government needs as much cross party support as possible, and the
reduction target in legislation?              government needs a huge focussed PR campaign on why they are
                                              doing this. There are some good global warming slogans from
                                              prominant scientists, and the government should use these. Now is
                                              the time that if a government resounds climate science, the public

                                              will listen.
Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The planet is out of energy balance by 0.7 watts per/m2. It is now

target now, which is the best target for      impossible to avoid serious consequences of climate change. This is
New Zealand?                                  loss of property through sea level rise and weather related events,
                                              species extinction and decreased food production.

                                              But losing 10% of our species this century is better than 40% or

                                              more. A one metre sea level rise this century is better than multiple
                                              metre sea level rise *James Hansen.

                                              Restoring the Earths energy balance this century was an option
                                              several years ago, but but it is very unlikely now. But to give future

                                              generations the opportunity to restore energy balance somewhere
                                              not far out from a century, we would need to aim for carbon
                                              nuetrality by 2050. Being on a path where we won't be carbon

                                              generations a changing climate that they can't take action on, it is

                                              out of their control.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                      forest planting).

                                              The National party makes welfare dependency an issue, yet set NZ
                                              up for international dependency by carbon offsets, buying offshore

                                              carbon credits. This should not be allowed as we should not be a
                                              nation caught in carbon dependency.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                         ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                              understanding should be permitted. The trend on scientific
                                              understanding is going in one direction, the effects of climate change

                                              are happening sooner than previously modelled. So there should be
                                              room for the Bill to be revised.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be     yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to
to alter emissions budgets?                  “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty. NZ

                                             businesses need that certainty.

                                             However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                             scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                             permitted.

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

                                             economy
                                             • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on

agree with these functions?

Q12. What role do you think the Climate
Change Commission should have in             The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests

                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.
