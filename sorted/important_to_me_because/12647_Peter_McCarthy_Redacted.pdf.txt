A Zero Carbon Act is important to me            Climate change has become the biggest concern in my life. This is
because...                                      now constantly in my mind and has been escalating for the last 10
                                                years since I was introduced to the fact in a course at UoC. We are in

                                                this situation because we are out of control and we cannot agree to
                                                respect this beautiful world we live in. We have been greedy,
                                                neglectful and totally disrespectful.
                                                Experts such as French scientist Claude Lorius and his work in the
                                                Antarctic, have been instrumental in the discovery and interpretation

                                                of the palaeo-atmosphere information within ice cores. He was able
                                                to measure temperature from the distant past and saw climate of
                                                distant past by the air bubbles stored in deep ice. Movie: La glace et

                                                Science experts have amassed mountains of irrefutable evidence to

                                                support the fact that we need to prevent the world from warming but
                                                we choose not to.
                                                Why? Because it will take us out of our comfort zone. When I say we
                                                – it is the western world that is strangling our planet. In any given
                                                year about 6% of the world’s population fly in an aircraft? That 6%

                                                are the chosen few, the voracious consumers of fossils fuels. That
                                                equates to 3.5 billion passengers flying in aircraft in 2015 and it is
                                                increasing.
                                                This is shameful. Countries like Kiribati, China, Vietnam, Japan and
                                                Netherlands India, Bangladesh, will be the first countries to

                                                experience sea level rise that will significantly affect their
                                                populations. Add to that the cars and trucks on the road and the
                                                ships on the ocean.
                                                Add to that we are still choosing to burn coal to heat cities. Why -
                                                because coal is cheap and still seen as efficient. I want to see a world

                                                where people agree then demonstrate and commit to STOP USING
                                                FOSSIL FUELS.
                                                The evidence of climate change is clear. The Intergovernmental
                                                Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was created in 1988. Its contribution
                                                to understanding climate change has been fundamental to creating

                                                global agreements on common goals, the last of which is the Paris
                                                Agreement. The Paris Agreement aims to strengthen the global
                                                response to the threat of climate change, including by holding the
                                                increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 ºC above
                                                pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature

                                                increase to 1.5 ºC above pre-industrial levels. Governments agreed
                                                to set Nationally Determined Contributions to reach this goal, which
                                                will be reviewed regularly.
                                                Will we get there or has the horse bolted. We see the effect of
                                                warmer seas starting to erode the ice selves. Larsen A and B on the
                                                Antarctic peninsular have gone and Larsen C is next. These are the

                                                plugs in the bath. Once they break up the glaciers flow like giant taps
                                                directly into the ocean creating global sea level rise. Other ice
                                                shelves and glacier are destabilising such as the Greenland ice cap
                                                and the Thwaites Glacier and Pine Island Glacier in western
                                                Antarctica. If the planet continues to warm so do the oceans and

                                                they melt the underside of the ice shelves and they collapse and
                                                glaciated rivers runneth into the ocean.
                                                This is not going to be easy and will impact every facet of our lives.
                                                Technology will help but its not the panacea. The one thing we must
                                                do is LEAVE FOSSIL FUELS IN THE GROUND.

                                              clarity, and long-term certainty.

                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing

                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                      forest planting). The Zero Carbon Act should be met through
                                              Domestic emissions reductions only. Relying on international carbon
                                              credits creates ambiguity about what reductions need to be achieved
                                              in NZ. It also means we are investing in other countries’ low emission

                                              transitions, rather than our own. Look after our own back yard first
                                              and set an example to the rest of the world.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should NOT be altered in response to 'economic

Q5. The Government proposes that

                                              in advance so that 3 budgets are in effect at all times, at a level

agree with these functions?                   The Commission should not be a decision-making body, for the
                                              following reasons:
                                              • Democratic accountability: Elected officials should be ultimately
                                              responsible for making plans and meeting Zero Carbon Act targets. If
                                              they mess up, we vote them out. The Commission, in contrast, is not

                                              democratically elected or accountable to the public. Similarly, the
                                              government should not be able to ‘pass the buck’ on difficult
                                              decisions to the Commission. The Commission should provide expert
                                              advice, but it is the government that must take responsibility.


                                              • Compromised watchdog: A Commission with decision-making
                                              powers will be a less effective watchdog. It would have a conflict of
                                              interest in holding itself to account over its own policy decisions.

                                              economy will require comprehensive and coordinated policies across
                                              all sectors of the economy. The government needs to assume overall

                                              I think expertise in public health is also important.
