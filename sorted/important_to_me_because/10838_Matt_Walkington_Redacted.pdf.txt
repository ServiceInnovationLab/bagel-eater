A Zero Carbon Act is important to me           Climate change and ocean acidification are clear and present threats
because...                                     to
                                               1) the lives and well-being of billions of people alive now and

                                               generations who will live in the future
                                               2) the natural world on planet Earth
                                               3) the continuation of a large fraction of the species on the planet
                                               4) human civilisation
                                               Urgent steps must be taken to transform the world economies to

                                               carbon neutrality, to stabilise the climate, and eventually to restore
                                               atmospheric carbon concentration to pre-industrial levels.

                                               The climate change reality is:


                                               1) Human cause climate change has been detectable for many
                                               decades and known about for over a century.

                                               2) Abrupt climate change is a real risk and may be here now.


                                               3) Storage of heat in the oceans means further climate change is
                                               inevitable for decades even if human greenhouse gas emissions
                                               were to drop immediately to zero.

                                               4) The expected consequences (some horrific) of climate change and

                                               ocean acidification are arriving now.

                                               5) Human influence to date implies 1000 years or more of changed
                                               climate.

                                               we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                               short-lived gases to sustainable levels.


                                               In addition, we should eventually aim for negative emissions of
                                               methane as soon as technological or other change makes it possible.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its            By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                       forest planting).

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow          The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic

                                              In addition, the following factors should also be taken into account:

Q11. The Government has proposed that         Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.

                                              However, the Commission should be responsible to report on the
                                              effectiveness of the NZ ETS and to advise on policy changes that

                                              would improve the NZ ETS and on other policy measures that could
                                              augment or replace the NZ ETS, such as a fee and dividend scheme.
Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to          • climate change policy (including emissions trading)

have a range of essential and desirable       • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour

                                              • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,

                                              • community engagement and communications.

                                              I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill        Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within

                                              Also, consideration should be given to establishing an entirely

Further comments                              I would prefer that the Climate Change Commission was set up with
                                              a different structural model. The Commission should be a body of
                                              technical experts as proposed but there should also be a citizens'
                                              jury that is convened periodically to deliberate and decide on the

                                              major recommendations of the Commission. The Commission would
                                              have the option to revise its recommendations on the basis of the
                                              jury's findings. The government would then decide on the basis of
                                              both the Commission's recommendations and the findings of the
                                              citizens' jury.


                                              I would also prefer the NZ ETS to be scrapped in favour of a fee and
                                              dividend scheme with high and increasing prices on anthropogenic
                                              emissions of carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane.
