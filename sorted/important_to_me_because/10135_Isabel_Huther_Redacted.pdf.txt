New Zealand?                                 ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:

                                             we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its          By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)

                                             I think expertise in finance, insurance and public health is also

                                             important. Especially consideration should be given to ensuring
