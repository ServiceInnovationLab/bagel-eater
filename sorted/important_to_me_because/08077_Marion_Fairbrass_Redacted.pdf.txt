A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          I am concerned about the impact on people which is already
because...                                    occurring because of climate change. It is causing hardship to many
                                              people and in some cases causing them to lose their homes, their

                                              lives, their ability to grow crops and in some cases their island
                                              country. It is the most vulnerable in our world who will be impacted
                                              first, followed by the most vulnerable in our own country.

Q1. What process should the                   The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now.
Government use to set a new emissions         Taking this step now will give sufficient time for planning for realistic
reduction target in legislation?              mitigation and adaptation. We need certainty of goals in order to

                                              have robust plans.
Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net

target now, which is the best target for      zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                  ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                      forest planting).

                                              Using international carbon credits is avoiding the responsibility to
                                              fully do what we can to achieve our goals.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. There is going
circumstances change?                         to be a financial cost but the cost of not acting responsibly will be
                                              greater. However, the ability to revise the 2050 target in light of

                                              major changes in scientific understanding or international
                                              agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that              Yes - I agree with 5-year budgets so that it is clear what is expected
three emissions budgets of five years         within a stated time frame. If these 5 year budgets are made 10-15
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be
in place at any given time. Do you agree      years in advance a clearer way forward will be there for those
with this proposal?                           needing to plan changes.

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to

to alter emissions budgets?                   “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.
                                              However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                              scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                              permitted.

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed            I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

the Climate Commission will need to           setting budgets:
take into account when advising on and        • scientific knowledge regarding climate change
setting budgets?                              • technology relevant to climate change
                                              • economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the
                                              economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the

                                              economy
                                              • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on
                                              taxation, public spending and public borrowing
                                              • social circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel
                                              poverty

                                              • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy
                                              supplies and
                                              the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.
Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require
Governments to set out plans within a        Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change

certain timeframe to achieve the             Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan.
emissions budgets?

Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider        The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
in setting plans to meet budgets? For        comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and
example, who do we need to work with,        reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.

the Climate Change Commission advises However there needs to be a mechanism put in place which means
on and monitors New Zealand's                that future governments cannot just ignore what the Commission
progress towards its goals. Do you           says. If the commission is going to be a watchdog and keep the
agree with these functions?                  governments on task in this matter, they need some teeth.

Q12. What role do you think the Climate
Change Commission should have in             The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in
                                             the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to the
relation to the New Zealand Emissions        number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests

                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,
                                             insurance and local
                                             government
                                             • risk management

                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                             • community engagement and communications.
                                             • business competitiveness
                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology
                                             development system.


                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill       Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within
should cover adapting to climate
change?                                      the Climate Commission.

Q15. The Government has proposed a           I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance
number of new functions to help us           is required in terms of how local councils are involved:

adapt to climate change. Do you agree        • a national climate change risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan
                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                             adaptation plan
                                             • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation

reporting power that could see some          Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Further comments                             I believe it is vital that whatever Act is passed, that it is with cross
                                             party agreement so that it is not chopped and changed with any
                                             change in political power.
