A Zero Carbon Act is important to me           Climate change is an international issue which will most affect those
because...                                     who have contributed to the problem the least. I have been to some
                                               of the communities and spoken to some of the people - in

                                               Bangladesh and Mongolia - who will be most severely affected by
                                               climate change even though they carry a fraction of the blame we do
                                               for causing it. We therefore have an opportunity, and indeed a moral
                                               obligation, to lead the world towards a clean and renewable future.
                                               Even though New Zealanders will be affected far less than the

                                               world's poorest (especially coastal) people, we will indirectly carry
                                               their burden too when they start coming here as refugees en masse
                                               from the Pacific Islands and around the world. In Bangladesh alone,
                                               30 million people are expected to be displaced with just one metre of
                                               sea level rise.

Q1. What process should the                    The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now and

Government use to set a new emissions          this target should be enforceable by law upon any government in
reduction target in legislation?               power. Climate change is apolitical and knows no borders therefore
                                               our response to it must also be apolitical, global, and collective.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050              The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for       zero by 2050, if not earlier. I also support taking a science-based
New Zealand?                                   approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its            By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                       forest planting). The government needs to close the Emissions
                                               Trading Scheme loopholes used by polluters to offset their credits
                                               with cheap foreign credits whose legitimacy are questionable. Plus,
                                               as a matter of principle, local pollution should be offset with local

                                               initiatives.

                                               The government should also establish an innovation fund specifically
                                               for businesses and individuals using technology to solve contributors
                                               to climate change.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow          The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic

the 2050 target to be revised if               changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                          ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                               understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be      Yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
in place at any given time. Do you agree       3 are in effect at all times.

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to

                                               However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                               scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                               permitted.
Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

the Climate Commission will need to          setting budgets:

                                             economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the

                                             economy
                                             • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on
                                             taxation, public spending and public borrowing

Q10. What are the most important             The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be

issues for the Government to consider        comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and
in setting plans to meet budgets? For        be done in a way which encourages the active participation and
example, who do we need to work with,        promotion from celebrities, community leaders, big business, and
what else needs to be considered?            iwi.

Q11. The Government has proposed that
the Climate Change Commission advises        Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.
                                             However, the Government should be legally required to consider and

progress towards its goals. Do you           explanation if they do not act on it.
agree with these functions?

Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?                     number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:

Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • climate and environmental science
                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,

                                             insurance and local
                                             government
                                             • risk management
                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                             • community engagement and communications

                                             • business competitiveness
                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology
                                             development system.

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill

Q15. The Government has proposed a           I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance
number of new functions to help us           is required in terms of how local councils are involved:

with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan
                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national

                                             • an adaptation reporting power
Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation

reporting power that could see some       Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
