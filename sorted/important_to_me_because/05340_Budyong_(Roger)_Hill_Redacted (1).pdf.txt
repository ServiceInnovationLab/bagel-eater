A Zero Carbon Act is important to me           A Zero Carbon Act is more than just important to me. I believe it is
because...                                     CRITICAL to achieve carbon zero by 2050 and a Zero Carbon Act and
                                               Climate Commission seem to be the best means of achieving this

                                               goal. Those of us alive now owe it to our descendants to get this
                                               right. The consequences of getting it wrong are highly likely to be
                                               disastrous for them and life in general on our beautiful planet. I wish
                                               to commend the Generation Zero group for the thoroughness and
                                               dedication they have brought to this essential task of raising public

                                               awareness and identifying realistic solutions for us all to strive for. In
                                               particular, I fully support their focus on the four core principles of
                                               Fairness, Cost Effectiveness, Comprehensiveness and Environmental
                                               Sustainability as an overarching guide to how we proceed with the
                                               task at hand.

Q1. What process should the                    The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now.

Government use to set a new emissions
reduction target in legislation?               We must aim high. The community need a very clear signal that we
                                               are faced with a crisis if we don't tackle this challenge full on.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050              The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for       zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                   ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                               we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing

                                               short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

                                               I wish to highlight and support the Generation Zero "two baskets"
                                               approach, which means taking a scientific approach to different
                                               gases. It does not mean treating the agricultural sector differently

                                               from other sectors. Nitrous oxide, which is primarily emitted through
                                               agricultural practices, is a long-lived greenhouse gas. It absolutely
                                               must be reduced to net zero. The science is clear that methane
                                               emissions must also be reduced. However, it is simply not necessary
                                               to reduce methane to net zero to stop global warming.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its            By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new

targets?                                       forest planting).

                                               Again I say we must aim high. I do not support purchasing
                                               international carbon credits as a means of reaching our targets. We
                                               are a wealthy resourceful nation which has an obligation to the fellow

                                               inhabitants of our one and only planet to lead by example. If there
                                               are international credits available that have integrity then they
                                               should be used to assist third world countries to meet their targets
                                               and if necessary funded through aid from richer countries. We're all
                                               in this together and we all will reap the consequences together if we

                                               don't support each other to reach carbon zero for the whole planet as
                                               soon as possible.
Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow          The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if               changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the

circumstances change?                          ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                               understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

                                               Economic reasons are used regularly to avoid taking important
                                               actions necessary to maintain the environmental integrity of our

                                               planet and the ecosystems that keep it liveable for us and other
                                               lifeforms. Our thinking is all wrong and our processes for measuring
                                               GDP and "growth" that ignore the environmental costs are very short
                                               sighted and selfish. We must change this approach or we are
                                               doomed.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years          yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
                                               3 are in effect at all times.
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be
in place at any given time. Do you agree       This is essential. No fudging for economic reasons please.
with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to
to alter emissions budgets?                    “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.
                                               However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in

                                               scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                               permitted.

                                               Also in a situation of an extreme natural disaster targets may need
                                               to be revised providing the overall target of carbon zero by 2050 is

                                               maintained.

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed             I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should
considerations that the Government and take the following factors into consideration when advising on and
the Climate Commission will need to            setting budgets:
take into account when advising on and         • scientific knowledge regarding climate change
setting budgets?                               • technology relevant to climate change

                                               • economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the
                                               economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the
                                               economy
                                               • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on
                                               taxation, public spending and public borrowing
                                               • social circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel

                                               poverty
                                               • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy
                                               supplies and
                                               the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.


                                               The three government objectives for climate change policy of
                                               building a sustainable economy, taking leadership in a global and
                                               local context and creating a just and inclusive society must be kept
                                               in focus at all times.

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require        Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change
Governments to set out plans within a          Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan.

certain timeframe to achieve the
emissions budgets?                             We know without a doubt that some governments will put off setting
                                               the plans for achieving emissions budgets if it is not set in law. Again
                                               no fudging please. A six month time limit is adequate.

Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider          The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be

in setting plans to meet budgets? For          comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and
example, who do we need to work with,          reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
what else needs to be considered?
Q11. The Government has proposed that Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.
the Climate Change Commission advises

on and monitors New Zealand's                An important aspect of the Commission's task is as a public
progress towards its goals. Do you           watchdog. It would therefore have a conflict of interest in holding
agree with these functions?                  itself to account over its own policy decisions if it had a decision
                                             making role.

Q12. What role do you think the Climate
Change Commission should have in             The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in
relation to the New Zealand Emissions        the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to the
                                             number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests

                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,
                                             insurance and local
                                             government
                                             • risk management

                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                             • community engagement and communications.
                                             • business competitiveness
                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology
                                             development system.


                                             I think expertise in public health is also important and should be
                                             added to this list.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill       Yes.
should cover adapting to climate
change?                                      This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within the

                                             Climate Commission.
Q15. The Government has proposed a           I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance

number of new functions to help us           is required in terms of how local councils are involved:
adapt to climate change. Do you agree        • a national climate change risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan
                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                             adaptation plan

                                             • an adaptation reporting power

                                             The issue of local government involvement needs clarification. LGNZ
                                             has produced an excellent Climate Change policy and a significant
                                             number of mayors have signed their declaration which is

                                             commendable. Unfortunately, in our case in Marlborough, there
                                             appears to be an element of signing the document to look as if we're
                                             doing the right thing but there does not appear to be corresponding
                                             actions at the policy level in particular in regard to taking mitigation
                                             measures. Councils need to be encouraged in every way possible to

                                             make their contribution to meeting our targets.

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation
reporting power that could see some          Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Further comments                                Thankyou for the opportunity to contribute to this important process.
                                                In particular I wish to thank the current government for having the

                                                foresight to see the seriousness of the situation we are faced with
                                                and the guts to take this course of action. I'm convinced that the
                                                majority of NZer's are supportive and any pressure from vested
                                                interests to dilute what has to be done needs to be resisted. I look
                                                forward to seeing how the final Zero Carbon Act evolves.
