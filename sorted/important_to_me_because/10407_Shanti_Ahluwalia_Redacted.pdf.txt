A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          I would like to speak to my submission if possible.
because...
                                              A Zero Carbon Act is important to me because it is a huge step

                                              forward in taking action against climate change, and provides
                                              tangible evidence to our overseas partners that we are taking action.

Q1. What process should the                   The Government should set a target in legislation now. 2050 seems
Government use to set a new emissions         to be the consensus date, but the process should also emphasise
reduction target in legislation?              decreasing emissions as soon as possible (as it will have a greater
                                              effect the sooner they are reduced).

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The target needs to include methane. It would be absurd to exclude
target now, which is the best target for      nearly 50% of our emissions.

New Zealand?
                                              The most ambitious target is best: reducing total greenhouse gases
                                              to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach
                                              to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as
                                              possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases in the

                                              long-term, with swift reduction of short-lived gases for immediate
                                              impact.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                      forest planting). The government should also invest heavily in the
                                              high-tech manufacturing sector (to ensure our economic
                                              development moves away from emission-intensive industries).

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic

the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                         ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                              understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

                                              In particular, it should be possible to bring the date *forward,* for an

                                              earlier target.
Q5. The Government proposes that

three emissions budgets of five years         yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be     3 are in effect at all times.
in place at any given time. Do you agree
with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to
to alter emissions budgets?                   “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.

                                              However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                              scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                              permitted.

                                              And as above, the government should be able to create budgets that

                                              reduce emissions even more than the targets.
Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should
considerations that the Government and take the following factors into consideration when advising on and

the Climate Commission will need to          setting budgets:
take into account when advising on and       • scientific knowledge regarding climate change
setting budgets?                             • technology relevant to climate change
                                             • social circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel
                                             poverty

                                             • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy
                                             supplies and
                                             the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.

                                             I do not agree that the commission should consider the economy

                                             directly. What needs to happen with our emissions is a scientific
                                             need, not an economic one. Instead, the commission should have an
                                             additional role of providing advice of ways to meet the budget, but
                                             the budget itself should not be constrained by economic
                                             considerations.

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require

Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider        The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
in setting plans to meet budgets? For        comprehensive, fair, environmentally sustainable, and reflect a
example, who do we need to work with,        commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.

what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that        Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.

Q12. What role do you think the Climate

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
