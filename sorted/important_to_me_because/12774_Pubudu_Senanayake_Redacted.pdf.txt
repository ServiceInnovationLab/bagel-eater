A Zero Carbon Act is important to me           Our future is at stake. Climate change is one of the largest threats to
because...                                     humanity, and life on the planet - it is the largest threat to a fairer
                                               world, and it is the largest threat to the indigenous peoples of earth.

                                               This law will enable us to do our part in shaping the solutions for the
                                               greatest battle humanity faces. This law will allow us to push our
                                               allies and partners towards greater action, by setting an example of
                                               what good policy looks like, by setting an example through action,
                                               and by coming together to do it without politicking, partisanship, and

                                               petty bickering.

                                               It is important because it is the first step in the right direction to
                                               make sure our pacific brothers and sister have homes, to make sure
                                               our tamariki have a thriving future, to ensure that we do not leave a

                                               world charred beyond recognition, and to make sure that our most
                                               vulnerable people do not bear yet another burden for the rest of us.

Q1. What process should the                    The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now. This

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050              The most ambitious target: We must reduce total greenhouse gases
target now, which is the best target for       to net zero by 2050 or earlier. To do so we should treat different
New Zealand?                                   gases, and different sources differently.


                                               CO2 and other long lived gases should be reduced as rapidly as
                                               possible to net zero.

                                               Methane and other short lived gases should be stabilized at a level

                                               lower than the present emissions level. The stable level should be
                                               determined by figuring out the atmospheric concentration of
                                               methane that will lead to an acceptable warming level, and then
                                               computing the stable emission level of methane that will drive the
                                               atmospheric concentration of methane to the appropriate level.

                                               Baseline comparisons based on a point in time (e.g. methane levels
                                               compared to 1990 levels) should not be used, as these do not reflect
                                               the overall warming effect of the gas in the atmosphere (for that a
                                               pre-industrial baseline would have to be used).


                                               Furthermore, emissions from fossil sources and biological sources
                                               should have their own budgets. Emissions from fossil sources need to
                                               reduce as much as possible, and biological sources can be offset via
                                               biological sinks. Any remaining fossil emissions can be offset with
                                               appropriate biological sinks, with appropriate compensation into the

                                               biological system.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its            By using domestic emissions reductions and sequestration methods
targets?                                       only. We should not be using international credits to meet our
                                               domestic obligations. However, they can be used to meet our
                                               international obligations.


                                               However, if we are on the most ambitious reduction pathway, such
                                               an eventuality it unlikely to arise.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow          The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
