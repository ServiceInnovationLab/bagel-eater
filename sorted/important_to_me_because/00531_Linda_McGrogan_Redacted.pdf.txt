A Zero Carbon Act is important to me         I have a 3 year old great granddaughter. She may well still be alive
because...                                   in 2100. Unless we all take some serious steps now to reduce our
                                             emissions I fear she will end her days in a very unpleasant world.

Q1. What process should the

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050            The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net

New Zealand?                                 ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                             we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                             short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its          By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new

targets?                                     forest planting).

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow        The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic

Q5. The Government proposes that

each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be    yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that

Further comments                             We need real action, now, not just more talk. As an example, we are

                                             from the aircraft bringing them here, and from the buses, camervans
                                             and cars in which they travel around our country. We need to
                                             acknowledge that changes must be made.
