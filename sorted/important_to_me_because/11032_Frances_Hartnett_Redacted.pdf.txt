A Zero Carbon Act is important to me         I want a better world for my children and grandchildren. New
because...                                   Zealand can show leadership in this area. We have gone blindly on
                                             using unsustainable agricultural practices which need to be halted

                                             now so that we can have a better future.

Q1. What process should the
Government use to set a new emissions        The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now.
reduction target in legislation?

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050            The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for     zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                 ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                             We should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing

                                             short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its          By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                     forest planting).

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow        The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if             changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                        ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                             understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years        No. 5 year budgets are too long. Scientific information informing this
                                             is changing rapidly. We should be looking at annual carbon budgets
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be    to be publicly notified. This could be 12 annual budgets in place at

with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to
to alter emissions budgets?                  “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.
                                             However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in

                                             scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                             permitted.

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should
considerations that the Government and take the following factors into consideration when advising on and
the Climate Commission will need to          setting budgets:
take into account when advising on and       • scientific knowledge regarding climate change

setting budgets?                             • technology relevant to climate change
                                             • economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the
                                             economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the
                                             economy
                                             • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on

                                             taxation, public spending and public borrowing
                                             • social circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel

                                             • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy
                                             supplies and

                                             the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.
Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require

Governments to set out plans within a        Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change
certain timeframe to achieve the             Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan.
emissions budgets?
Q10. What are the most important             The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
issues for the Government to consider        comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and

in setting plans to meet budgets? For        reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi. The content of the plans
example, who do we need to work with,        must be comprehensive: energy sector, food , population and
what else needs to be considered?            immigration, buildings and cities, land-use opportunities, transport,
                                             materials and recycling, and future options under research e.g.
                                             autonomous electric cars. Science and engineering expertise in the

                                             public service will need to be greatly improved.
Q11. The Government has proposed that
                                             Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.
the Climate Change Commission advises        However, the Government should be legally required to consider and
on and monitors New Zealand's                formally respond to the Commission’s advice, and to provide an
progress towards its goals. Do you
agree with these functions?                  explanation if they do not act on it.

Q12. What role do you think the Climate
Change Commission should have in             The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in
                                             the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to the
relation to the New Zealand Emissions        number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?

Q13. The Government has proposed that collective expertise-amended
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)

proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests
                                             • science expertise (including mātauranga Māori)- This should make
                                             up the majority of the commissioners
                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,
                                             insurance and local

                                             government
                                             • risk management
                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                             • community engagement and communications.
                                             • business competitiveness

                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology
                                             development system.

                                             I think expertise in public health and disability is also necessary

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill
should cover adapting to climate             Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within
change?                                      the Climate Commission.

Q15. The Government has proposed a           I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance

number of new functions to help us           is required in terms of how local councils are involved:
adapt to climate change. Do you agree        • a national climate change risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan
                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                             adaptation plan

                                             • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation
reporting power that could see some          Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Further comments                             It is essential that leadership is shown to educate the public about
                                             how important it is that New Zealand reaches its target of being

                                             carbon neutral by 2050. Resources need to be prioritised so that we
                                             can achieve this goal. We cannot continue with what we are
                                             currently doing.
