A Zero Carbon Act is important to me            We are already seeing the impacts of climate change in increasing
because...                                      droughts, flooding and storms, and all predictions are that it will
                                                continue to worsen. We need rapid, and significant action from all

                                                levels of society in order to begin carbon drawdown, and to mitigate
                                                for against what promises to be rolling climate crisis.

                                                Impending climate change has been an ongoing, distressing part of
                                                my adolesence into adulthood, making me unable to clearly plan for

                                                the future, or imagine how life on the planet will be as I grow older. I
                                                fear for the vulnerability of our food system to extremes of weather,
                                                and hunger and social unrest that will come with that. I grieve for the
                                                collapse of already damaged ecosystems as changing climate
                                                pushes them out of natural cycles. The loss of coral reefs is

                                                devestating - and what will we do if/when the great ocean currents
                                                that regulate the planets' temperature cease to function as they
                                                have for millenia?

                                                A rapid transtion to not just zero, but *negative* carbon is essential

                                                from a responsible, governement that has the interests of current
                                                and future generations at heart. This is not about economics, it is
                                                about our potential to live well and any economics of this decison, or
                                                favouring of corporate profits, should be viewed through a lense of
                                                social and ecological wellbeing.

Q1. What process should the
Government use to set a new emissions           The Government should set a target for 2030 in legislation now, with

                                                negative by 2050. Whether or not we currently deem this 'realistic'
                                                without the goal being set, we will surely miss any chances.


                                                Alongside taking a science-based approach that ensures our efforts
                                                to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible (ie aiming for
                                                negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases
                                                to sustainable levels). we should be taking a wellbeing based

                                                approach, that goes beyond measuring emissions, to measuring
                                                whether people are thriving in their relationships with each other and
                                                with the land and sea where they live. The crux of the the climate
                                                crisis isn't about playing with numbers of emissions, it is about
                                                ensuring that the conditions for life to flourish continue to the best of

                                                our ability.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its             By using domestic emissions reductions, including new diverse forest

                                                that soil carbon is built in farming and forestry practices, where

                                              certainty. However, the ability to revise the 2050 target in light of
                                              major changes in scientific understanding or international
                                              agreements should be permitted *if* this is to strengthen climate
                                              action. It should be changed to allow more action by government to

                                              support the ongoing wellbeing of the people and ecologies of
                                              Aotearoa.

Q5. The Government proposes that              At a minimum, yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in
three emissions budgets of five years         advance, so that 3 are in effect at all times. Overall though, I hope

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No, but it should be encouraged to exceed their ambitions and bring

to alter emissions budgets?                   about a quicker reduction and drawdown of carbon emissions. The
                                              ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in scientific
                                              understanding or international agreements should be permitted *if*
                                              this is to strengthen climate action.

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed            I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

                                              economy

Q11. The Government has proposed that
the Climate Change Commission advises         Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.
                                              However, the Government should be legally required to consider and

                                              practices.

                                              The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in
                                              the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to the

                                              number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.
Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to          • climate change policy (including emissions trading)

have a range of essential and desirable       • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the              markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                           • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests
                                              • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
                                              • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,

                                              • risk management
                                              • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                              • community engagement and communications.

                                              • business competitiveness
                                              • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology

                                              I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill
should cover adapting to climate              Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within

Further comments                              This has ended up being a more emotive submission than I expected.

                                              Climate change is really a huge threat, and given that most of the
                                              science has been giving conservative predictions for so long for fear
                                              of alarming people - can we please start being alarmed enough to do
                                              something? Please take a risk management approach, and start
                                              acting as if it's going to be catastrophic... The worst that can happen

                                              is that it's not that bad but in the process we build a more equitable,
                                              thriving society and restore the wonderous ecology of life...

                                              And if I haven't gone over it enough already - I really advocate for a

                                              example of how we could do this.

                                              reflected in the final bill.
