A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          Climate change is going to be the major problem that my childrens
because...                                    generation are going to have ro deal with. We owe it to our children
                                              to do the best we possibly can to limit our carbon emissions, and

                                              adapt to a changing climate now, so that they have the best possible
                                              chance of a prosperous future.

Q1. What process should the                   The Government should set a net zero target for 2050 in legislation
Government use to set a new emissions
reduction target in legislation?              now.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The most ambitious target is the best for NZ. Reduce the total
target now, which is the best target for      greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050.
New Zealand?

                                              I also support taking a science-based approach to ensure our efforts
                                              to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible: we should aim for
                                              negative levels of long-lived gases like co2 and nitrous oxide, while
                                              reducing short-lived gases like methane to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           No buying of international carbon credits. Use domestic emissions
targets?                                      reductions only (including from new forest planting).


                                              Remove the current upper limit On the carbon price - a higher and
                                              more predictable carbon price will provide incentive to plant erosion
                                              prone hill country in Native forests.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         No - the 2050 target should not allowed to be altered in response to
the 2050 target to be revised if              “economic changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty.

circumstances change?                         Certainty is needed to determine the true cost of carbon/value of
                                              carbon credits.

                                              However, the ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major
                                              changes in scientific understanding or international agreements

                                              should be permitted.
Q5. The Government proposes that

three emissions budgets of five years         yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be     3 are in effect at all times.
in place at any given time. Do you agree
with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to
to alter emissions budgets?                   “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.

                                              However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                              scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                              permitted.

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed            I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

the Climate Commission will need to           setting budgets:

take into account when advising on and        • scientific knowledge regarding climate change
setting budgets?                              • technology relevant to climate change
                                              • economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the
                                              economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the
                                              economy

                                              • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on
                                              taxation, public spending and public borrowing
                                              • social circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel
                                              poverty
                                              • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy

                                              supplies and the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.

Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider        The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
in setting plans to meet budgets? For        comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and
example, who do we need to work with,        reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that

the Climate Change Commission advises
on and monitors New Zealand's                Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.
progress towards its goals. Do you
agree with these functions?

Q12. What role do you think the Climate
Change Commission should have in             The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in
                                             the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to the
relation to the New Zealand Emissions        number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests

                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,
                                             insurance and local
                                             government
                                             • risk management

                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                             • community engagement and communications.
                                             • business competitiveness
                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology
                                             development system.


                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill       Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within
should cover adapting to climate
change?                                      the Climate Commission.

Q15. The Government has proposed a           I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance
number of new functions to help us           is required in terms of how local councils are involved:

adapt to climate change. Do you agree        • a national climate change risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan
                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                             adaptation plan
                                             • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation

reporting power that could see some          Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Further comments                             The Opportunities Party climate change policy was really good. I
                                             hope our new climate law will look similar to their policy.
