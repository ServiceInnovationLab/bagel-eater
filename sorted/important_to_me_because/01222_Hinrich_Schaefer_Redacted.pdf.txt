A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          I work as a scientist measuring greenhouse gases. I see that, despite
because...                                    all political talks worldwide, the levels of carbon dioxide and
                                              methane not only keep rising, but they do so faster than ever. I am

                                              familiar with the research on the expected consequences and we are
                                              already seeing changes to the worse; damage to people, their
                                              property and sources of income and to ecosystems. As a father of
                                              two young boys I know that we have to act fast and with resolve to
                                              avoid harm to them from climate change and to provide them the

                                              best future possible.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             We need to reduce emissions as strongly and as fast as possible. The

New Zealand?                                  for greenhouse gases by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest
targets?                                      planting). This will ensure that NZ is at the forefront of technological
                                              innovations and remains internationally competitive. Partnerships for
                                              emission reductions overseas are desirable but only in direct

                                              partnerships of NZ agencies with local partners so that the impact is
                                              verifiable.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the

                                              understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years         yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed            I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

                                             from international collaboration.

Q11. The Government has proposed that
the Climate Change Commission advises Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body. The

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation

reporting power that could see some          Yes
