A Zero Carbon Act is important to me        It is more than important it is essential, we need to look forward and
because...                                  make an action for the well being of life on earth, we cannot curl up
                                            in a corner and hope it doesn't happen, it will, but we can prevent

                                            that if we take an action NOW.

Q1. What process should the
Government use to set a new emissions       The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050           The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for    zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                            we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing

                                            short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its         By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                    forest planting).

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow       The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if            changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                       ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                            understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years
                                            yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be   3 are in effect at all times.
in place at any given time. Do you agree
with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to
to alter emissions budgets?                 “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.
                                            However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in

                                            scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                            permitted.

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed
considerations that the Government and
the Climate Commission will need to         no
take into account when advising on and

setting budgets?

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require
Governments to set out plans within a       Yes
certain timeframe to achieve the
emissions budgets?

Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider       The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
in setting plans to meet budgets? For       comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and

example, who do we need to work with,       reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that       Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.
the Climate Change Commission advises
on and monitors New Zealand's               However, the Government should be legally required to consider and
progress towards its goals. Do you          formally respond to the Commission’s advice, and to provide an
                                            explanation if they do not act on it.
agree with these functions?

Q12. What role do you think the Climate     The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in
Change Commission should have in            the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to the
relation to the New Zealand Emissions
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?                    number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.
Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)

have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests
                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,

                                             insurance and local
                                             government
                                             • risk management
                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                             • community engagement and communications.

                                             • business competitiveness
                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology
                                             development system.
                                             - it is important that vested interests are kept out of the commission
                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill
should cover adapting to climate             Yes. This may require a separate workstream for adaptation

change?

Q15. The Government has proposed a           I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance
number of new functions to help us           is required in terms of how local councils are involved:
adapt to climate change. Do you agree        • a national climate change risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan
                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national

                                             adaptation plan
                                             • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation
reporting power that could see some          Yes
organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
