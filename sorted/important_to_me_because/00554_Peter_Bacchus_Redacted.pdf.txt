A Zero Carbon Act is important to me           If we do not pull this of the human population will become sicker and
because...                                     sicker before mass extinctions occur. It is vitally important to my
                                               grand children and their grandchildren if humanity lasts as long as

                                               that. When we reach the tipping point we get tipped off!!

Q1. What process should the                    The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now.Yes
Government use to set a new emissions          the gloves need to come off and we need to get serious. Not only do

                                               need to get it back into the soil via vegetation. Beware of large
                                               plantation forests as one lightning can put thousands of tonnes back

                                               into the atmosphere in a few days. They are also large mono cultures
                                               highly susceptible to disease. We need mixed forests interspersed
                                               with farming where the land is most suitable for it.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050              The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for       zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                   ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                               we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing

                                               short-lived gases to sustainable levels. Some of this will be though
                                               changing the way we nourish animals giving them quality fodders
                                               that each animal type was designed to consume.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its            By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                       forest planting).Forest should be of mixed species, mostly slow
                                               maturing native trees that would be selectively logged. Shelter

                                               planting should be actively undertaken with advice from experts as
                                               required. Some farms have shown that thirty percent of the farm can
                                               be planted in trees and shrubs and produce more grass within a
                                               decade and more profit from farming greatly increasing fish life as a
                                               commercial potential

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow          The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic

the 2050 target to be revised if               changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                          ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                               understanding or international agreements should be permitted. It
                                               should be possible to increase the nations economy if the job is done
                                               to the best of our collective capacity.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years
                                               yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that

                                             liters of water.

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:

Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy ( not including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Further comments                              There needs to be a change in the way land is managed. Soil
                                              chemistry needs to be brought up to date as this is a large part of

                                              what has lead to losses of soil carbon. A much better understanding
                                              of soil biology needs to happen and be implemented. A much better
