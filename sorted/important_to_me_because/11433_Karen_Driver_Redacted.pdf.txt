Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:

Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)

                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.
