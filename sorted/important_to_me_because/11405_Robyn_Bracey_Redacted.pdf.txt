because...                                    nations of the world is SOOOOOOOO overdue. I've been reading
                                              about this problem and doing my little bit in various ways politically

                                              to support real action on this issue since the 1970's. Let's now really
                                              make a difference. NZ has led the world in so many progressive
                                              movements.. we need to do the same with this issue.

Q1. What process should the
Government use to set a new emissions         The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now.
reduction target in legislation?              There's real urgency here. Important not to delay

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for      zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to

New Zealand?                                  ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                      forest planting).

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the

circumstances change?                         ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                              understanding or international agreements should be permitted.
                                              Short term economic interests simply shouldn't have the same
                                              priority as the need to tackle climate change. Any talk of 'balancing'
                                              these two as if they're equals is delusional.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years
                                              yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that

with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to

                                              However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in

                                              scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                              permitted. And see my comment to Q4 re the false equivalence of
                                              short term economic interests and action on climate change.

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed            I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

                                              economy. This should be 'taken into account', provided that it

                                              doesn't lead to shying away from the major changes needed.

Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider        The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
in setting plans to meet budgets? For        comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and

Q11. The Government has proposed that Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests

                                             • community engagement and communications.

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill       Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within

with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan
                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national

                                             • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation

reporting power that could see some          Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Further comments                                 In reporting on NZ's progress in meeting these goals over the coming
                                                 years, it's very important that the NZ public is educated about the

                                                 difference between progress in 'intensity' related goals, and progress
                                                 in meeting absolute reductions in GHG's. Intensity 'gains' can be
                                                 really misleading, as so often they're cancelled out by increase in the
                                                 scale of the relevant economic activity. For example, cars which are
                                                 more fuel efficient represent progress from an intensity perspective

                                                 (lower emissions per unit, i.e. per individual car). But, if the total
                                                 number of cars driven in NZ keeps climbing then overall emissions
                                                 from this source will go up in absolute terms despite the fact that the
                                                 cars are individually more efficient (and that the situation would
                                                 have been even worse without the introduction of the better cars).

                                                 It's important that companies etc are not allowed to hide behind talk
                                                 of reducing their emission intensity.. and instead are transparent
                                                 about their progress, or lack of progress, in achieving reduction
                                                 targets overall, in absolute terms.
