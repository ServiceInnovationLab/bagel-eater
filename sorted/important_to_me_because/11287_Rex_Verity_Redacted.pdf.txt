A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          I love my family and friends and the natural world and I want a future
because...                                    worth living, for them and all of our children. We must do our utmost
                                              in New Zealand and encourage and compel as we can everyone and

                                              every decision-maker everywhere to do their utmost to halt and
                                              reverse Climate Change. This crisis is without parallel in human
                                              history.

Q1. What process should the                   The Government should set a series of targets for 2030 (net zero
Government use to set a new emissions         emissions), 2040 (net -5% emissions) and 2050 (net -20% emissions)
reduction target in legislation?              in legislation now.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The most ambitious target; this crisis must be met with urgency and
target now, which is the best target for      extreme measures. I support taking a science-based

New Zealand?                                  PRECAUTIONARY approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions
                                              are as impactful as possible: we should aim for negative levels of
                                              long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable
                                              levels, AS FAST AND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                      forest planting). Efforts to support emissions reduction overseas

                                              should also occur to the maximum extent we can make, and be
                                              selected for the greatest impact, but these efforts must be in
                                              addition to what we do in NZ, not instead of.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                         ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific

                                              understanding or international agreements should be permitted, only
                                              to accelerate reductions.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years         yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be
in place at any given time. Do you agree      3 are in effect at all times.
with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able Emissions budgets should not be altered in response to “economic

to alter emissions budgets?                   changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty. However, the
                                              ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in scientific
                                              understanding or international agreements should be permitted - but
                                              only to accelerate reductions.

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed            I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should
considerations that the Government and take the following factors into consideration when advising on and

the Climate Commission will need to           setting budgets:
take into account when advising on and        • scientific knowledge regarding climate change
setting budgets?                              • technology relevant to climate change
                                              • economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the
                                              economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the

                                              economy - but only to accelerate reductions, not for the sake of
                                              "economic health" per se.
                                              • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on
                                              taxation, public spending and public borrowing - but again only to
                                              accelerate reductions in emissions, not for fiscal considerations per

                                              se.
                                              • social circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel
                                              poverty
                                              • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy
                                              supplies and

                                              the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.
Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require
Governments to set out plans within a        Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change

certain timeframe to achieve the             Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan.
emissions budgets?

Q10. What are the most important             The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
issues for the Government to consider        comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and
in setting plans to meet budgets? For
example, who do we need to work with,        reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi. The needs and opinions
what else needs to be considered?            of children and teenagers must be prioritised.

Q11. The Government has proposed that
                                             Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.
the Climate Change Commission advises        However, the Government should be legally required to consider and
on and monitors New Zealand's                formally respond to the Commission’s advice, and to provide an
progress towards its goals. Do you
agree with these functions?                  explanation if they do not act on it.

Q12. What role do you think the Climate
Change Commission should have in             The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in
                                             the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to the
relation to the New Zealand Emissions        number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading and the TAXING
have a range of essential and desirable      OF CARBON)
expertise. Do you agree with the             • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
proposed expertise?                          markets and distribution)

                                             • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests
                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,
                                             insurance and local
                                             government

                                             • risk management
                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                             • community engagement and communications.
                                             • business competitiveness
                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology

                                             development system.

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill
should cover adapting to climate             Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within
change?                                      the Climate Commission.

Q15. The Government has proposed a           I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance

number of new functions to help us           is required in terms of how local councils are involved:
adapt to climate change. Do you agree        • a national climate change risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan
                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                             adaptation plan

                                             • an adaptation reporting power
Q16. Should the Government explore

setting up a targeted adaptation
reporting power that could see some          Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Further comments                             A significant level of Carbon Tax must be implemented, with or
                                             without the continuation of the ETS.
