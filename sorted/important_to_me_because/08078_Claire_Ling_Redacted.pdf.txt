A Zero Carbon Act is important to me           because climate change is:
because...                                     1) we need a safe and sustainable earth for future generations to
                                               inhabit

                                               2) there is only a finite amount of resources available for now and
                                               the future
                                               3) social justice - homes, dwelling and land is being destroyed
                                               4) worsening weather events effect us all on a daily basis, at least
                                               there is an ongoing financial cost of this and worse lives,livelihoods

                                               and land are being continually lost.
                                               5) thousands upon thousands of people, are and will be displaced.
                                               6) increasing demand on the land available to provide food
                                               7) threat to animal and plant species which will have a negative
                                               impact on things such as the fragile food chain will be impacted upon

                                               creating further sand complex issues.
                                               for life
                                               8) we have only one world to live on and this is a gift from pour
                                               creator who instructed us to steward it and care for it

Q1. What process should the                    The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now.
Government use to set a new emissions          There should also be exploration of different gases etc that effect

reduction target in legislation?               climate change and how best to reduce these.
                                               to think about short term goals along the way

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050              The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for       zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                   ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                               we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                               short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its            By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new

targets?                                       forest planting). consideration of all businesses and agriculture but
                                               personnally I do not think NZ should use international climate credits

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow          The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if               changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                          ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                               understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years
                                               yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be      3 are in effect at all times.
in place at any given time. Do you agree
with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to
to alter emissions budgets?                    “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.
                                               However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in

                                               scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                               permitted.
                                               unless we see that there is urgent need to revise our targets as a
                                               result of severe need and worsening conditions within our world
Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should
considerations that the Government and take the following factors into consideration when advising on and

the Climate Commission will need to          setting budgets:
take into account when advising on and       • scientific knowledge regarding climate change

                                             • economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the
                                             economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the

                                             economy
                                             • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on
                                             taxation, public spending and public borrowing
                                             • social circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel
                                             poverty

                                             • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy
                                             supplies and
                                             the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require      Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change
Governments to set out plans within a        Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan.
certain timeframe to achieve the             all of this must be transparent and obvious to everybody, with
emissions budgets?                           encouragement on how individuals will be effected and how they can

                                             get involved.
                                             it also gives an element of accountabity

Q10. What are the most important             The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
issues for the Government to consider
in setting plans to meet budgets? For        comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and
example, who do we need to work with,        reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
                                             it is vital that the emissions budget is relevant for our context
what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that
the Climate Change Commission advises Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.
on and monitors New Zealand's                it should have authority to give recommendations and to call the
progress towards its goals. Do you           government to account regarding progress
agree with these functions?

Q12. What role do you think the Climate
Change Commission should have in             The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in
                                             the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to the
relation to the New Zealand Emissions        number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)

proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests
                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,
                                             insurance and local
                                             government

                                             • risk management
                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                             • community engagement and communications.
                                             • business competitiveness
                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology

                                             development system.

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill       Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within
should cover adapting to climate             the Climate Commission.
change?                                      i think it should cover short term adaptation as well as long term. I
                                             think individuals all need to learn and have advice on how to adapt

                                             to what aiming for a zero net emissions will mean to us all and how
                                             we can contribute. any change will effect all of us. we will all need to
                                             adapt along the way as the world changes
Q15. The Government has proposed a             I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance
number of new functions to help us             is required in terms of how local councils are involved:

adapt to climate change. Do you agree          • a national climate change risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                   • a national adaptation plan
                                               • regular review of progress is a vital aspect towards implementing
                                               the national adaptation plan
                                               • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation

reporting power that could see some            Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Further comments                               we have a moral, social, spiritual and ethical obligation to take this
                                               seriously. I would like to give a good world to our next generation
                                               that enjoy many of the things that I do today.

                                               i think we have a responsibility to look after our neighbours, which
                                               means those that are poor, marginalised and vulnerable who live on
                                               the margins of land that will be the first to be effected. Our actions
                                               effect their lives. Displacement of thousands will in turn effect the
                                               rest of us because they will need to live, and I would suggest live

                                               well as possible. population increase has a huge effect on how we
                                               feed each other and house ever climate change increasingly places
                                               large demands on this too.



                                               how do incorporate incentivising the government as a whole and
                                               individual companies or industries to reach the targets set?

                                               think very carefully about our housing stock and how to new builds
                                               and existing houses with least impact and low carbon effect.


                                               This act to be supported actively by all political parties so it will be
                                               ongoing even when political parties in power change.

                                               Future visioning to include all of us to ask what would we like our

                                               world, nation, our communities, our neighbourhoods to look like in
                                               2050
