A Zero Carbon Act is important to me         I am extremely concerned about the effects of climate change on
because...                                   people, other living species and the biosphere. The increasing
                                             amount of carbon in the atmosphere is already having a catastrophic

                                             effect on our planet. This is evidenced in New Zealand with the more
                                             extreme weather events we are experiencing and their associated
                                             coastal inundations. We need to act together now as a nation to
                                             reduce the amount of greenhouse gases we are producing and keep
                                             carbon in the ground to mitigate the effects of climate change. We

                                             need to step up and make a difference now for future generations
                                             and other living organisms on our Earth.

Q1. What process should the                  The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now.
Government use to set a new emissions        There needs to be a legally binding agreement reached by all
reduction target in legislation?             political parties for this target that cannot be repealed in the future.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050            I want the most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to
target now, which is the best target for     net zero by 2050. I also strongly support taking a scientific evidence-
New Zealand?                                 based approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions have as

                                             much impact as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-
                                             lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels.


Q3. How should New Zealand meet its          By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                     forest planting) and not by trading international carbon credits.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow        The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if             changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the

circumstances change?                        ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                             understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years        Yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be
in place at any given time. Do you agree     3 are in effect at all times. This should be a cornerstone of this Act.

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to

to alter emissions budgets?                  “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.
                                             However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                             scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                             permitted.

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

Q10. What are the most important

example, who do we need to work with,        reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that        Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.
the Climate Change Commission advises
on and monitors New Zealand's                However, the Government should be legally required to consider and
progress towards its goals. Do you           formally respond to the Commission’s advice, and to provide an
                                             explanation if they do not act on it.
agree with these functions?

Q12. What role do you think the Climate      The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in

relation to the New Zealand Emissions

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree that the following collective expertise needed by Climate

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

exposure to climate change risks?

Further comments                             The time to act is now. We need strong, legally binding targets and
                                             the political clout to ensure that they are achieved. This Act needs to
                                             be written so it fulfils these purposes.
