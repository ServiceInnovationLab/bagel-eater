A Zero Carbon Act is important to me
because...                                  We have no time to lose!

Q1. What process should the
Government use to set a new emissions       The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now.

reduction target in legislation?
Q2. If the Government sets a 2050           The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net

target now, which is the best target for    zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                            we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                            short-lived gases to sustainable levels. WE NEED TO CONTROL
                                            METHANE LEVELS NOW - THERE ARE SOLUTIONS IF GOVT LOOKS

                                            BEYOND THE SCIENCE THAT HAS BEEN FUNDED FOR 9 YEARS BY THE
                                            PREVIOUS GOVT.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its         By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                    forest planting).

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow       NO. The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if            changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. THE WORLD
circumstances change?                       HAS WASTED DECADES WAITING FOR THE SCIENCE TO CHANGE

                                            WHAT HAS BEEN CLEAR. IT CANNOT AFFORD TO WAIT ANY LONGER
                                            AND GOVERNMENTS MUST SHOW STRENGTH IN CONVICTION.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years       yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be
in place at any given time. Do you agree    3 are in effect at all times.
with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to

                                            However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                            scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                            permitted - INCREASED BUDGETS ONLY.

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed          I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

what else needs to be considered?            Carbon sequestration is of prime importance. eg. Making

                                             charcoal/biochar from biomass that would otherwise be wasted, and
                                             returning it to the soil; Changing agricultural practices to achieve
                                             carbon sequestrations by changing to perenial pasture grasses;

                                             Managed grazing, so that perenail grass roots draw down carbon in

                                             their roots when excess root mass is shed by the plants.

                                             carbon can be sequestered. See the book "Drawdown" Edited by Paul
                                             Hawken for more ways.

Q11. The Government has proposed that
                                             Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.
the Climate Change Commission advises        However, the Government should be legally required to consider and
on and monitors New Zealand's                formally respond to the Commission’s advice, and to provide an
progress towards its goals. Do you
agree with these functions?                  explanation if they do not act on it.

Q12. What role do you think the Climate
Change Commission should have in             The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in
                                             the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to the
relation to the New Zealand Emissions        number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests

                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,
                                             insurance and local
                                             government
                                             • risk management

                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                             • community engagement and communications.
                                             • business competitiveness
                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology
                                             development system.


                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill       Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within
should cover adapting to climate
change?                                      the Climate Commission.

Q15. The Government has proposed a           I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance
number of new functions to help us           is required in terms of how local councils are involved:

adapt to climate change. Do you agree        • a national climate change risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan
                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                             adaptation plan
                                             • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation

reporting power that could see some          Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
