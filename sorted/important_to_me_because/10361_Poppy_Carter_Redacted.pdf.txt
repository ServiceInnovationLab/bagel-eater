A Zero Carbon Act is important to me            I really believe a Zero Carbon Act is exactly what New Zealand (and
because...                                      frankly many other countries) require in order to systematically
                                                approach the issue of climate change with real urgency. It is obvious

                                                from the science that we as humans can not continue living the
                                                same as we have in the past. Passing a Zero Carbon Act would mean
                                                we are able to address the issues faced not only within our country,
                                                but within other nations who are being greatly effected by this issue.
                                                These countries, more likely than not, do not have the economic

                                                capability to combat these problems, and have barely even
                                                contributed to them in the first place. We need this law not only
                                                because New Zealand has such an amazing opportunity to make a
                                                difference to the preservation of our beautiful planet, but because
                                                we can be an example to the rest of the world.


                                                Personally, this issue is about a love for the planet and a love for my
                                                people. Being a wahine Māori and my father coming from Kiribati, my
                                                passion for loving the environment is very personal, so I therefore
                                                take it very seriously. I am lucky in that my marae is not on the

                                                coast, however others are not so lucky; their whenua and thereby
                                                their history, is going to be taken away from them. This is the same
                                                in Kirbati. My family moved to Samoa when the results of climate
                                                change in the islands started becoming prevalent. It is extremely
                                                saddening to have to leave your home, where your people have lived

                                                for so long.

                                                It is important to not forget in the midst of the climate statistics and
                                                the dollar signs, that this issue is about people. It is about protecting
                                                people, and it is about helping people understand and be grateful for

                                                the land that we live on. The ideology within tikanga Māori, I believe,
                                                is a prime example of how governments should not only be looking
                                                to new technologies, but also to the ideas of indigenous peoples. As
                                                we must ensure that no one is left behind on this journey to a
                                                greener economy. Including all communities in New Zealand is one

                                                of the best things the New Zealand Government could do.
Q1. What process should the                     The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now.

Government use to set a new emissions           Being able to lock in this ambitious target right now means that
reduction target in legislation?                there is guaranteed political accountability, and therefore the
                                                policies will be as effective as possible.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050               The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for        zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                    ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:

                                                we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                                short-lived gases to sustainable levels. Reducing all emissions to net
                                                zero by 2050 is the only option if we truly want to make a difference
                                                to the state of the planet.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its             By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                        forest planting). The intention of this Act is to create a good level of

                                                certainty. If we are to include emission reductions from overseas, it
                                                would create uncertainty about what reductions need to be
                                                achieved.
Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow          The 2050 target should never be allowed to be revised as a result of
the 2050 target to be revised if               "economic changes". This is because it diminishes the initial

circumstances change?                          intentions of the Act, which is to provide certainty to the country. The
                                               target should only be revised and changed is there are new scientific
                                               developments that would effect the type of policies that will be
                                               required. It should also be revised so to

with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able If there is the ability to alter emissions budgets, there is the risk that
to alter emissions budgets?                    under certain governments, the budgets could be set far too low -
                                               without consideration for the environment - in order to suit the
                                               agenda of whoever is in government at that time.


                                               Budgets may only be reviewed in exceptional circumstances or in

                                               agreements should be permitted. What new governments should be
                                               doing is creating policies that address the issue with regard to the

                                               current situation of the climate, in order to meet the set targets.

emissions budgets?                             Government should take advantage of this. We must set clear
                                               timeframes within which the Government must make policy plans to
                                               meet the emissions budgets.

Q10. What are the most important               The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be

example, who do we need to work with,
what else needs to be considered?              The Government must work with all people of Aotearoa to ensure
                                               this journey is fair, and does not leave anyone behind. They must

                                               consider the rights of the tangata whenua under the founding
                                               document of our country, Te Tiriti o Waitangi. Policies that are
                                               created must reflect this consideration and should include a
                                               significant element of tikanga Māori. When all groups are respected
                                               and included in this process, it will not only be beneficial to our

                                               planet, but to the solidarity of our communities.
Q11. The Government has proposed that The proposed Commission should be limited to holding advisory roles
the Climate Change Commission advises only. This is because the Commission are appointed, rather than

on and monitors New Zealand's                elected, so it would therefore be unconstitutional to allow members
progress towards its goals. Do you           who are not democratically elected by the public, to make decisions
agree with these functions?                  on the behalf of the public.

                                             The Climate Commission's role should be to provide expert advice,

                                             however they should not have decision-making power as they are
                                             not democratically accountable. Instead, whoever is the current
                                             Government should be held responsible for any decisions made. A
                                             role that is exclusively advisory would also strengthen the
                                             Commission's ability to monitor the progress of the targets, without

                                             creating a conflict of interest within the group.
Q12. What role do you think the Climate

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour

expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests
                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori

                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                             • community engagement and communications.
                                             • business competitiveness

                                             development system.

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill       Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within

                                             • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation
reporting power that could see some          Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Further comments                             I would be immensely proud of New Zealand to see this Act be

                                             implemented and am extremely excited to see the policies that
                                             come from the Zero Carbon Act.
