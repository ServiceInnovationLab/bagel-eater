A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          Humans and many other species on the planet are at very real risk of
because...                                    extinction, if we cannot respond fast enough and trigger too many
                                              positive feedback mechanisms. A 4-degree rise in temperature by

                                              the end of this century would probably trigger a much larger rise in
                                              temperature by the end of the following century, and the momentum
                                              would be beyond humans' combined ability to stop.

Q1. What process should the
Government use to set a new emissions         The Government should set an ambitious target for 2050 in
reduction target in legislation?              legislation now.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for      zero by 2050, AND reducing mining and importation of fossil oil, gas

New Zealand?                                  and coal to zero by 2050.

                                              Distinguishing between long-term forms of carbon storage (fossil
                                              fuels) and carbon in the short-term carbon cycle (biomass,
                                              atmospheric carbon, etc) is very important, since any long-storage

                                              carbon that we transfer into the short-term cycle (by mining fossil
                                              fuels), makes atmospheric carbon targets harder to meet:
                                              effectively, every tonne of coal we burn requires more land to be
                                              converted to protected, long-term forestry to offset it. ("Long-term"
                                              means millions of years.)


                                              I also support taking a science-based approach to ensure our efforts
                                              to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible: we should aim for
                                              negative net levels of long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived
                                              gases to sustainable levels.


                                              Targets should be clearly stated, not misleading like NZ's previous
                                              target which specified gross emissions at start of period but net
                                              emissions at end of period.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                      forest planting). I do not support international carbon trading as this

                                              has proven ineffective and allowed dangerous delays.

                                              I support imposing a carbon tax on fossil fuels at point of production
                                              or import, to be paid back to New Zealanders via a citizens dividend.
                                              This tax can be ratcheted up over time.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the

with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able Budgets should be allowed to be tightened but not relaxed in
to alter emissions budgets?                   response to “economic changes” as this would undermine their long-
                                              term certainty. However, the ability to revise budgets in light of
                                              major changes in scientific understanding or international
                                              agreements should be permitted.
Q8. Do you agree with the proposed

setting budgets?

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require     Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change

certain timeframe to achieve the            Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan: plans should

Q10. What are the most important            It is vital to distinguish between fossil fuels (long-storage carbon) and

issues for the Government to consider       carbon in the short-term cycle. Fossil fuel use must urgently be

example, who do we need to work with,       rather than a short-term impact (centuries), and effectively requires

                                            it.


                                            The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
                                            comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and
                                            reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
