A Zero Carbon Act is important to me         I want us to act on climate change now. I don't want to leave it to my

                                             would be unloving and selfish. We need a law because we need a

                                             keep on pussy-footing around the issue as we have for the last 30
                                             years.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050            The government needs to be ambitious and brave. It should aim to

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its          By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                     forest planting).

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow        The government needs to be careful with this, in case future
