A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          I have personally seen the devastation on coral reefs around the
because...                                    world, major forest ecosystems that have been changed eg Amazon.
                                              And am very aware of the impact climate change is already having

                                              on poor communities in under developed countries around the world.
                                              this is already leading to greater conflict, eg east africa, massive
                                              floods and devastated communities - SE/N asia, S and central
                                              america. So far NZ has escaped the worst, however, as a developed
                                              country producing very high CO2 emissions from transport we have a

                                              duty to do our bit we cant sit back and say we are too small. We
                                              have No Planet B, and need to take action now before its too late for
                                              the other animals and plants that are part of our planet, humans
                                              have done enough damage.

Q1. What process should the
Government use to set a new emissions         The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now.

reduction target in legislation?
Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net

target now, which is the best target for      zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                  ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                      forest planting).

                                              Get rid of emission trading schemes - they dont work. Instead having
                                              a carbon tax - so you are creating incentives at all levels to reduce
                                              carbon emissions, this tax should then be used to support low
                                              income households - insulation, more energy efficient heating,as well
                                              as public transport, active transport, eg incentivising purchase of

                                              bikes (Cyclescheme UK), solar panels (this has been very successful
                                              in UK with large uptake of solar on houses), public education
                                              campaigns, supporting more enviro friendly farming practises,
                                              planting of trees etc. Need carrot and a stick. However, I recognise
                                              there are issues with imported goods and disadvantages to NZ

                                              products exporting to countries with no carbon tax.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                         ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                              understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be     yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
                                              3 are in effect at all times.

with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able Need Carbon tax. No - emissions budgets / carbon taxes should not

                                              their long-term certainty. However, the ability to revise budgets in
                                              light of major changes in scientific understanding or international

                                              agreements should be permitted.
Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

the Climate Commission will need to          setting budgets:

                                             economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the

                                             • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on

                                             poverty - this could be offset with carbon tax used to help low

                                             income households.
                                             • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy

Governments to set out plans within a        Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change

Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider        The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be

what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that

agree with these functions?

Q12. What role do you think the Climate
Change Commission should have in             The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in
relation to the New Zealand Emissions        the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to the

Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests

                                             • climate and environmental science
                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,
                                             insurance and local
                                             government
                                             • risk management

                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                             • community engagement and communications.
                                             • business competitiveness
                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

with the proposed functions?                  • a national adaptation plan

                                              • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore

Further comments                              Needs to be incentives and regulations for local government.
                                              Currently things like waste management, resource management eg,
                                              infill housing vr urban sprawl, prioritising active and PT over private

                                              transport are at the discretion of local authorities, eg 10 year plan for
                                              WCC has NOTHING about reducing carbon emissions, or targets for
                                              recycling. So unless local govt are 'compelled' to implement Carbon
                                              zero we have no chance of reaching carbon zero by 2050, especially
                                              given the high car ownership in NZ (4th highest in world) -

                                              incentivizing E vehicles doesnt actually help much. As E cars require
                                              huge resources to produce and we'll need heaps more power
                                              generated - more dams, wind farms, maybe getting everyone to
                                              have solar panels on their roofs could help!, EV wont solve
                                              congestion and certainly are a poor use of non renewable resources.
