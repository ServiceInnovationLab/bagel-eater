A Zero Carbon Act is important to me         At no point in recent human history have we faced such a serious
because...                                   global threat to our prosperity and security. As a relatively wealthy
                                             nation, NZ needs to lead by example. If we don't act decisively, our

                                             kids will have good reason to despise us for leaving them in
                                             economic chaos.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its          By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new

                                             irresponsible and lazy.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow        The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic

                                             However, the ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major

                                             However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
