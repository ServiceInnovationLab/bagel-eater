A Zero Carbon Act is important to me           (a) Climate change is a basic existential threat to future generations
because...                                     and is already affecting us now.
                                               (b) NZ has a self-image as a developed and progressive nation. We

                                               have a moral duty to be in the vanguard of constructive change.
                                               (c) Our geography, small population and natural resources give us
                                               the potential to score some early wins in climate change mitigation
                                               to confirm our leadership position.
                                               (d) It will be economically advantageous to be an early adopter and

                                               innovator in the field of climate change mitigation, rather than a
                                               laggard and victim.

Q1. What process should the                    The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now. Sub-

                                               than in a panic in the late 2040s.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050              The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for       zero by 2050. Individual gases may track differently but the average

New Zealand?                                   effect must be the straight-line I refer to in Q1.
                                               I also support taking a science-based approach to ensure our efforts
                                               to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible: we should aim for
                                               negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases
                                               to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its            By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new

targets?                                       forest planting). If, however, a meaningful international market for
                                               carbon credits develops we should take whatever opportunities may
                                               develop to SELL credits – but we must not BUY credits.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow          The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if               changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty, and creates an
circumstances change?                          excuse for sector groups to soften their contribution to the overall

                                               reduction.
                                               However, the ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major
                                               changes in scientific understanding or international agreements
                                               should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that               yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
three emissions budgets of five years          3 are in effect at all times. Graphical reports on progress along the

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to

                                               and reduces the chance for political bipartisanship.
                                               However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in

                                               scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                               permitted.
Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:

Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests

                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,

                                             I think expertise in public health, agriculture, energy and transport is
                                             also important. Consideration must also be given to the 'group
                                             dynamics' and optimal size of such an important commission, and to

Q15. The Government has proposed a              I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance

                                                The potential for local councils to 'fudge' environmental action in
                                                favour of the short-term interests of politically influential local groups

Further comments                                In parallel with the Climate Commission and its processes, the
                                                Government should incorporate zero-carbon measures into its other
                                                activities. For example:
                                                (a) The 100,000 KiwiBuild homes should have solar panels, batteries

                                                and 3-phase wiring for electric car charging built in from new.
                                                (b) Financial and operational involvement by Government-owned
                                                electricity enterprises including Transpower in the provision of home
                                                solar energy and storage should be encouraged.
                                                (c) Government departments and agencies must be instructed to buy

                                                only electric vehicles, if suitable, from now on – and to on-sell them
                                                into the second-hand market in a timely fashion. If this requires extra
                                                Budget allocations then so be it; the downstream encouragement of
                                                electric car adoption will be considerable.
                                                (d) The technology is now sufficiently developed for an early

                                                mandate that only electric vehicles – trains, trams, e-buses, shuttles
                                                etc – may be used in Government-subsidised urban transport (and
                                                eventually all surface transport).
                                                (e) There must be an immediate reversal of KiwiRail's intention to
                                                decommission the existing North Island Main Trunk electrification

                                                and the establishment of a rolling programme of electrification to fill
                                                the gaps in the NIMT and electrify other lines where the traffic
                                                potential justifies. Where electrification cannot be justified (and the
                                                criteria must be climate-adaptation-focussed, not just traditional
                                                economics) other zero-emission traction such as batteries or, maybe,

                                                hydrogen need to be fostered.

                                                renewable energy, the extra power required for fossil fuel
                                                replacement particularly in transport, and the inevitable vagaries of
                                                any one type of renewable electricity generation means that there

                                                will need to be considerable extra investment in generating capacity
                                                and a high level of redundancy. The electricity market is poorly
                                                placed to incentivise that investment – Government action to correct
                                                such market failure will be required.
                                                (g) Forestry waste – 'slash' – and other biomass needs to be captured

                                                as a replacement for coal in dairy factories and emergency power
                                                generation, and as a raw material feedstock for liquid fuels,
                                                biodegradable plastic, etc. A market for this alternative fuel needs to
                                                be developed and railway facilities used for chipping mills and
                                                transport – including revival of under-used and some closed railways.

                                                use is easy.
