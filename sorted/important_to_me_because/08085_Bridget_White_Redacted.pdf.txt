A Zero Carbon Act is important to me         I am twenty years old, and am already beginning to see the effects
because...                                   of climate change around me. Imagine what it would be like for my
                                             children? New Zealand has lagged behind on climate change action

                                             for the last decade, and it's time we caught up.

Q1. What process should the                  The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation. This
Government use to set a new emissions        cannot be an 'advised' target, but must be a legislative target , else
reduction target in legislation?             it would be ignored.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050            I believe that we should aim to have New Zealand be at least carbon
target now, which is the best target for     zero by 2050, including short and long term gasses. We should aim
New Zealand?                                 to be long term carbon negative (through planting trees etc), and
                                             should aim to decrease short term gasses as much as possible.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its          By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new

targets?                                     forest planting). Carbon credits are a sell out, and often we're unsure
                                             if trees are actually planted in Russia (for example).

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow        If major scientific findings or international agreements change, the
the 2050 target to be revised if             2050 target should be able to be revised. However, the target should
circumstances change?                        not change in response to changes in the economy- there will be no
                                             economy if we don't have a planet to inhabit!

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years
                                             Yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be    3 are in effect at all times.
in place at any given time. Do you agree
with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No- unless major scientific findings indicate it needs to be altered, or
to alter emissions budgets?                  if new international agreements are set up. Perhaps the PCE could be
                                             the only person to alter the emissions budget?

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

considerations that the Government and take the following factors into consideration when advising on and
the Climate Commission will need to          setting budgets:
take into account when advising on and       • scientific knowledge regarding climate change
setting budgets?                             • technology relevant to climate change
                                             • economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the

                                             economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the
                                             economy
                                             • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on
                                             taxation, public spending and public borrowing
                                             • social circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel

                                             poverty
                                             • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy
                                             supplies and
                                             the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require      Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change
Governments to set out plans within a        Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan. This needs
certain timeframe to achieve the             to include enforcement- the issues with current targets is that they

emissions budgets?                           are not enforced.

Q10. What are the most important             Policy plans should be clear cut, should reflect equity (for example
issues for the Government to consider        fuel taxes may have a greater effect on one group or people over
in setting plans to meet budgets? For        others), should be well communicated to the general public
example, who do we need to work with,        (including reasoning/ scientific evidence behind policies with
what else needs to be considered?            numbers to back it up), and should reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti

                                             o Waitangi.
Q11. The Government has proposed that
the Climate Change Commission advises The climate change commission should advise on and monitor

on and monitors New Zealand's                progress- it should also have some legislative power and the ability
progress towards its goals. Do you           to impose enforcement when targets are not met.
agree with these functions?

Q12. What role do you think the Climate      The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in
Change Commission should have in
relation to the New Zealand Emissions        the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to the
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?                     number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:

Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests
                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori

                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,
                                             insurance and local
                                             government
                                             • risk management
                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure

                                             • community engagement and communications.
                                             • business competitiveness
                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology
                                             development system.


                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill       Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within
should cover adapting to climate             the Climate Commission. The lives of New Zealanders will have to
change?                                      substantially change in order to adapt to climate change, which is a
                                             frightening prospect (and the reason I believe climate change action
                                             hasn't been taken sooner). Along with legislation, we need support

                                             paths for people to adapt (e.g. further subsidized public transport,
                                             cycling support in schools/universities, alternatives to meat and dairy
                                             based recipes etc). I also believe that farmers are going to be the
                                             people most greatly affected by climate change, and that we need
                                             strong support systems for them as they adapt.

Q15. The Government has proposed a           I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance
number of new functions to help us           is required in terms of how local councils are involved:

adapt to climate change. Do you agree        • a national climate change risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan
                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                             adaptation plan
                                             • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore

setting up a targeted adaptation
reporting power that could see some          Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
