A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          Our planet is too precious to fry!! Global warming is the biggest
because...                                    challenge and threat humanity has ever faced, and it is caused by
                                              our own actions, specifically by our carbon-burning economy and

                                              lifestyle.

Q1. What process should the                   The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now.
Government use to set a new emissions         Actually, I am not convinced that this target is sufficiently ambitious.
reduction target in legislation?              The planetary climate system is displaying such wild reactions and
                                              hyper-sensitivity to the carbon that we have already pumped into its
                                              atmosphere, that I think to be prudent, we should be aiming for zero

                                              carbon by 2040. New Zealand, with its relatively low-population
                                              density and excellent possibilities for renewable energy, should be
                                              better able to achieve this goal than most other nations, and it would
                                              be good for the international effort to have at least one country
                                              modelling this goal.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for      zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to

New Zealand?                                  ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                      forest planting).

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the

                                              understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years         yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be

                                              However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                              scientific understanding or international agreements should be

agree with these functions?

Q12. What role do you think the Climate
Change Commission should have in             The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests

                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,

                                             government
                                             • risk management

                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                             • community engagement and communications.

                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill       Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within
should cover adapting to climate
change?                                      the Climate Commission.

Q15. The Government has proposed a           I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance
number of new functions to help us           is required in terms of how local councils are involved:

with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan
                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                             adaptation plan
                                             • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation

reporting power that could see some          Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Further comments                                 I believe that the ETS would be better replaced by a significant
                                                 carbon tax covering all fossil fuels according to the amount of carbon

                                                 dioxide they can potentially release, and payable at the point where
                                                 they enter the country, (e.g. at the port, mine-head, or wherever).
                                                 This carbon tax should start low, e.g. $40 - $50 per tonne of carbon
                                                 dioxide, and be increased at yearly intervals, with a schedule
                                                 published in advance every 5 years. Such a carbon tax is far more

                                                 transparent than an ETS which is difficult to understand, and prone
                                                 to being negatively influenced by lobbying (as we have already
                                                 seen). Moreover, the revenues collected from imposition of the
                                                 carbon tax, should be returned to the citizens at large, with an equal
                                                 share to all residents and a half-share to all children under the age of

                                                 18. There are two important reasons for this: one is to enable people
                                                 to cope with the increase in the cost of living that would otherwise
                                                 result from the carbon tax (and to enable them to make choices that
                                                 will reduce their carbon footprints). The other reason is that if the
                                                 carbon tax is not returned to the people, then its life may very likely

                                                 soon be cut short by politicians who stand on a platform of "helping
                                                 people" by removing the carbon tax. This same argument has been
                                                 already powerfully made by James Hansen in consultation with
                                                 economists (see "Storms of My Grandchildren"). I believe that the
                                                 ETS is definitely an inferior solution to a carbon tax as above, or a
                                                 "carbon tax with citizens' dividend" as it could be called. A "carbon

                                                 tax with citizens'dividend" would be a simple tax to collect, and a
                                                 progressive measure under which most citizens would be better off.
                                                 What's to dislike about that??
