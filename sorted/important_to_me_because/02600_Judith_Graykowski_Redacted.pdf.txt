A Zero Carbon Act is important to me         A Zero Carbon Act is important to me because the New Zealand government has a moral

                                             implications of NOT reducing CO2 are catastrophic.

Q1. What process should the                  The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now. The Zero Carbon Act

Government use to set a new emissions        framework evolved and tested in practice in the UK is robust and was a cross-party

                                             us: we cannot afford to miss this opportunity.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050            The most ambitious target: total greenhouse gases reduced to net zero by 2050. I also

New Zealand?                                 as impactful as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while
                                             reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its          No more purchase of "hot-air" emissions credits!. Targets should be met by using
targets?                                     domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting).


Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow        The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic changes” as this

                                             permitted.


Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years        yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that 3 are in effect at all
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be
in place at any given time. Do you agree     times.

with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able       No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to “economic changes” as this
to alter emissions budgets?                  undermines their long-term certainty. However, the ability to revise budgets in light of

                                             permitted.

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should take the following
considerations that the Government and factors into consideration when advising on and setting budgets:
the Climate Commission will need to          • scientific knowledge regarding climate change

take into account when advising on and       • technology relevant to climate change
setting budgets?                             • economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the
                                             economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the economy
                                             • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on taxation, public spending

                                             and public borrowing
                                             • social circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel poverty
                                             • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy supplies and

                                             the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require
Governments to set out plans within a        Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change Act and specify a
certain timeframe to achieve the             strict time frame for producing a plan.
emissions budgets?


Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider        The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be comprehensive, fair,
in setting plans to meet budgets? For        cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o

what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that
the Climate Change Commission advises
on and monitors New Zealand's                Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.

agree with these functions?

Q12. What role do you think the Climate
Change Commission should have in             The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS. It
                                             should not make decisions itself with respect to the number of units available in the NZ
relation to the New Zealand Emissions        ETS, or its implementation.
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?
Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)

have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour markets and
expertise. Do you agree with the             distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests
                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori

                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning, insurance and local
                                             government
                                             • risk management

                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                             • community engagement and communications.
                                             • business competitiveness
                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology development system.


                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill
should cover adapting to climate             Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within the Climate

Q15. The Government has proposed a           I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance is required in
number of new functions to help us           terms of how local councils are involved:
adapt to climate change. Do you agree        • a national climate change risk assessment

with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan
                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national adaptation plan
                                             • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation             Yes: the local and international Insurance/ReInsurance companies will already have
                                             assessed their exposure to Climate Change risks, and be vocal and "invested" leaders in
reporting power that could see some          confronting the impacts of Climate Change on their business. Use them as leaders to
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?            share information on their exposure to Climate Change risks.
