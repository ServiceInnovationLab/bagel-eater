A Zero Carbon Act is important to me           I grew up in a family that discussed endlessly The Limits to Growth
because...                                     report, produced in 1972. My PhD was on the biochemical control of
                                               reproduction, because I feared the consequences of population

                                               growth. Back then we didn't know much about the effects of
                                               greenhouse gasses on our planet's climate. But we do now. A Zero
                                               Carbon Act is important to me because it is New Zealand's chance to
                                               lead the world towards a better future. It is important to me because
                                               we must turn away from the neo-liberal ideas of economic growth at

                                               all costs, which have been unsustainable for decades and have led to
                                               the drastic reduction in biodiversity and our crazy dependence on
                                               fossil fuels and their products. A Zero Carbon Act is a first step to
                                               showing that the government realises that the flooding and coastal
                                               erosion we have seen recently, in Golden Bay, Auckland, Canterbury,

                                               Dunedin and now Tolaga Bay, will happen again and again, ruining
                                               lives, livings and assets. The Zero Carbon Act is important because it
                                               will begin to expose the failure of companies, including forestry and
                                               agricultural companies, to pay the full costs of their business.

Q1. What process should the                    The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now. In
Government use to set a new emissions          my opinion this is our last chance to show bold leadership and to

reduction target in legislation?               think globally. I suspect there will be thousands of submissions, on
                                               forms like this, but also hand-written or emailed. When I was a
                                               Commissioner on the Royal Commission on Genetic Modification,
                                               over 10,000 submissions were received, with well over 90% being
                                               against GMO release in New Zealand. The ideas nested in all those
                                               submissions informed our final decisions, but the range of views

                                               made the process unwieldy. I like the consultative, collaborative
                                               approach taken by this government. Yes, people will respond from
                                               both "sides" of the argument, but the consultation document clearly
                                               lays out three options to choose from. This is very useful, both to the
                                               submitter and to the decision makers! As James Shaw says "With this

                                               challenge comes opportunity". In this case I believe the opportunities
                                               are numerous and not facing up to the challenge calamitous.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050              To quote Horace, who would probably have been philosophical about
target now, which is the best target for       climate change, "Begin, be bold, and venture to be wise.” Choose net
New Zealand?                                   zero emissions by 2050. Do not listen to the lobbyists! Yes, this will
                                               have the biggest impact on our agricultural sector, but it is clear to

                                               me that we need to include all activities in our emissions reductions.
                                               Of course we must take a science-based approach to reducing
                                               emissions, so we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels.
Q3. How should New Zealand meet its             I am a strong supporter of New Zealand concentrating on its own
targets?                                        emissions and I do not believe we can trade our way out of trouble. I

                                                love the "billion trees" idea, but the bulk of those trees should not be
                                                harvested every 20 years. Parts of the country that are steep and
                                                eroding fast (and our irreversible loss of soil into the ocean is another
                                                major issue which we are not addressing), such as the East Coast of
                                                the North Island, should be reforested in native flora, including

                                                manuka and kanuka in perpetuity. These lands will take many years
                                                to recover, but could/should be used for non-extractive uses,
                                                including honey production, recreation (biking, tramping and rafting,
                                                etc.), with farms confined to the valley floors. The amount of "slash"
                                                coming down the rivers after the big rain events we are frequently

                                                experiencing suggests the forestry industry needs to look carefully at
                                                its logging processes. I can understand the idea of leaving the slash
                                                to compost and provide nutrients to the next crop, but the change of
                                                weather conditions may require a change to this, such as the
                                                production of mulch. Yes, all this will require money and change the

                                                economics of logging pinus radiata, but the cost of cleaning up and
                                                righting people's lives will be huge too, in places like Tolaga Bay.

                                                The other major change that is required is to increase the EV fleet, in
                                                government agencies, as well as commercially, at a much faster rate
                                                than currently. Part of that move requires the import of a wider

                                                range of second-hand EVs and PHEVs to help make the transition
                                                more affordable. And, as a PHEV driver, the network of fast charge
                                                stations needs to expand hugely too. Encouragement of new
                                                innovations, such as stand alone (and possibly solar-powered)
                                                charging stations in regional towns, would help convert people. On a

                                                recent trip in my PHEV, groups of people inevitably gathered to ask
                                                questions, as soon as I plugged my car in. People are hungry for
                                                change and for solutions.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow           The 2050 target should NOT be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if                changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. I feel this is our

                                                change. However, the ability to revise the 2050 target in light of
                                                major changes in scientific understanding or international
                                                agreements should be permitted. For example, there may be such a
                                                response that the world's emissions start plummeting. Yeah right.

Q5. The Government proposes that

                                                Yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that

with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to

                                                However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                                scientific understanding or international agreements should be

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

                                             economy should be understood, but I believe we need new
                                             approaches to our economy to deal with climate change.

                                             I think expertise in public health and science communication are also
                                             important.

Further comments                             I think I've said enough. I am very pessimistic that anything can be
                                             done to have any real impact on climate change, even if New
                                             Zealand reduces its emissions to zero.
