A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          As a young teenager soon to reach adulthood, the concept of climate
because...                                    change is more than slightly terrifying. Hanging in the balance is my
                                              future, the future of my friends and family, the future of New

                                              Zealand (and indeed the whole world) and frankly I don't believe that
                                              the government over the past decade has done enough or taken the
                                              issue as seriously as it needed to. I am more than relieved that the
                                              new government has finally taken action on creating a long-term
                                              plan to combat out greenhouse gas emissions and address the

                                              effects of climate change that are already showing. It's such an
                                              important issue in terms of the future of our species and the planet
                                              as a whole, so the creation of an effective and genuine Zero Carbon
                                              Act means so much to me.

                                              are as impactful as possible: we should aim for negative levels of
                                              long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable
                                              levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new

targets?                                      forest planting).

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic

Q5. The Government proposes that

                                              major changes in scientific understanding or international

                                              agreements should be permitted.

                                              It is important that vested interests are not part of the commission.
