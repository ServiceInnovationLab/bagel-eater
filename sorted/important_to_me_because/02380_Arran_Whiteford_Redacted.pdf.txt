A Zero Carbon Act is important to me           I am a glaciologist that sees first hand the effects of climate change.
because...                                     Though these effects are sad, and effect me personally, they are
                                               minuscule relative to the longer term climate change.


                                               Every issue on our planet will be amplified by climate change -
                                               development, conflict, environmental degradation.
                                               I am terrified for the effects of rising sea levels on low lying coutries
                                               like bangladesh or indonesia, the increasing fickle weather and

                                               droughts that will hit Africa and South America, and worldwide loss of
                                               biodiversity and habitat. Even if we are selfish, global crises of
                                               poverty, and mass migration will impact NZ severely. And in our
                                               home, new tropical invasive species will wreck havoc, storms will
                                               smash us, and an unstable global community will rock our island

                                               security.

                                               The only way to mitigate climate change is to stop greenhouse gas
                                               emissions now. The only way this is possible is through strong
                                               government intervention. The pollution market is not free or fair

                                               without regulations taxes or costs.

Q1. What process should the                    The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now.
Government use to set a new emissions
reduction target in legislation?               Don't consult with the public. Don't consult industry, we've had
                                               enough time to do that. We need action.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050              The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for       zero by 2050.
New Zealand?

                                               I also support taking a science-based approach to ensure our efforts
                                               to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible: we should aim for
                                               negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases
                                               to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its            By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                       forest planting).


                                               I would favour an emissions trading scheme.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow          The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if               changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                          ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                               understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that

                                               yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that

with this proposal?

                                               scientific understanding or international agreements should be
