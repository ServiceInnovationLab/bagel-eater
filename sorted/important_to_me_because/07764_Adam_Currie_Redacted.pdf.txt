A Zero Carbon Act is important to me           I support the passing of legally binding climate law.
because...
                                               The law must be fair, ambitious and consistent with the climate

                                               science and international frameworks by including all gases and all
                                               sectors.

                                               The legislation should establish the goal of limiting warming to 1.5
                                               degrees. We should not settle for 2 degrees warming, that would

                                               lock in devastating impacts on Pacific Island states and cause
                                               significant extinctions. That is not acceptable.

                                               To give us the best possibility of achieving no more than 1.5 degrees
                                               warming by the end of the century, there must be rapid cuts in all

                                               greenhouse gases beginning now. I support a net-zero target of 2040
                                               with the majority of cuts occurring over the next decade.

                                               I support all greenhouse gases being included in the law, consistent
                                               with international climate frameworks. The Intergovernmental Panel

                                               on Climate Change makes it clear that methane reduction is critical
                                               to success in tackling climate change. It is politically and
                                               scientifically untenable for New Zealand’s climate law to exclude any
                                               gases from our biggest emitting sector - the agricultural sector.


                                               I support the establishment of a Climate Commission, whose role
                                               should be to devise binding budgets. The Climate Commission should
                                               have statutory teeth, otherwise it is merely an advisory group that
                                               governments could ignore. Climate budgets should be legally binding
                                               and set a bare-minimum ambition, which must be achieved or

                                               bettered by government within the prescribed timeframes. While
                                               budgets should be binding, policy recommendations from the
                                               Commission should be just that - recommendations.

                                               I support the ‘firewall’ principle, that New Zealand’s targets must be

                                               achieved by actual cuts in our own emissions, and not through the
                                               purchase of overseas carbon credits or an over-reliance on forests as
                                               carbon sinks

                                               While consensus across political parties is good, any cross-party

                                               agreement should not be achieved at the cost of strong climate law.
                                               Climate change is the greatest challenge facing humanity. It would
                                               be wrong to have broad agreement on weak law, when what is
                                               urgently needed to address the problem is strong law.

                                               The world needs pathways to transformational change if we are to

                                               avoid catastrophic warming. This is the scale of the challenge. The
                                               science is clear: the only way we can succeed is with big ambition.
                                               New Zealand must be bold and pass strong law for the sake of our
                                               precious earth and future generations.

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

                                                 significance – disguises the fact that what matters is not the date we

                                                 finally stop emitting, but the track we take to get there. Rapid
                                                 reductions now, taking advantage of all the easy options right away,
                                                 then slowing down the rate when things get harder, will warm the
                                                 climate less by 2050 than waiting till the last minute, then taking
                                                 extreme action. What matters is moving fast to cut back methane

                                                 emissions to a much lower level, then holding them at that level. The
                                                 longer we delay methane cuts, the further we will have to cut. While
                                                 changes in animal diets can help reduce methane release, we cannot
                                                 avoid addressing animal numbers which are unsustainable on many
                                                 levels, including land use, water quality and milk processing

                                                 emissions. Reducing the number of cows will reduce emissions of
                                                 both nitrous oxide and methane, and raising the remaining animals
                                                 less intensively, feeding them better on grass and reducing input
                                                 costs of fertiliser, feed and pharmaceuticals can increase profitability
                                                 for farmers.


                                                 Methane emissions also come from natural gas leaks from the fuel
                                                 system. Fracking in Taranaki and gas leaks from oil drilling both
                                                 contribute to this. They add significantly to the warming from the
                                                 CO2 produced by burning the gas. I would put them in a different
                                                 basket from biological methane: they should go to zero along with all

                                                 fossil fuels. Old gas wells may need to be managed for some time to
                                                 prevent such leaks adding to methane in the atmosphere. We simply
                                                 cannot ignore emmisions from agriculture.

                                                 The Climate Commission must take into account Pacifika and Tikanga

                                                 Maori views. It must be fair, and it should aim to be Carbon Zero by
                                                 2040, as 2050 is simply too late. I implore you, to take Climate
                                                 change seriously.
