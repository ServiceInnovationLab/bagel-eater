A Zero Carbon Act is important to me           We have only this planet.
because...                                     Scientific consensus is that climate change is a serious threat to life
                                               on the planet.

                                               Too many species have already gone extinct, more are declining and
                                               likely to become extinct.
                                               Severe weather events have become common as predicted.
                                               We need a carbon tax now. Not an emissions trading scheme, not
                                               voluntary compliance.

Q1. What process should the                    The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now. This

Government use to set a new emissions          target needs to be supported by a carbon tax which fully internalizes
reduction target in legislation?               the costs of the activity.

                                               Emissions trading schemes have already been cheated by those
                                               seeking profits. Note the fraudulent 'cheap' eastern European

                                               credits.

                                               Government should apply current scientific consensus as to what is
                                               required to reverse climate change. As more is known and as the
                                               results of our actions become clear the target will likely require

                                               revision.

                                               A carbon tax can be fairly and comprehensively applied. It can be
                                               adjusted to apply new knowledge. Some of the revenue generated
                                               can be returned to consumers to encourage better consumer
                                               choices.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050              The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net

target now, which is the best target for       zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                   ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                               we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                               short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its            Include all sources of green house gasses in reducing our emissions.
targets?                                       Apply carbon taxes to imports where those imported items have not

                                               been assessed tax at a level equal to or greater than the tax
                                               required from NZ producers. (If this runs afoul of 'trade' agreements
                                               NZ must cease signing such badly negotiated deals and seek to exit
                                               from those already signed.)
                                               Use domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest

                                               planting).
Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow          The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic

the 2050 target to be revised if               changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the

                                               understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be      yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that

with this proposal?
Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to

                                               However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                               scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                               permitted.
                                               All budgets must be open to increases only. Future governments
                                               beholden to special interest groups must not be permitted to

                                               decrease funding or the commitment required to reduce and
                                               eliminate our emissions.
                                               In the unlikely event of 'excess' funding that funding can be applied
                                               to NZ developing alternative energy technology and/or supporting
                                               less well off countries in their efforts to reduce emissions.

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation

organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?

Further comments                              It is clear that the many so called 'trade' agreements place too many
                                              hurdles and exact too much public money be applied to compensate
                                              some of the worst emitters.

                                              These 'agreements' and the ETS are a direct result of the morally

                                              bankrupt neo liberal ideology which has brought life on the planet to
                                              the brink, and beyond.

                                              If NZ is sincere in wishing to accomplish the goals implicit in the
                                              proposed act changes far greater than proposed here are required.
