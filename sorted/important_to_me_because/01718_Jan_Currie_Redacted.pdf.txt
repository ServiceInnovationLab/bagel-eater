Further comments                                 Dear Minister,


                                                 I support the passing of legally binding climate law.

                                                 The law must be fair, ambitious and consistent with the climate
                                                 science and international frameworks by including all gases and all
                                                 sectors.


                                                 The legislation should establish the goal of limiting warming to 1.5
                                                 degrees. We should not settle for 2 degrees warming, that would
                                                 lock in devastating impacts on Pacific Island states and cause
                                                 significant extinctions. That is not acceptable.


                                                 To give us the best possibility of achieving no more than 1.5 degrees
                                                 warming by the end of the century, there must be rapid cuts in all
                                                 greenhouse gases beginning now. I support a net-zero target of 2040
                                                 with the majority of cuts occurring over the next decade.


                                                 I support all greenhouse gases being included in the law, consistent
                                                 with international climate frameworks. The Intergovernmental Panel
                                                 on Climate Change makes it clear that methane reduction is critical
                                                 to success in tackling climate change. It is politically and
                                                 scientifically untenable for New Zealand’s climate law to exclude any

                                                 gases from our biggest emitting sector - the agricultural sector.

                                                 I support the establishment of a Climate Commission, whose role
                                                 should be to devise binding budgets. The Climate Commission should
                                                 have statutory teeth, otherwise it is merely an advisory group that

                                                 governments could ignore. Climate budgets should be legally binding
                                                 and set a bare-minimum ambition, which must be achieved or
                                                 bettered by government within the prescribed timeframes. While
                                                 budgets should be binding, policy recommendations from the
                                                 Commission should be just that - recommendations.


                                                 I support the ‘firewall’ principle, that New Zealand’s targets must be
                                                 achieved by actual cuts in our own emissions, and not through the
                                                 purchase of overseas carbon credits or an over-reliance on forests as
                                                 carbon sinks


                                                 While consensus across political parties is good, any cross-party
                                                 agreement should not be achieved at the cost of strong climate law.
                                                 Climate change is the greatest challenge facing humanity. It would
                                                 be wrong to have broad agreement on weak law, when what is

                                                 urgently needed to address the problem is strong law.

                                                 The world needs pathways to transformational change if we are to
                                                 avoid catastrophic warming. This is the scale of the challenge. The
                                                 science is clear: the only way we can succeed is with big ambition.

                                                 New Zealand must be bold and pass strong law for the sake of our
                                                 precious earth and future generations.
