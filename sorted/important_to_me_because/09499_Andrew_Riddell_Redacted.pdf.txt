A Zero Carbon Act is important to me           anthropic climate change is an existential issue for society,
because...                                     especially if the industrial era global average temperature is not kept
                                               at 1.5 degrees or below.


                                               Achieving this will require a strict 2050 target AND it will require New
                                               Zealand to revise significantly its Paris Treaty reduction
                                               commitment.


                                               In addition the legislation should set a consistent base line date or
                                               period against which reductions are measured. The previous
                                               government changed the base line date in a disingenous move to
                                               look like it was commiting to a greater reduction than it actually did.
                                               It deliberately made it hard to compare ghg emissions over different

                                               periods of time. This has undermined the country's response to
                                               climate change.

                                               The final thing that must be achieved with this Zero Carbon Act is
                                               that the reduction targets and means to get there must be in the

                                               context that the only responsible economic response is one that
                                               recognises that there are finite limits to growth because we live on
                                               one planet. This will require a different economic ideology to tghe
                                               neoliberalism we have been sugffering under for the last thrity plus
                                               years.

Q1. What process should the                    The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now. This
Government use to set a new emissions          legislation needs to ensure that the interim targets are also

reduction target in legislation?               ambitious.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050              The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for       zero by 2050 (the third option on page 23 of the discussion
New Zealand?                                   document).

                                               I also support taking a science-based approach to ensure our efforts

                                               to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible: we should aim for
                                               negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing new short-lived
                                               gases to sustainable levels, and eliminating releases of fossil short-
                                               lived gases.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its            By using domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest
targets?                                       planting), and by using inernational carboon units. International

                                               carbon untis should only be used where (a) there are very strong
                                               environmental safeguards, (b) the income from the units is used to
                                               support less developed countries, especially in the South Pacific, and
                                               (c) there is a strong social justice and fairness aspect to the
                                               distribution of income from the units.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow          The only revision of the 2050 target that would be acceptable would
the 2050 target to be revised if               be a revision where the 2050 target is to be achieved sooner, in

circumstances change?                          reponses to evidence that climate change is occurring at a faster
                                               rate than had previously been thought.

                                               The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
                                               changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. Indeed what is

                                               required is a new economics that respects the planetaryt limits to
                                               growth.

                                               However, the ability to revise the 2050 target so that it is reached
                                               earlier in light of major changes in scientific understanding or

                                               international agreements should be permitted.
Q5. The Government proposes that              Yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
three emissions budgets of five years         3 are in effect at all times.

each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be
in place at any given time. Do you agree The target reductions in these 5 yearly must be significantly stronger
with this proposal?                           than the implicit and explicit targets agreed by the previous
                                              government under the Paris Treaty.

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able Emissions budgets should not be altered in response to “economic
to alter emissions budgets?                   changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.


                                              However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                              scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                              permitted, but only to make the five yearly reduction targets more
                                              ambitious.

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed            I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

                                              economy taking into account the true costs (including externalities)
                                              of that particular sector and the likely costs of not addressing climate

                                              this means the Climiate Commission should be able to advise on

Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider         The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
in setting plans to meet budgets? For         comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and

what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that         Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.
the Climate Change Commission advises         However, the Government should be legally required to consider and

Q16. Should the Government explore

setting up a targeted adaptation

Further comments                             Climiate change cannot be effectively addressed by relying on the
                                             failed neoliberal economic ideology.
