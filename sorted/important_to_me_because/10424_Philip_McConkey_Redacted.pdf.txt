A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          I believe that my children and grand-children should have as much
because...                                    chance of a good life as I have had. This means that our government
                                              and society generally need to see that we must live in harmony with

                                              nature, rather than living as if it is simply there to be used for our
                                              benefit, including waste. Climate change is forcing us to wake up to
                                              our blind,careless way of life. We must head the warning or our
                                              species simply won't survive.

Q1. What process should the                   The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now. This
Government use to set a new emissions         is the minimum we need to do! I'm very concerned that it won't be

reduction target in legislation?              enough!
Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net

target now, which is the best target for      zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                  ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                      forest planting). No more fancy accounting! We must face the reality

                                              of the situation we have put ourselves in.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                         ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                              understanding or international agreements should be permitted.
                                              I agree wholeheartedly!

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years
                                              yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be     3 are in effect at all times.

with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to

                                              However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in

                                              scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                              permitted.

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed            I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

                                              economy

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require
                                              Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change
Governments to set out plans within a         Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan. This surely is
certain timeframe to achieve the              self-evident!

Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider        The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be

example, who do we need to work with,        reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.
the Climate Change Commission advises However, the Government should be legally required to consider and
on and monitors New Zealand's                formally respond to the Commission’s advice, and to provide an
progress towards its goals. Do you           explanation if they do not act on it. Again, this seems like a

agree with these functions?                  minimum. I feel nervous that governments will find ways to avoid
                                             what is required - all in the name of economic growth. That is the
                                             very thing which has got us into the mess we're in.

Q12. What role do you think the Climate
Change Commission should have in             The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in
relation to the New Zealand Emissions        the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to the
                                             number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests

                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,
                                             insurance and local
                                             government
                                             • risk management

                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                             • community engagement and communications.
                                             • business competitiveness
                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q15. The Government has proposed a           I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance

with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan
                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                             adaptation plan
                                             • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation

reporting power that could see some          Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Further comments                             I think that successive governments have failed to help the average
                                             citizen to move from some kind of optional 'belief' in climate change,
                                             to seeing its reality now and the need for it to be given absolute
                                             priority. Hence the need for government action not just in policy

                                             settings (vital though this is), but also in public education
                                             programmes of various kinds. These need to be tailored to counter
                                             the denials which still abound, in social media particularly. In many
                                             ways our society continues to behave as if climate change isn't
                                             happening, or it is of minor significance and we can continue to do

                                             what we want eg. we keep flying and increasing the number of
                                             flights everywhere as if it is simply not an issue.
