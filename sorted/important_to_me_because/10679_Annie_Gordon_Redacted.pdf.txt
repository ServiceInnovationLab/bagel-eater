A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          Climate change is a global problem. Climate has no borders, no
because...                                    politics, no opinions, no budget - yet it is powerful beyond measure.
                                              The Zero Carbon Act provides Aotearoa with an opportunity to

                                              demonstrate global leadership on one of the biggest challenges
                                              facing the world right now. We need to do this right. I am submitting
                                              on this bill because I want to see that this legislation is robust and
                                              ensures a positive, bright future for our grandchildren our those of
                                              our Pacific neighbours and our planet.

Q1. What process should the                   The Government should set a target for 2030 in legislation now.

Government use to set a new emissions         Climate scientists are saying to us clearly that a target of zero
reduction target in legislation?              carbon by 2050 is far too late to avert expected global warming.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for      zero by 2030. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                  ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new

targets?                                      forest planting). I do not support any scheme that aims to reach
                                              “zero carbon” by off-setting NZ’s domestic emissions through the
                                              purchase of carbon credits from other countries.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the

                                              understanding or international agreements should be permitted.
Q5. The Government proposes that
                                              yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
three emissions budgets of five years         3 are in effect at all times. There also needs to be a requirement on

with this proposal?                           times.

                                              However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                              scientific understanding or international agreements should be

Q11. The Government has proposed that
                                             Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.

Q12. What role do you think the Climate

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)

proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests
                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill       Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within

Further comments                                Climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing people in

                                                climate change is having on our neighbours in the Pacific and across
                                                the developing world. Those who have contributed least to the
                                                causes of climate change are typically the most vulnerable to its
                                                impacts and have the least resources to respond. In setting climate
                                                emissions budgets we need also to make consideration of our more

                                                vulnerable Pacific neighbours, many of them already feeling the
                                                severe impacts of climate change through flooding, cyclones and
                                                seasonal disruptions. Under the Paris Agreement, New Zealand is
                                                required to communicate to the United Nations about its
                                                international contributions.This reporting needs to be transparent.

                                                The Zero Carbon Bill must include a requirement to produce annual
