A Zero Carbon Act is important to me        it is time New Zealand committed to a detailed policy and

                                            in this country and to manage this, both mitigation and adaptation
                                            policy must be prioritised. A Zero Carbon Act is a critical element of
                                            mitigation policy; it also represents a reputational commitment when
                                            our trading partners, such as the EU, are already far ahead in specific

                                            speed with which visible climate change is occurring, then to keep to

                                            Carbon Act must require government to consider the
                                            recommendations of the Commission and to provide parliament with
                                            reasons for not accepting any recommendations.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its         By reducing domestic emissions, with exemptions (for example for

targets?                                    agriculture), and by encouraging forest planting and native

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow
the 2050 target to be revised if            No

Q5. The Government proposes that

Q11. The Government has proposed that
the Climate Change Commission advises        Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.

Further comments                             If climate change really is this generation's nuclear free moment,
                                             which I believe it is, then it is vital that a clear, bold commitment
                                             (zero carbon by 2050 or before) be made now, along with
                                             comprehensive climate change adaptation planning.
