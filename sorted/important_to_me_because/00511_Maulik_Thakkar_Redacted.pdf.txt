A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          My generation would appreciate inheriting a world that is not
because...                                    irretrievably destroyed by the avarice of large fossil fuel firms. The
                                              upcoming generation should not have to face the prospect of our

                                              ruin as a species due to increasing carbonic acid in the oceans and
                                              the deterioration of the planet's life-sustaining capacity in favour of
                                              lining the pockets of the wealthiest 1 percent of the human species.
                                              We need this law to ensure that a world still exists when my
                                              generation passes on.

                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:

Q16. Should the Government explore

setting up a targeted adaptation
reporting power that could see some          Yes
organisations share information on their
