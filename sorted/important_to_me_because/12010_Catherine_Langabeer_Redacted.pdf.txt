A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          It will enshrine a legal framework that is commensurate with the
because...                                    gravity of the problem. Climate change represents a massive
                                              existential risk for human civilisation and the ecosystems we are part

                                              of, but the scale and tone of Government response in NZ in recent
                                              years has not reflected the seriousness of the issue, or the urgency
                                              with which we need to act. Every week brings new reports of more
                                              extreme weather, which makes me increasingly worried that we are
                                              approaching tipping points in our climate system and the risk of

                                              runaway climate change. I don't want my daughter and future
                                              generations to inherit an irredeemably depleted, polluted, unstable
                                              world. We have it within our means to change course but it requires
                                              far more ambitious leadership from our political representatives, and
                                              a massive commitment to consensus building.

Q1. What process should the                   The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now. In

                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing

                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                      forest planting).

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic

                                              world fails to avoid runaway climate change.

                                              policy levers to enable these pathways, the Government should work
                                              with business, industry, NGOs, and communities to identify leading
                                              practice, risks and opportunities. Co-benefits (to public health, health

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:

Climate Change Commissioners need to          • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable       • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour

                                              I think expertise in public health, agriculture and food production are
                                              also important.
Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill
