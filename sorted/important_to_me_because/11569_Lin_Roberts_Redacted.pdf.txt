A Zero Carbon Act is important to me           A stable climate is essential for peaceful prosperous life on this
because...                                     planet. A temperature rise of 2 degrees will cause widespread
                                               misery, through displacement of people, hunger, and civil unrest.

                                               Over the last ten years New Zealand has been grossly negligent and
                                               extremely short sighted in failing to take meaningful action to reduce
                                               our emissions - it is now time to start acting responsibly - as global
                                               citizens and as people who care for the future of our children and
                                               grandchildren and the future of the planet we call home, and the

                                               future of all the other species we share it with.

Q1. What process should the
Government use to set a new emissions          The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now.
reduction target in legislation?

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050              Net zero long-lived gases by 2050, and stabilised (at a much lower
target now, which is the best target for       level) short-lived gases by 2050: I support the two basket approach
New Zealand?                                   for short and long-lived gases, but only if methane is first cut deeply
                                               and fast, to a level supported by science, and if fossil methane is put

                                               in the same basket as the other fossil fuels. We should take a
                                               science-based approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions
                                               are as impactful as possible, aiming for negative levels of long-lived
                                               gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its            By using domestic emissions reductions only. This may include
targets?                                       offsetting via new forest planting, provided there is provision for their

                                               replacement when they are harvested or lost through other causes.
                                               To enhance opportunity for simultaneous biodiversity gains, we
                                               should develop means for providing credit for smaller forest
                                               plantings, eg fenced forest fragments on farms. We should also
                                               further develop our expertise in measuring and monitoring soil

                                               carbon, so that farmers who increase their carbon content of their
                                               soils can obtain credits.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow          The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if               changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty, and allows
circumstances change?                          politicians to use the power to change the target for their own short
                                               term political ends. However, the ability to revise the 2050 target in

                                               light of major changes in scientific understanding or international
                                               agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years          Yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be
in place at any given time. Do you agree       3 are in effect at all times.
with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to

to alter emissions budgets?                    “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty. It
                                               also allows incumbent governments to curry favour with particular
                                               sectors by lessening the pressure on them to achieve reduction
                                               targets. However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major
                                               changes in scientific understanding or international agreements

                                               should be permitted.
Q8. Do you agree with the proposed            I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

the Climate Commission will need to           setting budgets:
take into account when advising on and        • scientific knowledge regarding climate change

                                              appropriate technology may be a factor in phasing but not an excuse
                                              to avoid action – if there is a need for a specific technology to

                                              achieve targets and its innovation is incentivised, it will appear).
                                              • economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the
                                              economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the
                                              economy - but not using that as an excuse to protect polluting
                                              sunset industries that need to be phased out

                                              • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on
                                              taxation, public spending and public borrowing
                                              • social circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel
                                              poverty
                                              • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy

                                              supplies and the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.
Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require

Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider         The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be

                                              Government's response must also be made publicly available.

Q12. What role do you think the Climate       The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in

Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?                      number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to          • climate change policy (including emissions trading)

have a range of essential and desirable       • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the              markets and distribution)

                                              • community engagement and communications.

                                              • business competitiveness

                                              development system.

                                              I think the 'business competitiveness' expertise needs to encompass

                                              expertise in the competitive advantages gained by companies
                                              globally that have seriously embraced sustainability and emissions
                                              reductions, and the role of investors, regulators, consumers and
                                              other stakeholders in making sustainable practice more profitable. I
                                              think expertise in public health is also important.
Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill
should cover adapting to climate            Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation
reporting power that could see some         Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
