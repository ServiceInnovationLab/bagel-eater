A Zero Carbon Act is important to me         The way humans are living is unsustainable and inequitable, and the
because...                                   result is destabilisation of the planet's systems that we and other
                                             non-human species depend on to survive. The situation has been

                                             clear for decades, we can see the beginning of the dire results
                                             already, but have still done nothing tangible to address the situation.
                                             There is no choice but to make rapid, genuine and radical change to
                                             the way we live.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its          Through the reductions in domestic emissions and not overseas

                                             risk to native ecosystems, and should rely on natural regeneration as
                                             much as possible. This is likely to be made easier as animal-based

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow        No, revisions would undermine long-term certainty (and therefore

with this proposal?

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I agree that the following factors need consideration :
considerations that the Government and • scientific knowledge regarding climate change

the Climate Commission will need to          • relevant technology

                                             protecting the status quo,

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require
Governments to set out plans within a        Yes
certain timeframe to achieve the
emissions budgets?

Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider        Honouring Te Tiriti o Waitangi, social equity and intergenerational

in setting plans to meet budgets? For        equity (i.e. more immediate reductions are fairer on future
example, who do we need to work with,        generations).
what else needs to be considered?

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:

Q16. Should the Government explore

Further comments                             There also needs to be a statutory requirement for agencies to
                                             consider and give effect to sequestration and minimising emissions.
                                             This is to remove potential for conflicting outcomes of various Acts
                                             written before the need to reduce net GHG emissions to zero was
                                             perceived (e.g. Land, Conservation, Resource Management,

                                             Transport). For example, grazing leases on west coast riverbeds
                                             administered by DOC and LINZ foreclose important carbon
                                             sequestration opportunities for the benefit of a few individuals, yet
                                             more motorways will incentivise continued use of single user
                                             vehicles. Etc.
