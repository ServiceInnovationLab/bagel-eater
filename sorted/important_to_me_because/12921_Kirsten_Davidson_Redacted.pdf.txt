A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          This is about future generations - my children and their friends and
because...                                    whanau, and the environment and all living creatures. We are
                                              currently destroying the environment and experiencing the impact of

                                              climate change - fires in Sweden today! The destruction is
                                              horrendous. We need to act now!

Q1. What process should the                   The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now. This
Government use to set a new emissions         should be an evidence-based target based on the most up to date
reduction target in legislation?              climate science, on New Zealand's international obligations and on
                                              principles of global equity, that is, we need to put into place a target

                                              that takes into account that New Zealand's emissions are high and
                                              we need to contribute fairly to this global high emitting country and
                                              problem.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             Early predictions of the impact of climate change were less than
target now, which is the best target for      current predictions. Therefore, we must consider the worst possible
New Zealand?                                  scenario and set the most ambitious target: reducing total
                                              greenhouse gases to net zero by 2040, or earlier if the IPCC’s

                                              October 2018 report provides guidance that global emissions need to
                                              be reduced faster. I also support taking a science-based approach to
                                              ensure our efforts to reduce emissions have a significant impact.
                                              Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2040, or earlier if
                                              the IPCC’s October 2018 report provides guidance that global

                                              emissions need to be reduced faster.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                      forest planting).

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The target should absolutely be revising in the light of major changes
the 2050 target to be revised if              in scientific understanding or international agreements. However,
circumstances change?                         there must be no backsliding (i.e. weakening of the target) as this
                                              will undermine long-term certainty of achieving and maintaining zero

                                              emissions, and minimising the effects of climate change.
Q5. The Government proposes that
                                              Yes, and given the urgent need for global emissions to peak by 2020,
three emissions budgets of five years         the Act could also include the requirement for the Commission to
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be     urgently set an initial 2-year Emissions Budget. This 2-year Budget
in place at any given time. Do you agree
with this proposal?                           would fit within the first 5-6 year Emissions Budget.

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to
to alter emissions budgets?                   “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.

                                              However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                              scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                              permitted.
                                              The last budget should be able to be reduced if needed to respond to
                                              emerging international evidence. The Zero Carbon Act should also

                                              permit any Government to act so NZ can emit less than budgeted.
Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

                                             economy

Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?                     The Commission must also identify the extent of regressive impacts
                                             from proposed ETS settings, and propose effective complementary
                                             policies which fairly compensate vulnerable households.
Q13. The Government has proposed that Yes, but health expertise amongst Commissioners and staffing is

proposed expertise?
                                               I propose a larger pool of Climate Commissioners so that
                                               Commissioners can be called in according to the focus area – for

                                               example, adaptation policy recommendations would require the
                                               oversight of Commissioners with Tiriti and equity expertise, local
                                               government, community and adaptation experience.

                                               priority essential expertise amongst Commissioners. Health
                                               expertise, including public health, must also be included, and it is
                                               essential that all Commissioners have equity expertise, and that
                                               equity issues are not marginalised. Finally, I consider that expertise

                                               in achieving social change is also important.

                                               It is important that vested interests are not part of the Commission,
                                               particularly those with a financial interest in maintaining the health-
                                               harming status quo. In health, we have seen too many crucial policy
                                               processes derailed by those who have a financial stake in continuing

                                               to do harm.

                                               The Commissioners should be sector experts, with a high level of
                                               standing in society.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill
should cover adapting to climate               Yes. Adaptation must be a separate advisory work stream, to avoid
                                               overtaking the Commission’s top priority climate mitigation role.
change?

Q15. The Government has proposed a             Yes. I support the following adaptation provisions (which include the
number of new functions to help us             health sector):
adapt to climate change. Do you agree          - a national climate change risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                   - a national climate adaptation plan
                                               - regular review of progress towards implementing the national

                                               adaptation plan
                                               - an adaptation reporting plan

                                               Mitigation and adaptation are often deeply interlinked – so often
                                               mitigation and adaptation can be addressed together in the same

                                               policy (e.g. housing). But care must be taken in designing adaptation
                                               policies to ensure that there are no unintended consequences
                                               leading to increased climate-damaging emissions.

                                               Adaptation must be dealt with by a separate working group, to avoid

                                               distraction from the top priority of mitigation.

                                               Also a health adaptation plan must be put in place that covers both
                                               health sector adaptation and health-protecting adaptation in other
                                               sectors.

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation               Yes, absolutely. A targeted adaptation reporting power could start

reporting power that could see some            with voluntary reporting in the first year, and require compulsory
