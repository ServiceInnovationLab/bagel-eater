A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          Because I want my children to have a great life, and I don't want
because...                                    them to pay the price of careless and greedy generations who went
                                              before them.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net

New Zealand?                                  ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new

targets?                                      forest planting).

                                              It is important to bring the agricultural emissions into the plan. In the
                                              long term humans need to move towards a plant based diet, this is
                                              going to be a necessary step as the population moves beyond 7

                                              billion, so we need to start that process now. Animal based foods
                                              need to be expensive to encourage consumers to change their
                                              habits, the price needs to reflect the cost of environmental damage
                                              that they do.


                                              A plant based diet has the real potential for big positive impact on
                                              some pretty serious problems, not only on carbon, but on human
                                              health. There is such a huge base of evidence that supports this. The
                                              benefits of adopting a plant based diet for NZ are enormous, we
                                              must include agricultural emissions in our plan, to encourage farmers

                                              to look at other ways to use their land. We can continue to feed the
                                              world, but it can be food that is nourishing, healthful,
                                              environmentally kind and profitable.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the

                                              understanding or international agreements should be permitted.
Q5. The Government proposes that

                                              However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in

                                              economy

                                              I also think that the ethics of using scientific technology, on other

                                              living beings (animals), to reduce their emissions needs to be closely
                                              scrutinised. Animal welfare needs to rank highly on our radar. Just
                                              because we can tinker with, for example, internal animal processes,
                                              doesn't mean we should.

example, who do we need to work with,
what else needs to be considered?             It is vital that all activities that result in large scale pollution are

                                              scrutinized, and that these industries are not allowed to use their
                                              size and power to diminish their responsibilities.

                                              Goverment need to plan to assist these industries to change their
                                              habits, or move in a different direction entirely. Taxpayers money,

                                              for example, could be used to encourage highly indebted dairy
                                              farmers, to move to other sources of income from their land. They

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)

                                             • community engagement and communications.

                                             • business competitiveness

                                             development system.

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important. This is because

                                             various solutions to our carbon problems could well have spin off
                                             benefits (or cause demise) to public health. This should strengthen
                                             the resolve to implement those solutions that benefit public health,
                                             this should be a considered factor, and not be ignored.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill
should cover adapting to climate             Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within

with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan
                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                             adaptation plan

                                             • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation
reporting power that could see some          Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Further comments                             I want our government to look long term, not be strongly influenced
                                             by the status quo or the supporters of such, and to accept that policy

                                             needs to encourage real lasting change. People don't like change,
                                             but without it, nothing changes. Clearly doing nothing, is not an
                                             option anymore.
