A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          Climate change is the most pressing issue of our (or, arguably, any)
because...                                    time. If we fail to address this challenge, we risk rendering New
                                              Zealand - and the Earth - unfit for human life. This issue is too

                                              important to waste time with party politics and buck passing. We
                                              need strong, binding commitments in our law to hold current and
                                              subsequent governments accountable, and drive the change that is
                                              necessary for our collective survival.

Q1. What process should the                   The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net

                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                      forest planting). International carbon credits are dodgy, and even if

                                              the credits are legitimate, it's a waste to invest in other countries'
                                              low emission economies when we could be investing in our own.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if              changes”, as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the

                                              international agreements, should be permitted.
Q5. The Government proposes that

with this proposal?

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)

have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.


                                             I am not convinced that expertise in "business competitiveness" is
                                             necessary.
