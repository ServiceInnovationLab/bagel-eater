A Zero Carbon Act is important to me            I have studied environmental science for 22 years and worked as a
because...                                      sustainability professional for almost as long. Originally, I studied the
                                                anthropogenic impact on coral reefs, on Australia's Great Barrier

                                                Reef and in Papua New Guinea, in the centre of species diversity. I
                                                have witnessed bleaching events, large-scale reef destruction from
                                                agriculture and mining activities and developed methods to assess
                                                real-life coral stress. My supervisors at the Australian Institute of
                                                Marine Science were at the forefront of doing paleoclimatic

                                                reconstructions of coral skeletons (including fossils >20,000 years
                                                old) and ocean acidification research. Us coral scientists have
                                                warned for several decades that what we are witnessing now - the
                                                whole-scale devastation of the GBR and other global reefs (with over
                                                a billion corals, or half of the Barrier Reef dead in the past 3 years

                                                alone!) - would be the result of anthropogenically-induced impacts, in
                                                particular, climate change. Being regarded as the "Cassandras" of
                                                science yet seeing our worst nightmares come true - and still being
                                                fought by the neoliberal system despite overwhelming evidence -
                                                was a devastating position to be in. I have long since changed my

                                                career to work on solutions, rather than just diagnosing the
                                                symptoms of our actions on the natural world. I have worked in the
                                                NZ government for 7 years on sustainability implementation (of
                                                Govt3 and the carbon neutral public service policies of the previous
                                                Labour Government) and energy efficiency research (as Principal

                                                Scientist at EECA). In the last 7 years, I have run the first global
                                                behaviour change research project for the International Energy
                                                Agency (www.ieadsm.org/task/task-24-phase-2/). I have dedicated
                                                my life and my career to improve environmental sustainability and
                                                feel that all of my, and many other scientists' and activists' efforts

                                                are a lost cause if we don't act immediately and decisively. There is a
                                                small chance that the GBR and other reefs can recover and survive -
                                                but our window is closing fast. I personally cannot stand by and
                                                witness us kicking off the worst and fastest mass extinction the world
                                                has ever seen, which is entirely in our hands to prevent. This is why I

                                                am strongly supporting this law.
Q1. What process should the                     The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now. The

Government use to set a new emissions           Government also needs to look at the Scandinavian "collaborative
reduction target in legislation?                governance" approach to ensure this does not become a political
                                                football. For an issue as dire and urgent as climate change, we need
                                                bi-partisan agreement to put an apolitical expert secretariat (in this
                                                case, the Climate Change Commission) in charge of setting the

                                                targets, procuring and analysing scientific evidence, setting
                                                milestones and measures and evaluate impacts of the changes every
                                                5 years, with iterations to targets and interventions being proposed.
                                                It is imperative that this process is decoupled from our political
                                                process and system and we need all parties to sign on to agree to

                                                this law.
Q2. If the Government sets a 2050              The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for       zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to

New Zealand?                                   ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                               we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                               short-lived gases to sustainable levels. I personally believe, based on
                                               my longstanding involvement with environmental science and
                                               scientists, that this may still be too little, too late. What we do over

                                               the next 5 years, which is the need to embed the Commission, the
                                               Law and its Targets in everything we do as a country (like te Tiriti)
                                               will show if we can avoid the worst. We are also in an enviable
                                               position with regards to our small size, geography and abundant
                                               resources, to take a leadership role in this transition.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its            By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                       forest planting). We have the ability to do so and should thus not be

                                               dependent on international credits. Strong efforts to "rewild" large
                                               parts of our conservation land should be a part of this.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow          The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if               changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. Economic
circumstances change?                          forecasting and modelling is no better than voodoo and skewed to
                                               benefit the powerful few. However, the ability to revise the 2050

                                               target in light of major changes in scientific understanding or
                                               international agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be      Yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
in place at any given time. Do you agree       3 are in effect at all times.

with this proposal?
Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to

to alter emissions budgets?                    “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.
                                               This would also go against my recommendation of depoliticising the
                                               process and the Commission. However, the ability to revise budgets
                                               in light of major changes in scientific understanding or international
                                               agreements should be permitted.

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed             I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

considerations that the Government and take the following factors into consideration when advising on and
the Climate Commission will need to            setting budgets:
take into account when advising on and         • scientific knowledge regarding climate change
setting budgets?                               • technology relevant to climate change
                                               • economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the

                                               economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the
                                               economy (this part needs to be watched with particular scrutiny to
                                               reduce the ability to lobby, bully or bribe the Commission)
                                               • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on
                                               taxation, public spending and public borrowing

                                               • social circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel
                                               poverty and vulnerable sectors of society.
                                               • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy
                                               supplies and
                                               the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require

Governments to set out plans within a          Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change
certain timeframe to achieve the               Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan.
emissions budgets?
Q10. What are the most important             The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
issues for the Government to consider        comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and

in setting plans to meet budgets? For        reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
example, who do we need to work with,
what else needs to be considered?            The main sectors of the community should be involved in this work.
                                             An expert secretariat, comprising experts from the government,
                                             industry, primary, research, third, and service sectors as well as

                                             community representatives for Māori, vulnerable members and
                                             minorities should do the underlying research required by the
                                             Commission to provide recommendations. A Collective Impact
                                             Approach (Kania and Kramer 2011) can provide the framework to
                                             enable cross-sectoral collaboration. My IEA DSM Task 24 work also

                                             created a "Behaviour Changer Framework" that can be used to
                                             embed a collective impact approach. This has been successfully
                                             tested, largely in the energy sector, in over 10 countries.

Q11. The Government has proposed that
the Climate Change Commission advises
on and monitors New Zealand's                Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body yet its
progress towards its goals. Do you           advice should have bipartisan impact.

agree with these functions?

Q12. What role do you think the Climate      The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in
Change Commission should have in             the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to the
relation to the New Zealand Emissions
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?                     number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)

have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests
                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,

                                             insurance and local
                                             government
                                             • risk management
                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                             • community engagement and communications.
                                             • business competitiveness

                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology
                                             development system.

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important. I also believe it is
                                             imperative to have an expert on human behaviour, particularly from

                                             a socio-ecological discipline. That is the only way to ensure that the
                                             "human aspect" (both good and bad) is considered, designed for and
                                             evaluated.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill
should cover adapting to climate             Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within
change?                                      the Climate Commission.

Q15. The Government has proposed a           I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance

number of new functions to help us           is required in terms of how local councils are involved:
adapt to climate change. Do you agree        • a national climate change risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan
                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                             adaptation plan

                                             • an adaptation reporting power
Q16. Should the Government explore

setting up a targeted adaptation
reporting power that could see some          Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Further comments                                It is extremely heartening that this has finally come to fruition, albeit
                                                extremely late in the game. I want to urge everyone involved in this

                                                work to leave politics and short-term thinking and greed out of the
                                                picture, as our world simply cannot abide any more wilful ignorance
                                                on this subject. Our natural world, and human civilisation is in your
                                                hands. Please treat this as seriously as you humanely can.
