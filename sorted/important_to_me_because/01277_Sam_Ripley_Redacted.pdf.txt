A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          The Zero Carbon Act is critically important to me, because its not
because...                                    actually FOR me. It's for the world that comes next. If the whole
                                              world stopped creating emissions today, the momentum of damage

                                              already done WILL take us into a future less hospitable than the one
                                              we know today. Each day of inaction now is paid with interest by our
                                              children and their children and generations to come.

Q1. What process should the                   The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now.
Government use to set a new emissions         Understandably this is more easily said than done- but the fact is
reduction target in legislation?              that future generations will not thank us for our inaction.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             Beyond a shadow of a doubt, the most ambitious target. New
target now, which is the best target for      Zealand must reduce total greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050.

New Zealand?
                                              I also support taking a science-based approach to ensure our efforts
                                              to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible: we should aim for
                                              negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases
                                              to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new

targets?                                      forest planting), and by considering new innovations across all
                                              sectors and industries that generate greenhouse gasses. Achieving
                                              net zero emissions is not about setting lower ceilings on growth, its
                                              about growing smarter and finding co-benefits with other strategies.


                                              For instance, a shift towards renewable energies and distributed
                                              energy storage lowers New Zealand's emissions, AND makes us
                                              more resilient to the storms and earthquakes that are a daily reality
                                              of life in these beautiful islands.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the

circumstances change?                         ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                              understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years         yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - again, emissions budgets should not be altered in response to

to alter emissions budgets?                   “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.
                                              However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                              scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                              permitted.
Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

the Climate Commission will need to          setting budgets:

                                             economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the

                                             economy
                                             • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on
                                             taxation, public spending and public borrowing
                                             • social circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel

                                             the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require

Q10. What are the most important

issues for the Government to consider        The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be

example, who do we need to work with,        reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that

Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?                     number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:

Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests
                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori

                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,
                                             insurance and local

                                             • risk management
                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure

                                             • community engagement and communications.
                                             • business competitiveness

                                             development system.


                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill       Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within
should cover adapting to climate             the Climate Commission, but again if Aotearoa is to be a place of
change?                                      prosperity in the decades ahead, there is no choice but to adapt. If
                                             all global greenhouse gas emissions ceased today- the momentum
                                             created by existing gasses will STILL carry us into a difficult future of
                                             stronger storms, higher seas, embattled ecosystems, and greater

                                             heat stress on infrastructure and human health alike. That is our
                                             reality. We cannot turn from it. We adapt, or we lose.
Q15. The Government has proposed a             I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance
number of new functions to help us             is required in terms of how local councils are involved:

adapt to climate change. Do you agree          • a national climate change risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                   • a national adaptation plan
                                               • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                               adaptation plan
                                               • an adaptation reporting power


                                               Beyond this, let's recognise what's already happening. Local
                                               governments are beginning to take ownership of adaptation,
                                               because they'll be the first to pay the costs. Some cities and
                                               communities are moving faster than other, but that is part of how

                                               Central Government and the Zero Carbon Act can help by creating
                                               national direction and regulatory certainty as a means for coping
                                               with the harsher climate reality we face in our future.

Q16. Should the Government explore             Yes. Our society is increasingly data-rich, and that data can be used

Further comments                               We all have a part to play in forging a brighter future in spite of a
                                               harsher climate. My own choices as an individual, though minutely
                                               measurable, are still part of the equation. Such is true of my
                                               neighbours, my friends, people I've never met, and of you, whoever
                                               is reading this. We should never underestimate the power of the

                                               small, each of us counts and each of us matters. This is true of each
                                               person, and it is true of this incredible nation. New Zealand may not
                                               lead the world in causing the problems of climate change, but we
                                               can lead in confronting those problems. The Zero Carbon Act will
                                               help pave the way.


                                               To those with the power to make the Zero Carbon Act a reality, I ask
                                               you, not for me, not for you, but for those you love and for those you
                                               want to live happy, healthy, prosperous lives- Act now. Your children
                                               can't afford to wait.
