A Zero Carbon Act is important to me           We have been aware of the likely effects of climate change since
because...                                     1988. We now see them almost daily, including the human migration
                                               effects. While it is the biggest problem ever faced by humankind,

                                               there is some reason to think that we can make some steps to
                                               improve the future if we transform our energy systems, our many
                                               economies and our international relations. A few months ago our first
                                               grandchild arrived, and as she grows so must our commitment to
                                               climate change action. The biggest struggle is to leave many old

                                               economic ideas behind, divest from fossil fuels, and rapidly change
                                               our energy, transport and food systems to meet the challenge.
                                               Everything about our political system must change in a radically
                                               different century of climate and energy.

Q1. What process should the                    The Government should set an emissions reduction target for 2050 in
Government use to set a new emissions          legislation now. This must be based on the best scientific advice, not

reduction target in legislation?               compromised, and have support from all parties in the parliament.
                                               Government coalition members must work to achieve this with
                                               National.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050              The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for       zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                   ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                               we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing

                                               short-lived gases to sustainable levels.
                                               This means the agriculture sector must be included. The farmers
                                               arguments about balance between farming and the environment are
                                               not relevant. We must change our economic activities to support the
                                               climate, that is more than our life blood.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its            By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new

targets?                                       forest planting). The last government sought to avoid our
                                               international obligations and protect some damaging farming by
                                               using purchase of suspect, international carbon credits under the
                                               ETS. Our reputation was left in tatters. This sort of dishonesty must
                                               not be revisited.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow          No, the 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic

the 2050 target to be revised if               changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                          ability to revise the 2050 target in light of changes in scientific
                                               understanding or international agreements should be permitted. This
                                               would only be in the case where ongoing climate change monitoring
                                               and the science indicates that the threat is greater, and emissions
                                               and energy use needs to be reduced more than previously thought.

                                               This situation has already happened, because the IPCC report
                                               process is too infrequent for a dynamic problem like climate change.

Q5. The Government proposes that               No - the climate system that is driving climate change is difficult to
three emissions budgets of five years          capture with any accurate mathematical model. Approximations
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be have to be used, and many scientists err on the side of caution, so
in place at any given time. Do you agree that reports are slow in relation to real change. However non IPCC

with this proposal?                            results can become available in shorter time frames, so we need to
                                               be able to respond as a government and a nation. Emissions budgets
                                               should be reviewed annually, and publicly reset whenever it is
                                               necessary. At any one time, a series of 12 annual carbon budgets
                                               would be in place. Whenever the scientific understanding improves,

                                               the budget series should be adjusted as required to ensure we can
                                               meet the 2050 target. Energy budgets should also be used and
                                               reported.
Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - Governments are creatures that relate to short term economic
to alter emissions budgets?                    forecasts and changes, operating in the three year cycle of elections.

                                               Carbon budgets can only be helpful to business and communities if
                                               they are reliable in the longer term - 12 to 20 years Emissions
                                               budgets should not be altered in response to “economic changes” as
                                               this undermines their long-term certainty. However, the ability to
                                               revise budgets in light of changes in scientific understanding or

                                               international agreements should be permitted. The only other
                                               exceptions should be for a region suffering from an earthquake or a
                                               volcanic eruption damage.

                                               Government can change energy and carbon reduction policies, as

                                               long as they support the carbon emissions budgets.
Q8. Do you agree with the proposed             The Government and the Climate Commission should take the

                                               and local government.

Q11. The Government has proposed that Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.
the Climate Change Commission advises However, the Government should be legally required to consider and

agree with these functions?                    This would be using a public report on progress from the commission

                                               on a regular basis.

Q12. What role do you think the Climate        The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in
Change Commission should have in               the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to the
relation to the New Zealand Emissions
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?                       number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.

Q13. The Government has proposed that Amended - collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to           • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable        • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour

expertise. Do you agree with the               markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                            • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests

                                               • risk management
                                               • engineering and infrastructure, including key expertise in electrical

                                               and mechanical engineering, relating to expansion of electric
                                               vehicles, roof top solar, power storage and electricity grid flexibility.

                                               I think expertise in population and immigration and public health is
                                               also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill
should cover adapting to climate               Yes. This will require a separate adaptation sub-committee within the
change?                                        Climate Commission.
Q15. The Government has proposed a            I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance
number of new functions to help us            is required in terms of how local councils are involved:

adapt to climate change. Do you agree         • a national climate change risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                  • a national adaptation plan
                                              • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                              adaptation plan
                                              • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation

reporting power that could see some           Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Further comments                              The government will need to look at how taxation reform will play its
                                              part in making NZ more fair so that more public investment can be
                                              made in the zero carbon plan, up to the end of this century. The

                                              present inequality system will not do it. As the Government will be
                                              responsible for the policy and sector plans, it will need a lot more
