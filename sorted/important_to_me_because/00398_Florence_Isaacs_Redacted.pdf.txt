A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          This is the bare minimum we can do as a country to reduce our

                                              climate change. I am an early career climate scientist, and my

                                              research focuses on the profound effects of climate change on
                                              Antarctic sea ice and the Antarctic climate system. It has been
                                              devastating learning precisely how our planet is changing and will
                                              continue to change as a result of our shortsighted and reckless
                                              reliance on fossil fuels. A Zero Carbon Act would allow us to move

                                              away from this current mode of operation, and transition our society
                                              into a more sustainable future. Having these goals realised within a
                                              regulatory framework gives them a legitimacy that they have not yet

                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic

                                              acknowledging that climate change disproportionately affects
                                              oppressed and marginalised groups in our society. It is imperative
                                              that the Government works with these groups when setting
                                              emissions reduction plans.

 Q11. The Government has proposed that

 Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:

 Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
 have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour

                                              I think expertise in public health is also important.
