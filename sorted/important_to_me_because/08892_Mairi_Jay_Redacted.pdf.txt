A Zero Carbon Act is important to me         It's a piece of legislation that has the potential to fulfil NZ's
because...                                   commitments to the Paris accord to limit greenhouse gases.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050            The most BASIC target is to reducing total greenhouse gases to net

                                             also support taking a science-based approach to ensure our efforts to
                                             reduce emissions are as impactful as possible. We should aim for
                                             negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases

                                             to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its          NZ should reduce its targets by using domestic emissions reductions
targets?                                     only (including from new forest planting).

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow        The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic

                                             yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that

Further comments                             I think there should be a national adaptation plan that sets out
                                             national targets and a regulatory framework for monitoring and
                                             reporting AND ALSO THE GUIDELINES AND MONITORING

                                             FRAMEWORK FOR REGIONAL PLANS.

                                             Central government should be prepared to assist regions which lack
                                             technical capacity to undertake and monitor emission reduction
                                             activities. For example, some regions, such as the West Coast

                                             Region, Northland Region, Gisborne District have a low rate-payer
                                             base and significant infrastructure costs which could make it difficult
                                             to undertake the necessary work required to ensure emission
                                             reduction activities.
