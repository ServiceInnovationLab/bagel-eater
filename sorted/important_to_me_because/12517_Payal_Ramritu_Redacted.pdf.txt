A Zero Carbon Act is important to me           As a future social worker, I need to take a stand for the issues that
because...                                     affect those I will work with and that undoubtedly includes climate
                                               change. The Zero Carbon Act must be fair, cost-effective,

                                               comprehensive and environmentally sustainable. It must also reflect
                                               a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi. I want the Zero Carbon Act to
                                               grow great health co-benefits and health equity in NZ, and the
                                               Climate Change Commission to include Commissioners and staff who
                                               understand climate change health impacts and opportunities now,

                                               and in future, from well-designed healthy climate action. New
                                               Zealand is a signatory to the 2015 Paris Agreement and NZ
                                               (businesses, iwi, communities, whānau, households, and the health
                                               sector) need certainty and transparency to act fast now.

Q1. What process should the                    The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now, with
Government use to set a new emissions          the ability to make the target stronger in response to the

reduction target in legislation?               Commission’s early advice. The target should be based on the most
                                               up to date climate science, on our international obligations and on
                                               principles of global equity (New Zealand is a wealthy, high emitting
                                               country and should do its fair share).

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050              An ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net zero by
target now, which is the best target for       2040 or earlier if the IPCC’s October 2018 report provides guidance
New Zealand?                                   that global emissions need to be reduced faster. I also support taking

                                               a science-based approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions
                                               are as impactful as possible: we should aim for negative levels of
                                               long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable
                                               levels. What matters is total net emissions in our atmosphere and
                                               oceans – so we do not breach crucial ecological tipping points.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its            Domestic net emissions reductions only (including from

targets?                                       reforestation, horticultural planting and improved soil health).
                                               Relying on international tradeable emissions units means NZ misses
                                               out on opportunities for wellbeing and equity co-benefits of reducing
                                               our domestic emissions. This means delaying the real changes for
                                               later, when they may be poorly planned and rapidly executed, with

                                               fewer co-benefits and greater likelihood for negative unintended
                                               consequences than well thought out plans starting now. Our main
                                               focus must be rapidly reducing NZ’s greenhouse gas emissions – all
                                               gases, all sectors. NZ (businesses, iwi, communities, whānau,
                                               households, and all sectors including the health sector) needs

                                               certainty to act decisively now.
Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow          The 2050 target must not be altered in response to “economic

the 2050 target to be revised if               changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                          ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                               understanding or international agreements should be permitted. The
                                               target should only be altered to increase climate action ambition in
                                               response to updated scientific recommendations. There must be no

                                               backsliding (i.e. weakening of the target).

Q5. The Government proposes that               Yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
three emissions budgets of five years          3 are in effect at all times. Given the urgent need for global
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be emissions to peak by 2020, the Act could also include the
in place at any given time. Do you agree requirement for the Commission to urgently set an initial 2-year
with this proposal?                            Emissions Budget. This 2-year Budget would fit within the first 5-6

                                               year Emissions Budget.
Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to
to alter emissions budgets?                    “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.

                                               The last budget should be able to be reduced if needed to respond to
                                               emerging international evidence. The Zero Carbon Act should also
                                               permit any Government to act so NZ can emit less than budgeted.
                                               However, emissions budgets can not be increased, unless the
                                               Government changes the Act through the usual Parliamentary

                                               process.
Q8. Do you agree with the proposed             I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

the Climate Commission will need to            setting budgets:

                                               economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the
                                               economy
                                               • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on
                                               taxation, public spending and public borrowing

                                               the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require        Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change
Governments to set out plans within a          Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan. The Zero

certain timeframe to achieve the               Carbon Act must require the Government to respond by publishing
emissions budgets?                             plans to stay within budget as rapidly as feasible, within a set time
                                               limit that is certainly less than 12 months.

Q10. What are the most important               The Government must work in Te Tiriti partnership, and with NZ’s
issues for the Government to consider          most vulnerable communities (those already disadvantaged and
in setting plans to meet budgets? For          those working in high-emissions industries), to create a hopeful,

example, who do we need to work with,          fairer future. The substantial co-benefits to health from well-designed
what else needs to be considered?              reduction and mitigation must be considered. Other considerations
                                               include sustainable economic opportunities and technology relevant
                                               to climate change, to grow a fairer, just, sustainable Aotearoa-NZ.
                                               The direct and indirect health effects of climate change will have a
                                               greater impact on those already suffering from disadvantage and

                                               poorer health in New Zealand – children, elderly, low-income, Māori
                                               and Pacific populations, and people living with disabilities, acute or
                                               chronic illnesses. Climate action that prioritises health equity has
                                               significant potential to reduce existing, and prevent future health
                                               inequities (e.g. retrofitting insulation to make homes warm and dry

                                               can reduce childhood asthma and chest infections – as leading

                                               children).

Q11. The Government has proposed that Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.

Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?                       Commission must also identify the extent of regressive impacts from
                                               proposed ETS settings, and propose effective complementary
                                               policies which fairly compensate vulnerable households.
Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to           • climate change policy (including emissions trading)

have a range of essential and desirable        • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the               markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                            • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests
                                               • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
                                               • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,

                                               government
                                               • risk management
                                               • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                               • community engagement and communications.

                                               • business competitiveness
                                               • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology
                                               development system.

                                               It is important that vested interests are not part of the Commission,

                                               particularly those with a financial interest in maintaining the health-
                                               harming status quo. In health, we have seen too many crucial policy
                                               processes derailed by those who have a financial stake in continuing
                                               to do harm. In addition to climate science, I see mātauranga Māori;
                                               Te Tiriti O Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests
                                               as high priority essential expertise amongst Commissioners. Health

                                               expertise must also be included, and it is essential that all
                                               Commissioners have equity expertise, and that equity issues are not
                                               marginalised. Finally, I consider that expertise in achieving social
                                               change is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill
should cover adapting to climate               Yes. Adaptation must be a separate advisory work stream, to avoid
                                               overtaking the Commission’s top priority climate mitigation role.

Q15. The Government has proposed a             I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance
number of new functions to help us             is required in terms of how local councils are involved:
adapt to climate change. Do you agree          • a national climate change risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                   • a national adaptation plan
                                               • regular review of progress towards implementing the national

                                               adaptation plan
                                               • an adaptation reporting power

                                               Mitigation and adaptation are often deeply interlinked – so often
                                               mitigation and adaptation can be addressed together in the same

                                               policy (e.g. housing). But care must be taken in designing adaptation
                                               policies to ensure that climate-damaging emissions are not
                                               increased.

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation               Yes. A targeted adaptation reporting power could start with voluntary
reporting power that could see some            reporting in the first year, and require compulsory reporting in
organisations share information on their subsequent years.
