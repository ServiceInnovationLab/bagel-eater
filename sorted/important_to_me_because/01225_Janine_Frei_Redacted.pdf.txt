A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          We need it for our survival and a thriving ecosystem for future
because...                                    generations to enjoy

Q1. What process should the
Government use to set a new emissions         The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now. If
                                              not 2040! The sooner the better.
reduction target in legislation?
Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net

target now, which is the best target for      zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                  ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                      forest planting). Start living up to the 100% pure brand, right now it’s

                                              an outright lie. Refusing the focus on dairy!!! Less dairy, more
                                              investments in innovation and technology for sustainable business!
                                              Revive New Zealand’s native species.. stop cutting down trees,
                                              innovate for new environmentally friendly ways to coexist with in all
                                              industries especially in building. Focus more on made in NZ branding

                                              and higher taxes on imports of products from China and other
                                              countries selling items of extreme low quality and high footprint, no
                                              tax on zero footprint products imported from abroad.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                         ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific

                                              understanding or international agreements should be permitted.
Q5. The Government proposes that

three emissions budgets of five years         yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be     3 are in effect at all times.
in place at any given time. Do you agree
with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to
to alter emissions budgets?                   “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.

                                              However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                              scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                              permitted.

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed            I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should
considerations that the Government and take the following factors into consideration when advising on and
the Climate Commission will need to           setting budgets:

take into account when advising on and        • scientific knowledge regarding climate change
setting budgets?                              • technology relevant to climate change
                                              • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy
                                              supplies and
                                              the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.


                                              All these points are actually irrelevant when Wellington is
                                              underwater due to rise in sea levels. You can get as analytical as you
                                              want but Mother Nature will take its toll if we don’t act fast. Stop
                                              comparing fiscal scores and start coming up with laws for long term!

                                              Winters will get colder and summers warmer.. we need more action
                                              and less chit chat.

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require
Governments to set out plans within a         Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change
certain timeframe to achieve the              Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan.
emissions budgets?
Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider        The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be

in setting plans to meet budgets? For        comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and
example, who do we need to work with,        reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that
the Climate Change Commission advises
on and monitors New Zealand's                Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.
progress towards its goals. Do you

agree with these functions?

Q12. What role do you think the Climate      The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in
Change Commission should have in             the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to the
relation to the New Zealand Emissions
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?                     number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)

have a range of essential and desirable      • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests
expertise. Do you agree with the             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga
proposed expertise?                          • risk management
                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                             • community engagement and communications.

                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology
                                             development system.

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important. That said...
                                             housing in this country is appalling. Energy waste is HUGE!! Nz needs

                                             to bring laws in place to protect the people. Double glazing and
                                             insulation is a must. Increase in rent should be illegal for these kinds
                                             of renovations. It’s time home owners stopped exploiting the
                                             property market and a safe and healthy home is not put in last place.
                                             Again, with climate change happening, we need safe and warm

                                             homes. Less energy wasted.
Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill       Not really. The climate will continue to worsen.. even with a zero

should cover adapting to climate             carbon bill in place. This will be our part in saving our wonderful
change?                                      world and hopefully others will follow. Rwanda is completely plastic
                                             free.. we need to follow this example too. It’s time to pull the breaks
                                             on capitalism.., we are destroying our beautiful planet.

Q15. The Government has proposed a           I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance
number of new functions to help us           is required in terms of how local councils are involved:

adapt to climate change. Do you agree        • a national climate change risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan
                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                             adaptation plan
                                             • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore

setting up a targeted adaptation
reporting power that could see some          Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Further comments                             As a citizen I often feel defeated. I do not feel like I have the ability to
                                             make great change. As a government we do! We need to start
                                             seeing the bigger picture here.. New Zealand is not 100% pure. It’s

                                             time to step up and do the right thing, we will need to sacrifice and
                                             we may need to suffer, but in the end.. if we don’t fight, we all lose.
