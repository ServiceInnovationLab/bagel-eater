A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          Climate change is one of the most difficult challenges humanity will
because...                                    face, and like many things in life it is easier to procrastinate about
                                              the difficult decisions until it is too late. To mitigate the possibility of

                                              further procrastination it is imperative to Legislate. Legislation will
                                              provide an consistent structure for all citizens, businesses etc to
                                              utilise and do what is necessary and essential. Legislation like a Zero
                                              Carbon Act is not only a no brainer but essential to the continued
                                              enjoyment of much of the worlds resources, including oil and other

                                              greenhouse contributors.

Q1. What process should the                   Employ climate scientists from around the globe including NZ. This
Government use to set a new emissions         issue isn't limited to us, but we can be the shining light for the rest of

                                              world for our future generations. The Government should set a target
                                              for 2050 in legislation now.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for      zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to

New Zealand?                                  ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest
targets?                                      planting) but also by think on a grander scale and conceptualise how
                                              the legislation framework could be expanded into other areas of the

                                              world.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the

                                              scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                              ensured.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years
                                              yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be     3 are in effect at all times.

with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to

                                              However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in

                                              scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                              permitted.

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed            I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

the Climate Commission will need to           setting budgets:

                                              economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the
                                              economy
                                              • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on

                                              supplies and the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.
Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require      Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change
Governments to set out plans within a        Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan. But if this is

certain timeframe to achieve the             the case, then perhaps allowance for easier revision to this within the
emissions budgets?                           first few years should be considered.

Q10. What are the most important             The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
issues for the Government to consider        comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and

                                             hindered by these decisions.

Q11. The Government has proposed that
the Climate Change Commission advises        Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body. But it

progress towards its goals. Do you           could have a voting percentage in the decision making process.

Q12. What role do you think the Climate

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)

proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests
                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori

                                             • community engagement and communications.

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation

exposure to climate change risks?

                                                'overwhelmed'. 'Not owning it' is an easy way out for most people
