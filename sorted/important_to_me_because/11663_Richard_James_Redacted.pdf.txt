A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          We need to do something, "following closely" is not the NZ way. We
because...                                    are leaders and the rest of the world is watching. We have a
                                              beautiful country and need to start respecting it or we will lose it. We

                                              just need to rethink how we live and start looking after our paradise.
                                              We can also do it for our children.

Q1. What process should the                   The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now.
Government use to set a new emissions         The USA was ambitious in setting a goal to get to the moon, then set
reduction target in legislation?              about realizing that goal. This is our time to set an ambitious goal.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for      zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                  ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:

                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                      forest planting). We should look at how small efforts can be
                                              recognized on a bigger scale. If a farmer is producing methane but
                                              also doing riparian planting (which is a carbon sink and good for

                                              water quality) they should be rewarded for the good. Lots of Riparian
                                              planting in a catchment adds up to a forest.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                         ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                              understanding or international agreements should be permitted. The

                                              progress to net zero may not involve steady reductions. Reductions
                                              may be large at time when new technologies or ideas start being
                                              used.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be     yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
in place at any given time. Do you agree      3 are in effect at all times.

with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to
to alter emissions budgets?                   “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.
                                              However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                              scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                              permitted.

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed            I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

considerations that the Government and take the following factors into consideration when advising on and
the Climate Commission will need to           setting budgets:
take into account when advising on and        • scientific knowledge regarding climate change
setting budgets?                              • technology relevant to climate change
                                              • economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the

                                              economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the
                                              economy
                                              • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on
                                              taxation, public spending and public borrowing
                                              • social circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel

                                              poverty
                                              • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy
                                              supplies and
                                              the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.
Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require
Governments to set out plans within a        Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change

certain timeframe to achieve the             Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan.
emissions budgets?

Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider        The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
in setting plans to meet budgets? For        comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and
example, who do we need to work with,        reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that
                                             Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.
the Climate Change Commission advises        However, the Government should be legally required to consider and
on and monitors New Zealand's                formally respond to the Commission’s advice, and to provide an
progress towards its goals. Do you
agree with these functions?                  explanation if they do not act on it.

Q12. What role do you think the Climate
Change Commission should have in             The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in
                                             the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to the
relation to the New Zealand Emissions        number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests

                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,
                                             insurance and local
                                             government
                                             • risk management

                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                             • community engagement and communications.
                                             • business competitiveness
                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology
                                             development system.


                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill       Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within
should cover adapting to climate
change?                                      the Climate Commission.

Q15. The Government has proposed a           I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance
number of new functions to help us           is required in terms of how local councils are involved:

adapt to climate change. Do you agree        • a national climate change risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan
                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                             adaptation plan
                                             • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation

reporting power that could see some          Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Further comments                                 Councils spending rate payers money on infrastructure that will/
                                                 could be lost to sea level rise is not a wise spend of our money. How

                                                 councils retreat from sea level rise and how they are held
                                                 accountable (think leaky homes) is an important issue. It is the rate
                                                 payers that will pay if legal action is taken against the councils, some
                                                 of which have tried to identify the risks of sea level rise on LIM
                                                 reports.

                                                 It is very important that the socially vulnerable are looked after
                                                 during all of the changes. Although this goes for everyone in a time
                                                 of change, there are often winners and losers during times of
                                                 change, so the change needs to be clearly identified so people can
                                                 make choices.
