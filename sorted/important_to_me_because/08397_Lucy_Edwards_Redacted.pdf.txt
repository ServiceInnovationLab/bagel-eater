A Zero Carbon Act is important to me           Climate change is real. Its effects are vast, atypical and potentially
because...                                     irreversible.


                                               Due to the effects of Climate Change, families in Alaska were not
                                               able to hunt for food in the usual way last winter, as for the first time
                                               in around 90 years, the sea didn’t freeze over. Recent forest fires in
                                               Portugal, Spain and Canada have been unprecedented and storms
                                               and severe weather patterns throughout the USA and the Pacific

                                               have been more frequent and more severe. Villagers of Vunidogoloa
                                               in Fiji became the first to relocate an entire community to new lands
                                               due to rising sea levels and coastal erosion. 25% of the Great Barrier
                                               Reef disappeared in 2016 alone due to coral bleaching and in the
                                               past 40 years, 50% of all marine life has died. Certain diseases are

                                               spreading, lakes are shrinking, permafrost is melting and
                                               productivity in warmer countries is decreasing. Kiribati may be
                                               underwater by 2050.

                                               New Zealand, whilst boasting a clean green and pure image, has

                                               contributed to these effects. Our net emissions have increased by
                                               about 54 per cent since 1990, due to deforestation and an increase
                                               in gross emissions. Our current targets are not binding, our policy to
                                               meet those targets appears non-existent and our government is
                                               unaccountable. We need strong binding targets for emission

                                               reduction in order to protect our environment for future generations
                                               and have any hope of meeting our international commitments. And
                                               we need to act now to prevent the worst effects of climate change
                                               being realised. A Zero Carbon Act would not only safeguard New
                                               Zealand’s future, but that of communities in the developing world

                                               who are already on the frontline of climate change.

                                               As highlighted in a recent report commissioned by Westpac, Unless
                                               action is taken now, the public faces an unnecessarily expensive deal
                                               to make the shift to a low-carbon economy. A strong Zero Carbon Act

                                               would be the first step in taking the necessary action.

                                               we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing

                                               short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its            By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow          The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
