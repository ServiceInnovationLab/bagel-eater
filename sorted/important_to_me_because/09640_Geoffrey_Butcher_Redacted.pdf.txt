A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          Failure to achieve zero carbon is one of the largest risks to humanity.
because...                                    As an economist I've read various reports (from Stern onwards)
                                              which convince me that achieving zero carbon by 2050 is the most

                                              economically effective way, which to me means also the most
                                              sustainable way, for humanity to provide for it's future. The costs of
                                              achieving zero carbon will probably be very high and will require
                                              development of new technologies as well as new ways of thinking
                                              and acting by the community. However, the costs of NOT achieving

                                              zero carbon are likely to be much higher, and will take the form of
                                              massive civil works to cope with sea level rise, massive social
                                              disruption as communities, and in some case entire small nations,
                                              have to relocate, and much higher levels of storm damage as
                                              average storm-strength increases.

Q1. What process should the                   The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now. It

Government use to set a new emissions         should do as everything it can to get multi-party support, short of
reduction target in legislation?              watering down the emmission reduction targets.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for      zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                  ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest

targets?                                      planting), and by using foreign emissions reductions ONLY if it can be
                                              conclusively shown that these reductions are genuine and would not
                                              happen without NZ intervention.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                         ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific

                                              understanding or international agreements should be permitted.
Q5. The Government proposes that

three emissions budgets of five years         ABSOLUTELY. I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be     advance, so that 3 are in effect at all times.
in place at any given time. Do you agree
with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able Only if there is a change in scientific understanding, or a change in
to alter emissions budgets?                   international agreements which require earlier achievement of zero

                                              carbon..

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed            I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should
considerations that the Government and take the following factors into consideration when advising on and
the Climate Commission will need to           setting budgets:
take into account when advising on and        • scientific knowledge regarding climate change
setting budgets?                              • technology relevant to climate change

                                              • economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the
                                              economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the
                                              economy. THIS MUST ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE EFFECTS OF
                                              NOT ACHIEVING ZERO CARBON.
                                              • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on

                                              taxation, public spending and public borrowing
                                              • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy

                                              the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.
Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require
Governments to set out plans within a        Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change

certain timeframe to achieve the             Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan.
emissions budgets?

Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider        The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
in setting plans to meet budgets? For        comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and
example, who do we need to work with,        reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that
                                             Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.
the Climate Change Commission advises        However, the Government should be legally required to consider and
on and monitors New Zealand's                formally respond to the Commission’s advice, and to provide an
progress towards its goals. Do you
agree with these functions?                  explanation if they do not act on it.

Q12. What role do you think the Climate
Change Commission should have in             The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in
                                             the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to the
relation to the New Zealand Emissions        number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests

                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,
                                             insurance and local
                                             government
                                             • risk management

                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                             • community engagement and communications.
                                             • business competitiveness
                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology
                                             development system.


                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill       No. That is a separate matter to be addressed by separate policy
should cover adapting to climate
change?                                      and, if necessary, bills.

Q15. The Government has proposed a           I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance
number of new functions to help us           is required in terms of how local councils are involved:

adapt to climate change. Do you agree        • a national climate change risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan
                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                             adaptation plan
                                             • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation

reporting power that could see some          Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
