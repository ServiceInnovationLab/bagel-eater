A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          The prospect of maybe 600ppm CO2 in the air and perhaps 70mm of
because...                                    sea level rise is daunting enough. The prospect of my children and
                                              grandchildren living or getting killed in the ensuing conflicts that

                                              would inevitably take place over food, water, living space and heat
                                              exhaustion are too horrifying to contemplate. No one, in my opinion,
                                              can say that NZ is safe from this or that it does not apply to us. If we
                                              have any morals then it's our duty to lead, not do the least we can
                                              get away with.

Q1. What process should the                   The Government could set a target for 2050 in legislation now, but

Government use to set a new emissions         maybe thats too vague and distant for 4 year politicians. The policy
reduction target in legislation?              should be to beat that. Legislative targets need to be more specific
                                              and measurable and framed on an annual basis. In the manner of
                                              workplace performance contracts. A template that can be mandated
                                              on businesses and local authorities, else it will not happen

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             Reducing total greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050 may not be
target now, which is the best target for      agressive enough. I support taking a science-based approach to

New Zealand?                                  ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels and adopting continuous
                                              reduction strategies with a target of zero. If the target is not zero
                                              then human nature is that no action will be taken untill emissions

                                              breach any non-zero tolerance level. Such behaviour can be seen in
                                              appliance and engine efficiency.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           First lead by example using domestic emissions reductions (including
targets?                                      from new forest planting). Also mandate government and business
                                              sourcing and investment strategies such that only suppliers
                                              achieving approved levels of pollution and other ethical standards

                                              are eligible to tender.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                         ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                              understanding or international agreements should be permitted. Any
                                              attempt to play the "too expensive" or "too hard" card should be

                                              strenuously resisted.
Q5. The Government proposes that

three emissions budgets of five years         Not agressive enough - Budgets should be 4 years set 4-8 years in
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be advance to coincide with goverments contract with the electorate.

with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able Yes but only downwards - experience shows that sovereign
to alter emissions budgets?                   governments persistently fail to acheive financial budgets on

                                              projects such as contruction, IT and defence, often by huge margins.
                                              A carbon emission target is something we cannot fail to achieve at
                                              any financial cost. We need to think of it as a "total war" situation
                                              against a threat to civilization itself.
Q8. Do you agree with the proposed            I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require       We must learn from both the successes and shortcomings of the UK's
Governments to set out plans within a
certain timeframe to achieve the              Climate Change Act, together with those of other committed
emissions budgets?                            sovereign states and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan.

Q10. What are the most important

issues for the Government to consider         The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
in setting plans to meet budgets? For         comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and
example, who do we need to work with,         reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that
the Climate Change Commission advises
                                              Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body, with

agree with these functions?

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:

Climate Change Commissioners need to          • climate change policy (NOT including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable       • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour

                                              • community engagement and communications.

                                              I think expertise in public health is also important because of the
                                              known and unknown effects of outdoor and indoor CO2 especially as
                                              they approach 600ppm .
