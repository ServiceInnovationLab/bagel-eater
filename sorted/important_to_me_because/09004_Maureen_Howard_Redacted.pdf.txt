A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          Obviously, like everyone else I desperately want a stable climate!
because...                                    This cannot happen unless governments step up their game right
                                              now and bring in strong, bold and binding legislation that will support

                                              us in the transition to a zero carbon (equivalent) future.

                                              On a personal note. I am starting a business that will link businesses
                                              with landowners to grow native trees. Businesses like mine will need
                                              strong and binding legislation across government change to provide

                                              confidence for carbon sequestration business enterprises.

Q1. What process should the
Government use to set a new emissions         The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now.
reduction target in legislation?

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for      zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                  ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing

                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                      forest planting).

                                              Forest planting should be native where possible, as this helps
                                              reverse biodiversity loss (another critical issue for our planet).

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic

the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                         ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                              understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be     yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that

with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to

                                              However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                              scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                              permitted.

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed            I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

the Climate Commission will need to           setting budgets:

                                              • economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the

                                              economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the
                                              economy
                                              • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on
                                              taxation, public spending and public borrowing

emissions budgets?

Q10. What are the most important             The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
issues for the Government to consider        comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and
in setting plans to meet budgets? For
example, who do we need to work with,        reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
what else needs to be considered?            It should also aim to increase native biodiversity.

Q11. The Government has proposed that

the Climate Change Commission advises
on and monitors New Zealand's                Uncertain.
progress towards its goals. Do you
agree with these functions?

Q12. What role do you think the Climate
Change Commission should have in
                                             Uncertain.
relation to the New Zealand Emissions
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests

                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,
                                             insurance and local
                                             government
                                             • risk management

                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                             • community engagement and communications.
                                             • business competitiveness
                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology
                                             development system.


                                             I think expertise in Biodiversity protection is critical.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill       Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within
should cover adapting to climate
change?                                      the Climate Commission.

Q15. The Government has proposed a           I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance
number of new functions to help us           is required in terms of how local councils are involved:

adapt to climate change. Do you agree        • a national climate change risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan
                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                             adaptation plan
                                             • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation

reporting power that could see some          Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Further comments                                I would like to see local communities involved in the decision making
                                                in terms of adapting to climate change, and mitigating it.


                                                I definitely want us to take this challenge as an opportunity to
                                                reforest low land New Zealand with native forest and other native
                                                habitats. We are also experiencing a 6th global mass extinction, and
                                                New Zealand's wildlife is one of the most vulnerable globally.


                                                Small solutions as well as large ventures should be supported.
                                                Currently reforesting is happening in large scale. We need
                                                mechanisms whereby landowners can get access to funds for tree
                                                planting, fencing, weeding etc - on the small scale as well as large.


                                                Thank you for the opportunity to submit, and for your good
                                                consultation process.
