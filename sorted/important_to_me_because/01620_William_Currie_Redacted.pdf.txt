A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          Climate change policy and actions need a degree of long term
because...                                    consistency and stability that is not delivered well by a three year
                                              electoral cycle. This Act is needed to develop the structures and

                                              policies that will ensure progress towards the goal of carbon net zero
                                              by 2050.
                                              I think we are in a position with the opportunities provided by our
                                              physical environment and population density where we should be
                                              amongst the leading countries in achieving carbon net zero. Apart

                                              from our responsibilities to act in accordance with a clear scientific
                                              warning about the dangers of CO2 levels above 350 ppm, I think we
                                              will find enormous economic benefits to greatly reducing our
                                              dependence on imported oil and converting our economy to
                                              renewably generated electricity.

New Zealand?                                  ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new

targets?                                      forest planting). By seeing renewably generated electricity as the
                                              basic energy supply for the whole economy - from 100 % renewable
                                              generation for the existing electricity system, to progressively
                                              bringing in all forms of transport and industrial heat.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.
