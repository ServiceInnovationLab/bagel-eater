A Zero Carbon Act is important to me                If high fossil fuel emissions are allowed to continue it is unarguable that
because...                                          young people will be sentenced to either large-scale, implausible clean
                                                    up or increasing deleterious climate impacts or both (1). The annual
                                                    global temperature in 2016 was close to +1.3'C (2) . More warming is
                                                    already in the pipeline, every day that we continue to emit greenhouse

                                                    gases increases the potential for runaway climate change. We cannot
                                                    stop climate change, it is too late for that; but we can mitigate and adapt.

                                                    Part of the mitigation and adaptation scheme must include fairness, cost-

                                                    effectiveness, comprehensiveness, and environmental sustainability. It
                                                    must also reflect a strong commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi. These
                                                    issues must be focussed upon to a significantly greater extent (within the
                                                    Our Climate Your Say discussion document there is very little mention of

                                                    these core values).

                                                    For any conversation about the Zero Carbon Act the following principles
                                                    must be a part of the conversation:


                                                    Fairness means giving effect to equity considerations, such as
                                                    intergenerational justice and the principles of a “just transition”. In
                                                    practice, this means ensuring that vulnerable communities are

                                                    supported, that there is a just transition for workers in industries where
                                                    job losses will occur, and that clear signals are given as early as possible
                                                    to enable communities and businesses to plan for the impact and
                                                    opportunities of emission reduction policies (as well as the effects of

                                                    climate change, such as sea level rise). This includes those within the
                                                    dairying sector. I have great concern for students, such as those at
                                                    Lincoln university, who still feel the dream of becoming a dairy farmer
                                                    has great promise. False diatribes have convinced these people that this

                                                    is the case. We must have an accessible conversation with our future
                                                    farmers, their educational institutions and the organisations that support
                                                    those that will be part of the solution to carbon neutral food production.


                                                    Cost-effectiveness means adopting long-term strategies which minimise
                                                    cost and maximise benefits for New Zealand. This means setting targets
                                                    and plans that avoid passing the cost of transition to young and future
                                                    generations.


                                                    Comprehensiveness means taking an economy-wide approach to New
                                                    Zealand’s emission reduction strategy. The strategy must encompass all
                                                    sectors, drive coordinated decision-making and analysis across

                                                    government, and be sufficiently funded and resourced.
                                                    Environmental sustainability means considering the holistic
                                                    environmental impact of climate change policies, not only the extent of
                                                    greenhouse gas reductions.


                                                    Regarding Te Tiriti o Waitangi; the Zero Carbon Act must honour Te Tiriti
                                                    o Waitangi by giving effect to meaningful partnership between iwi and
                                                    the Crown. Zero Carbon Act targets and policies must be made

                                                    consistently with the tino rangatiratanga of iwi and hapū, as enshrined in
                                                    Te Tiriti. Climate change policies should be informed by tikanga Māori,
                                                    Māori worldviews towards climate change, and other Māori interests.


                                                    It is imperative that the Government works in partnership with iwi and
                                                    hapū to develop the Zero Carbon Bill. The Government must actively
                                                    undertake meaningful consultation with Māori on climate change issues,
                                                    and fulfil its duty under Te Tiriti to actively protect Māori rights and

                                                    rangatiratanga over their own interests.

                                                I think expertise in public health is also important.
