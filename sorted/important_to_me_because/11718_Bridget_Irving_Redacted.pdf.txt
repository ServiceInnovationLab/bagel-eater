A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          Climate Change is a huge issue, the effects of which we are already
because...                                    witnessing. In Dunedin/Otago, the impacts will be significant with
                                              large areas of the city susceptible to sea level rise, increased

                                              flooding and droughts. Our economy is underpinned by the rural
                                              community which will be increasingly under pressure due to difficult
                                              weather conditions. The areas of Dunedin exposed to sea level rise
                                              are some of the same areas where we already face significant
                                              challenges due to socio-economic conditions which will be further

                                              excerbated by climate change.

Q1. What process should the                   What gets measured gets done. The Government should set a target
Government use to set a new emissions         for 2050 in legislation now. If it does not it will continue to be a
reduction target in legislation?              moving target and create uncertainty about what needs to be done
                                              in order to hit it.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for      zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                  ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:

                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                      forest planting).

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                         ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific

                                              understanding or international agreements should be permitted. I
                                              think it is important however, that there is clarity about the
                                              magnitude of a 'major change' required in order to enable a change
                                              and perhaps changes should only be to required further reductions.
                                              This will give certainty for investors that provisions won't be relaxed,

                                              compromising investment in transition technology.
Q5. The Government proposes that

three emissions budgets of five years         yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be     3 are in effect at all times.

with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to
to alter emissions budgets?                   “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.

                                              However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                              scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                              permitted. I think it is important however, that there is clarity about
                                              the magnitude of a 'major change' required in order to enable a
                                              change and perhaps changes should only be to required further

                                              reductions. This will give certainty for investors that provisions won't
                                              be relaxed, compromising investment in transition technology.
Q8. Do you agree with the proposed            I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

the Climate Commission will need to           setting budgets:

                                              economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the

                                              economy
                                              • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require       Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change
Governments to set out plans within a         Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan. The Plan is

Q10. What are the most important              The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be

Q11. The Government has proposed that Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.

agree with these functions?                   time limits placed on them so that a Government cannot simply
                                              defer a decision indefinitely. I think it is important that the voting
                                              public have clear idea what Governments intend to do each time we

                                              go to the polls.
Q12. What role do you think the Climate       The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in

Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?                      above in relation to decisions on these policy settings.

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to          • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable       • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour

expertise. Do you agree with the              markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                           • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests

                                              • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                              • community engagement and communications.

                                              I think expertise in the following is important:
                                              - public health

                                              - Industry expertise particularly as they relate to key sectors such as
                                              farming, forestry, energy generation.
                                              - Change management - people who can provide input into how
                                              populations can be encouraged to change (e.g. move to EV's)

                                             require a separate adaptation sub-committee within the Climate
                                             Commission.

Q15. The Government has proposed a           I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance

with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan
                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national

                                             Consideration will need to be given to how these plans are then

                                             devolved to local areas as much of the adaption measures will be to

                                             authorities who are already stretched resource wise.

Q16. Should the Government explore
