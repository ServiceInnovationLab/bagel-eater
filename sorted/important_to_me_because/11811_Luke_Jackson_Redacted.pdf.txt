A Zero Carbon Act is important to me
because...                                   Sooner or later money will be the least of the business mans worries.

Q1. What process should the
Government use to set a new emissions        The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now.

reduction target in legislation?
Q2. If the Government sets a 2050            The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net

target now, which is the best target for     zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                 ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                             we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                             short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its          By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                     forest planting).

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow        The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic

the 2050 target to be revised if             changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                        ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                             understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be    yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
in place at any given time. Do you agree     3 are in effect at all times.

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to

                                             However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                             scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                             permitted.

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

                                             economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the
                                             economy
                                             • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on

                                             • social circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel

Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider        The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
in setting plans to meet budgets? For        comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and
example, who do we need to work with,        reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
what else needs to be considered?
Q11. The Government has proposed that
the Climate Change Commission advises        Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.
                                             However, the Government should be legally required to consider and

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:

Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests
                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori

                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,

                                             • community engagement and communications.

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.
