A Zero Carbon Act is important to me           As an older new zealander, I grew up in an age where the effects of
because...                                     environmental destruction was unkown, before the expansion of
                                               easily accessible knowledge, global warming and extinction of many

                                               species as a result. I did have parents who each instilled in me the
                                               belief that we all need to protect our planet and its inhabitants. As an
                                               older new zealander, I now live with respiratory issues that are quite
                                               debilitating and that restrict where I can go and what I can do. Our
                                               Health System is financially overburdened, and many health

                                               problems caused by emissions and pollution. Of our children, who
                                               are our future, many live below the poverty line without adequate
                                               housing, food and clothing, are grossly affected. It is a well
                                               established fact that emissions (of any sort) are deadly, that trees
                                               cannot cope with all the pollution going their way, deforestation is

                                               destructive to life, and that a Zero Carbon Practice would slow down,
                                               at least, this process. I fully support the Zero Carbon Bill, though I do
                                               believe the mechanisms to acheive the desired target need to be
                                               strongly enforced.

Q1. What process should the                    The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now. How
Government use to set a new emissions          is will be achieved, the steps and proof of those achievements to be

reduction target in legislation?               well documented along the way as verification of success and so
                                               diverse plans need to run alongside these to be implemented in case
                                               plan A fails.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050              The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for       zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                   ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                               we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing

                                               short-lived gases to sustainable levels. Real Education so that New
                                               Zealanders do understand and participate fully in this process.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its            By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                       forest planting). Not just, ALL emissions need to be targeted, with R
                                               & D on ways to use emissions safely for other benefits.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow          The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if               changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the

circumstances change?                          ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                               understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years          yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be
in place at any given time. Do you agree       3 are in effect at all times.
with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to

to alter emissions budgets?                    “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.
                                               However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                               scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                               permitted.
                                               Question: change and revise are too closely related. Surely one or

                                               the other?
Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should
considerations that the Government and take the following factors into consideration when advising on and

the Climate Commission will need to          setting budgets:
take into account when advising on and       • scientific knowledge regarding climate change
setting budgets?                             • technology relevant to climate change
                                             • economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the
                                             economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the

                                             economy
                                             • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on
                                             taxation, public spending and public borrowing
                                             • social circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel
                                             poverty

                                             • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy
                                             supplies and
                                             the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require
Governments to set out plans within a        Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change
certain timeframe to achieve the             Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan.
emissions budgets?

Q10. What are the most important

issues for the Government to consider        The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
in setting plans to meet budgets? For        comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and
example, who do we need to work with,        reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.
the Climate Change Commission advises However, the Government should be legally required to consider and

on and monitors New Zealand's                formally respond to the Commission’s advice, and to provide an
progress towards its goals. Do you           explanation if they do not act on it. Keeping the People of New
agree with these functions?                  Zealand fully informed along the way and listening to any and all
                                             concerns, particularly around decision making.

Q12. What role do you think the Climate
Change Commission should have in             The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in
relation to the New Zealand Emissions        the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to the
                                             number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests

                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,
                                             insurance and local
                                             government
                                             • risk management

                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                             • community engagement and communications.
                                             • business competitiveness
                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology
                                             development system.


                                             I think expertise in public health is also important. Public Health
                                             expertise needs to be included in the collective list.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill       Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within
should cover adapting to climate
change?                                      the Climate Commission.
Q15. The Government has proposed a           I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance
number of new functions to help us           is required in terms of how local councils are involved:

adapt to climate change. Do you agree        • a national climate change risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan
                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                             adaptation plan
                                             • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation

reporting power that could see some          Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Further comments                             The implications of implementing this bill and its proposed actions
                                             are enormous and all New Zealanders need to be on board. What
                                             Penalties are there for those who dont, wont, conform and breach

                                             any rules? Are destructive poisons covered, as they do affect the
                                             environment? If we do thsi, lets do it once, and well.
