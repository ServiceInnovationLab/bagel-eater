A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          Mankind (that is you and I) is making the planet uninhabitable; our
because...                                    Grandkids are inheriting a disaster. We need to make many changes,
                                              preferably years ago. This law is better late then never.

Q1. What process should the                   Not only should the Government set a target for 2050 in legislation

Government use to set a new emissions         now, but this should be incremental, with say 3 yearly targets in the
reduction target in legislation?              interim.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             Even the Pope recognizes that we need the most ambitious target:
target now, which is the best target for      reducing total greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050. I also support
New Zealand?                                  taking a science-based approach to ensure our efforts to reduce
                                              emissions are as impactful as possible: we should aim for negative
                                              levels of long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases to

                                              sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By taking all possible action now, using all the scientific knowledge
targets?                                      we have now, as well as updating all the time and including ALL
                                              polluters, all individuals and organizations that contribute to climate
                                              change need to be included. This should be treated as the national
                                              (actually international) emergency it is. All costs, financial, social,

                                              environmental of NOT doing enough need to be assessed, and widely
                                              publicized to help people understand the realities. As somebody has
                                              said, "When the ship is sinking, EVERYONE bails" But too many
                                              people still have little understanding of what is happening.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the

circumstances change?                         ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                              understanding or international agreements should be permitted. It
                                              may become MORE urgent.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be     Yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that

with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to
to alter emissions budgets?                   “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.
                                              However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                              scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                              permitted.

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed            I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

the Climate Commission will need to           setting budgets:
take into account when advising on and        • quality scientific knowledge regarding climate change
setting budgets?                              • technology relevant to climate change
                                              • we are a wealthy country; changes to the distribution of wealth

                                              would ensure that the poorer sectors are not burdened more than
                                              the rich by the costs of climate change.
                                              • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy
                                              supplies and
                                              the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require
Governments to set out plans within a         Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change
                                              Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan, AND
certain timeframe to achieve the              implementing it
emissions budgets?
Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider        The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be

in setting plans to meet budgets? For        comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and
example, who do we need to work with,        treat all people as equals.
what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that
the Climate Change Commission advises
on and monitors New Zealand's                Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body. That is
progress towards its goals. Do you           the governments job.

agree with these functions?

Q12. What role do you think the Climate      The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in
Change Commission should have in             the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to the
relation to the New Zealand Emissions
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?                     number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)

have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?
                                             • No one racial, religious or ethnic group should have any greater
                                             representation than any other.


                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,
                                             insurance and local
                                             government
                                             • risk management

                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                             • community engagement and communications.
                                             • business competitiveness
                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology
                                             development system.


                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill       Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within

Q15. The Government has proposed a           I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance

with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan
                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                             adaptation plan
                                             • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation

reporting power that could see some          Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Further comments                             Thank all involved for getting on with this. We should NOT allow any
                                             one racial, religious or ethnic group to wield more influence than
                                             others; I don't go with Maori (or pakeha, or Chinese) having their own
                                             representation. We are all in it together. It is clearly urgent, we are

                                             entering into a period of many unknowns. The Public needs WAY
                                             more accurate information, far too many folk are painfully unaware.
                                             The last ice age was caused by a lowering of the world temperature
                                             of about 5 degrees. How can we possibly think that two or three or

                                             disaster for life as we know it?
