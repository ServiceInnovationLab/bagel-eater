A Zero Carbon Act is important to me           I now have two grandchildren who I wish to live long fulfilled lives in
because...                                     sustainable prosperity on an earth where social justice prevails
                                               between all people and all the other members of the web of life.

                                               I have now been acting and hoping for this sort of commitment for
                                               my forty years plus of adulthood.
                                               The need for this act has been apparent, for at least 35 years, to
                                               those who have studied this situation. the externalization of the
                                               costs of our rampant energy consumption has been the source of our

                                               crisis now. As New Zealanders we must face the responsibility that
                                               we are amongst the most prolific emitters of green house gases per
                                               capita. We must realize that any solution must involve addressing
                                               the serious and urgent issues of social justice that are an
                                               inescapable component of the climate change crisis.

                                               we need this law to set the parameters by which all our economic
                                               activities have to operate within. there will obviously be costs . But
                                               also more certainty for responsible environmental/economic decision
                                               making. We have to acknowledge that our economy has its place as
                                               a subset of our society and be under the constraint of environmental

                                               sustainability.
                                               One of the most persuasive arguments could be that the cost of not
                                               changing fast enough will be predictably much greater than business
                                               as usual or inadequate action.

                                               emissions since 1990 and there fore must assume (as global citizens)
                                               a higher and more ambitious level of emission cuts than other

                                               one of the best positions to do so.

Q1. What process should the                    The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now to

                                               years targets leading up to 2050.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050              The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gas emissions

New Zealand?                                   approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its            By using domestic emissions reductions only for CO2 . New Zealand

targets?                                       needs to reduce its gross emissions of carbon dioxide gasses from
                                               human activities to zero by 2050, as well as absorbing them in
                                               permanent sequestration schemes such as permanent and crop
                                               forestry to offset irreducible methane and nitroxide emissions.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow          The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if               changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                          ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific

                                               understanding or international agreements should be permitted.
                                               It is becoming more apparent that the 2050 target is not ambitious
                                               enough to limit climate change to less than 1.5 degrees C

Q5. The Government proposes that

with this proposal?
Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to

                                              However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                              scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                              permitted.
                                              This crisis is so urgent that it must be treated as we would be on a

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed            I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

                                              .THE COSTS OF NO or inadequate action must be factored in.

                                              economy. this should not be the prevailing consideration. the history

                                              of NZ 's lack of action thus far is because of the overwhelming
                                              prevalence of "Business as usual" so This crisis is so urgent that it
                                              must be treated as we would be on a 'war footing'. some how when

                                              doing inadequate or no actions must also be considered.

emissions budgets?

Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider         The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
in setting plans to meet budgets? For         comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and
example, who do we need to work with,         reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that
                                              Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.
the Climate Change Commission advises         However, the Government should be legally required to consider and
on and monitors New Zealand's                 formally respond to the Commission’s advice, and to provide an
progress towards its goals. Do you
agree with these functions?                   explanation if they do not act on it.

Q12. What role do you think the Climate
Change Commission should have in              The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in
                                              the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to the

Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?
Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)

have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests
                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,

                                             insurance and local
                                             government
                                             • risk management
                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                             • community engagement and communications.

                                             • business competitiveness
                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology
                                             development system.

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill
should cover adapting to climate             Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within
                                             the Climate Commission.

                                             • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation
reporting power that could see some          Yes
organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
