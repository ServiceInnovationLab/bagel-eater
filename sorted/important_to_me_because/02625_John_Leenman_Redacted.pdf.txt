A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          Governments around the world are not doing nearly enough to bend
because...                                    the emissions curve down towards zero net emissions. Unless this is
                                              done the future will be bleak for coming generations. Already heavy

                                              rain events (as predicted) are making huge impacts and storm
                                              surges, sitting atop the existing sea level rise of 20cm, are seriously
                                              damaging coastal roads and impacting communities (cf Thames
                                              coast road and West coast SI). With recent reports of a trebling of
                                              icemelt rates in antarctica and a doubling of sea level rise rates

                                              every 7 years (in more recent times), there is no more time to lose in
                                              getting on top of GHG emissions. Robust, ambitious, courageous
                                              action is now urgently required by both central and local
                                              government.

Q1. What process should the                   The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now,
Government use to set a new emissions         building in reviewable interim targets every 5 or 10 years. Effective

reduction target in legislation?              communication of progress towards those targets needs to be
                                              included. All govt agencies and sectors in the economy MUST be
                                              included.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for      zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                  ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing

                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                      forest planting on a large scale). Developing biofuel plant to process

                                              polluting forms of transport. Require local govt, hospital fleets etc to
                                              adopt EV as far as this is possible.
                                              Provide a legislative framework to encourage renewable energy
                                              projects, both large and small (community solar/wind).

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the

                                              understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years         yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be

agree with these functions?

Q12. What role do you think the Climate

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)

proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests
                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill       Yes. Lack of meaningful action from world governments now requires

Q16. Should the Government explore

organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Further comments                             Methane, as a very potent GHG, must be included in targets. Though
                                             it is a challenging task reductions in methane, whether from
                                             livestock or the gas industry, can no longer be ignored.
