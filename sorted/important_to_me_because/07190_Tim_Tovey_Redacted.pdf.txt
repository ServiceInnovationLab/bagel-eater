A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          Well firstly I want to say thank you to whoever is reading this - thank
because...                                    you for taking the time to read and consider our thoughts! I see
                                              climate change as possibly the BIGGEST issue that we face as human

                                              kind - and at the rate we are going as a nation (and across the world
                                              as a whole) WE ARE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE! We are already
                                              experiencing the negative effects of Climate Change (more extreme
                                              weather events, species extinction and sea level rise) and it's only
                                              going to get worse.

                                              As a species, human kind MUST curb our consumption of fossil fuels
                                              and rein in our excessive carbon emissions OR WE WILL FACE
                                              SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES!!!
                                              And I believe that it needs to come through Central Government
                                              legislation, because humans generally don't change unless they are

                                              forced to. The Government needs to implement the Zero Carbon Act
                                              to give us a way forward as people, to stop relying on fossil fuels and
                                              transition in to a sustainable future - and we MUST ACT NOW!!!

Q1. What process should the                   I PASSIONATELY BELIEVE that the NZ Government should implement
Government use to set a new emissions         the Zero Carbon Bill, which requires that we as a country reach NET
reduction target in legislation?              ZERO carbon emissions by 2050.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             I STRONGLY AGREE with Generation Zero, that we should set the
target now, which is the best target for      most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net zero

New Zealand?                                  by 2050. I DEFINITELY support taking a science-based approach to
                                              ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           I think the best way NZ can meet its targets is by using domestic
targets?                                      emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting).

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         I believe that the 2050 target should not be altered in response to

the 2050 target to be revised if              “economic changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty.
circumstances change?                         However, the ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major
                                              changes in scientific understanding or international agreements
                                              should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be     YES! I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
                                              3 are in effect at all times.
in place at any given time. Do you agree
with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able Definitely not! I believe that emissions budgets should not be altered
to alter emissions budgets?                   in response to “economic changes” as this undermines their long-
                                              term certainty. However, the ability to revise budgets in light of
                                              major changes in scientific understanding or international

                                              agreements should be permitted.
Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I STRONGLY agree that the Government and the Climate Commission
considerations that the Government and should take the following factors into consideration when advising on

the Climate Commission will need to          and setting budgets:
take into account when advising on and       • scientific knowledge regarding climate change

                                             • economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the
                                             economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the

                                             economy
                                             • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on

                                             the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require      ABSOLUTELY! I agree we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's
Governments to set out plans within a
certain timeframe to achieve the             Climate Change Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a
emissions budgets?                           plan.

Q10. What are the most important             The Govt. should prioritise the most vulnerable of our society and

issues for the Government to consider        those who will be affected by the changes that Climate Change will
in setting plans to meet budgets? For        make in their lives (climate refugees and dislocation as a result of
example, who do we need to work with,        sea level rise; job loss etc.)
what else needs to be considered?            The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
                                             comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and

                                             reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.

Q11. The Government has proposed that
the Climate Change Commission advises        Yes I agree, I think the Commission should advise on and monitor
on and monitors New Zealand's
progress towards its goals. Do you           NZ's progress, but not be a decision-making body.
agree with these functions?

Q12. What role do you think the Climate      I think that the Commission should advise the Government on policy

relation to the New Zealand Emissions        respect to the number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?                     implementation.

Q13. The Government has proposed that I think all of these points are excellent suggestions and the Govt.
Climate Change Commissioners need to         should take them seriously!

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill
should cover adapting to climate             Yes! We must! I think this may require a separate adaptation sub-

Q15. The Government has proposed a           I DO agree with the proposed functions below, but I also recognise
number of new functions to help us           that nuance is required in terms of how local councils are involved:

adapt to climate change. Do you agree        • a national climate change risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan
                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                             adaptation plan
                                             • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation

reporting power that could see some          Yes, I think we should explore this option.
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Further comments                             I just want to add that I really believe this is an issue of UTMOST
                                             importance and it is CRUCIAL we act on it NOW, and I STRONGLY
                                             believe that the Zero Carbon Bill is the best way forward for NZ.
