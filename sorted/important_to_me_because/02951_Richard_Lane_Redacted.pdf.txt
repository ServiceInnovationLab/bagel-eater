A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          I am very concerned that our grandchildren, and their grandchildren
because...                                    can look forward to life in a world of natural beauty and diversity,
                                              and not fear catastrophic climate change.

                                              I recognise that as an older person I and my generation failed to take
                                              action when we should have, and despite expressing good intentions
                                              and passing legislation our emissions continued to increase. I believe
                                              it is vital that New Zealnd changes its course now.

Q1. What process should the                   The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now.
Government use to set a new emissions         Because we need to make long term changes, it is important that the

reduction target in legislation?              legislation has cross-party support, and open discussions involving
                                              the pubic will be needed to achieve.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for      zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                  ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new

targets?                                      forest planting). The use of imported credits was the chief failure of
                                              the previous ETS.
                                              NZ need to focus on the changes it must make to our economy, and
                                              to reap the benefits as well as the coasts of those changes.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the

circumstances change?                         ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                              understanding or international agreements should be permitted. This
                                              would only be by a change in the legislation in response to a
                                              recommendation of the commission.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be     yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that

with this proposal?

                                              However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                              scientific understanding or international agreements should be

                                              permitted.

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require      Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change
Governments to set out plans within a        Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan. I would

Q11. The Government has proposed that

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill       Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within

                                             • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation
reporting power that could see some          Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Further comments                             The Commission must have the membership, stature, funding, and

                                             resources to engage with and be understood and respected by the

                                             soundly based, and free from bias. This will ensure that governments
                                             heed the Commision, create and implement sound plans to meet the

                                             targets and don't interfere in it's activities.
