A Zero Carbon Act is important to me           I would like to see this world we live in continue to be livable in the
because...                                     distant future. I am all for progress and new technological
                                               advancement. However I think we should be mindful of the effects

                                               we have on the world we live in and minimise the negative effects
                                               we have it. At a minimum we should make no change to the
                                               environment.

                                               I am extremely appalled that there are now areas in this world where

                                               good quality air for breathing and drinking water is not easily
                                               obtainable due to pollution. Profit and progress at all cost is not
                                               sustainable in the long term.

                                               There's already fewer living flora and fauna, some being threatened

                                               in with extinction because no one care enough to ensure they could
                                               survive in the long term. This sort of short term thinking has to end
                                               before we lose more and ultimately end up with a planet that
                                               humans are unable to live in.


                                               Time to stop and think about what damage we are doing to this
                                               world, reduce it as much as possible so what we have left is available
                                               for many many many years to come.

                                               I also think more thought should be put into reducing carbon

                                               emissions than what is being done now.

                                               I want a world that humans can live in for thousands of years to
                                               come without requiring us to retreat into created atmospheres.

Q1. What process should the                    The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now. I
Government use to set a new emissions          would like to see wide support for this legislation, regardless of
reduction target in legislation?               where you are in the political spectrum. This target should be there

                                               regardless of who is in government.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050              The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for       zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                   ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                               we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                               short-lived gases to sustainable levels.
Q3. How should New Zealand meet its             By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                        forest planting). Emissions is not only what comes out from vehicles

                                                and burning of fuel, it comes from what is produced by waste. Waste
                                                at the end of life of a product as well as during the creation and use
                                                of a product.

                                                Are we creating unnecessary waste?


                                                We should ensure NZ as a whole work towards these targets. For
                                                example public transport should aim for low emissions vehicles and
                                                not expand their use of fossil fuels.


                                                Businesses, projects and all should include consideration towards
                                                reducing carbon emissions and reduce waste as part of their
                                                planning process. Anyone designing products or services should also
                                                include reduction and disposal at end of life and of waste and by
                                                products. Can they make something using recycled material or can

                                                the waste and end of life of what they make or create be broken
                                                down and recycled?

                                                There should also be research being done on how to reduce these
                                                emissions. For example there's one recent study finding a particular
                                                seaweed added to food cows eat reduced methane emissions. Is

                                                there research in NZ to see if we have plants that will produce similar
                                                effect?

                                                Are what we wear contributing to the carbon emissions? This not
                                                only refers to what is used to make the fabric and clothes we wear

                                                but how we wear them. Is the uniform or workplace dress code such
                                                it is only possible to wear them during summer if the office is air
                                                conditioned?

                                                Why is insulation and even renewable energy (eg solar panels) not

                                                encouraged in new homes being built in NZ? A well insulated home
                                                not only means healthier people living in it but also less energy
                                                consumption required to heat the home in winter. Well planned
                                                homes will also ensure the insulated home is not too hot in the
                                                summer without requiring mechanical means of cooling.


                                                We have a lot of waste going into landfill when some of it can be
                                                redirected for reuse and/or to be recycled.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow           The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if                changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                           ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific

                                                understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years           yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be
in place at any given time. Do you agree        3 are in effect at all times.
with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to
to alter emissions budgets?                     “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.

                                                However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                                scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                                permitted.
Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should
considerations that the Government and take the following factors into consideration when advising on and

the Climate Commission will need to          setting budgets:
take into account when advising on and       • scientific knowledge regarding climate change

                                             • economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the
                                             economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the

                                             economy
                                             • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on
                                             taxation, public spending and public borrowing
                                             • social circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel
                                             poverty

                                             • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy
                                             supplies and
                                             the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require
Governments to set out plans within a        Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change
certain timeframe to achieve the             Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan.
emissions budgets?

Q10. What are the most important

issues for the Government to consider        The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
in setting plans to meet budgets? For        comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and
example, who do we need to work with,        reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that
the Climate Change Commission advises        Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.
                                             However, the Government should be legally required to consider and
on and monitors New Zealand's                formally respond to the Commission’s advice, and to provide an
progress towards its goals. Do you           explanation if they do not act on it.
agree with these functions?

Q12. What role do you think the Climate      The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in

relation to the New Zealand Emissions        the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to the
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?                     number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:

Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests
                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori

                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,
                                             insurance and local
                                             government
                                             • risk management
                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure

                                             • community engagement and communications.
                                             • business competitiveness
                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology
                                             development system.


                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

change?

Q15. The Government has proposed a           I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance
number of new functions to help us           is required in terms of how local councils are involved:
adapt to climate change. Do you agree        • a national climate change risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan

                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                             adaptation plan
                                             • an adaptation reporting power
Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation

reporting power that could see some         Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Further comments                            I would like to see more being done to reduce waste, recycle and/or
                                            reuse of items. It would be great if we can lead by example. There's
                                            already work done in NZ and overseas to improve on this.


                                            We need to ensure more is being done and perhaps government
                                            leads by example.
