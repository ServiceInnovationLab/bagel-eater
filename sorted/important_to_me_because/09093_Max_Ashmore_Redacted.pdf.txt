A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          A zero carbon act is important to me because I'm afraid that we
because...                                    haven't made any real progress, and we're rapidly running out of
                                              time. Ten years from now it'll be too late to change things, and I'll

                                              spend the next sixty years watching evacuations from Bangladesh.

Q1. What process should the                   The government should pass a law saying that. Look, honestly the
Government use to set a new emissions         standard process for passing laws seems pretty neat to be, I have a
reduction target in legislation?              crush on our legislative procedures.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             I think a target of net zero would be ideal. That seems quite doable,
target now, which is the best target for      and while it would certainly be costly, I think that's a price I'm willing
New Zealand?                                  to pay.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           A particularly aggressive carbon tax or ETS (like ours, but not
targets?                                      hilariously fake) would do it, and would be ideal. I prefer carbon

                                              taxes, since I think they're easier to remove loopholes from, but the
                                              two are of course exactly economically equivalent.

                                              I think more specific laws have their place, too. Targeting agriculture
                                              would be ideal, but I understand the political difficulties of this;

                                              increasing restrictions on imported cars' fuel efficiency would be
                                              great.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         You can't stop that happening! What sort of question is this? Unless
the 2050 target to be revised if              you're planning major constitutional change to entrench it, you have
circumstances change?                         no power to stop future governments (or, more specifically,
                                              legislatures) changing it as and when they please, which they

                                              absolutely will do over a thirty-two year time frame.

                                              I see no reason to encourage that by putting it in the bill. Let them
                                              change it by the standard amendment process when they want to.
                                              Which they will do.

Q5. The Government proposes that              Da, tovarishch!
three emissions budgets of five years

each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be More seriously, don't five year plans have unworkably awful
in place at any given time. Do you agree connotations? Do it in four or six, but I want you to win the next
with this proposal?                           election, so please don't make it easier for the "the government are
                                              a bunch of commies" crowd than you have to.


                                              In terms of bureaucuratic structure, I don't think it matters at all. Do
                                              what you have to do. But please don't make it look like you're
                                              cosplaying the soviet union.

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able They will. As I said above. This line of questioning is stupid, because
to alter emissions budgets?                   we have no power to entrench things.


                                              Ideally, I think they wouldn't except for compelling reasons - and I
                                              think if there's a compelling reason, they can amend the act when
                                              the issue arises.

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed
considerations that the Government and
the Climate Commission will need to           Looked 'em up, and they seem fine. Meaninglessly broad, of course,
                                              but what are you going to do?
take into account when advising on and
setting budgets?

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require       Yes, of course! Without a plan they'd be totally worthless, because
Governments to set out plans within a         everyone would put everything off until the last five minutes then
certain timeframe to achieve the
emissions budgets?                            amend the bill, like our friends in the UK have found.
Q10. What are the most important              I think they need to act, preferably yesterday. Literally everything
issues for the Government to consider         else is secondary to that consideration: a mediocre plan now is

in setting plans to meet budgets? For         better than a perfect plan in two years time. Please, please, don't
example, who do we need to work with,         hold up the process to consult with more people, no matter how
what else needs to be considered?             appealing they may sound. Just move.

Q11. The Government has proposed that
the Climate Change Commission advises In the abstract I'd like to empower them with decision making power
on and monitors New Zealand's                 to expedite decision making. In practice we're a small enough
progress towards its goals. Do you            country that it barely matters.

agree with these functions?

Q12. What role do you think the Climate       As above - in practice I think there's no need to empower them. But
Change Commission should have in              in theory, sure, I think they could control the number of units
relation to the New Zealand Emissions
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?                      available.

Q13. The Government has proposed that Obviously range of expertise is good, but I worry it's too capacious
Climate Change Commissioners need to          and will slow down decision making. Churchill's war cabinet had five

expertise. Do you agree with the              in human history, our small country shouldn't go above that to deal
proposed expertise?                           with climate change. More generally, I think decision-making bodies
                                              larger than that rapidly become ossified.


                                              I would reduce it right down to three or four people, and outsource
                                              things like expertise with Te Tiriti; obviously that's admirable and
                                              important, but should be available to the commissioners if they ask,
                                              not necessarily at the table. So too actually climate science isn't
                                              important for the commissioners: scientists are amazing and

                                              talented people, but their skill set is not the same as that necessary
                                              for swift decision. All the commissioners need to know is that climate
                                              change is real, serious, and mostly caused by greenhouse gases:
                                              anything further should be available on request.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill        No. That should be a separate bill, but I hate omnibus bills: you can
should cover adapting to climate              sign several bills, but putting them all together tends to leads to
change?                                       wires crossing and ineffective governance.

Q15. The Government has proposed a

number of new functions to help us            All seem okay.
adapt to climate change. Do you agree
with the proposed functions?

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation              The government can explore whatever it wants - that seems fine. But
reporting power that could see some           once again, what matters now is speed, not exploring programs
                                              which seem good at some point in the future. If this holds up actual

exposure to climate change risks?

Further comments                              This bill matters to me more than anything else this government has
                                              done or will do. Please act - you don't have many chances to do
                                              something that will actually change the world of your grandchildren,
                                              but this is one of them. Nobody will remember how you deal with the
                                              nurses' strike (not that that doesn't matter) or how you deal with

                                              immigration (again, not unimportant), but this will be your legacy in
                                              fifty years.

                                              For what it's worth, the day I think the Nats are more likely to act on
                                              climate change is the day you lose my vote - I'm sure that doesn't

                                              worry you, but still.
