A Zero Carbon Act is important to me         climate change is the biggest threat to the wellbeing of people
because...                                   across the world. This summer I visited Antarctica and heard from
                                             geoscientists that unless we act now, the Ross sea ice shelf is very

                                             likely to be destroyed in the near future, raising the sea level by
                                             huge amounts and causing devistation across the world. New
                                             Zealand needs to take responsibility and act to reduce our
                                             greenhouse gas emissions before we see the distatorours
                                             consequences of our actions.

Q1. What process should the

New Zealand?                                 targets like reduce gases which have a high impact on warming like

                                             abitrarily on the year 1990.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its          We need to take responsibility for emissions, not leave it up to

targets?                                     others, so we need to reduce our own emissions through increased
                                             forestry, changing farming methods, creating more sustainable
                                             transport and not by using international carbon credits.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow        Our economy can only thrive if our climate is healthy, so any

                                             change our targets is if our scientific understanding of climate
                                             change in the future suggests that we should.

with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able The greatest threat to our economy is changing weather patterns

to alter emissions budgets?                  due to climate change. This means we should set emissions budgets
                                             which keep our climate and economy safe, and then not change
                                             emissions budgets for economic reasons. The only reason to change
                                             emissions budgets is new scientific understanding.

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           The Government and the Climate Commission should take the

                                             workers, especially those vunerable such as farmers with large debt

                                             or people in precarious work.

                                             and that poor New Zealanders are not unfairly burdened.

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:

                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure

                                             • community engagement and communications.

                                             I do not think business competitiveness is an important expertise, as

                                             effective businesses have not shown ability to consider or regulate
                                             greenhouse gas emissions.

                                             As climate change is a huge public health issue, expertise in public
                                             health is also important.


                                             The age and gender distribution of the commission needs to also be
                                             considered, as young people and women are going to be most
