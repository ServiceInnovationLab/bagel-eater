A Zero Carbon Act is important to me           I want to see a concrete commitment to concerted action towards a
because...                                     zero carbon New Zealand. This is essential if we are to play our part
                                               in reducing the consequences of man-made global warming, which

                                               already threatens many lives world wide. In the long term, if we do
                                               not act quickly now, we will be contributing to the knowing
                                               destruction of the ecosystem that we currently know.
                                               We need this law to ensure that we stay on the right track and
                                               demonstrate to the rest of the world our commitment to an

                                               ambitious but realistic and achievable target for our country.
                                               I believe that all New Zealanders want the best for the future of our
                                               country and this is what this Act represents. We can and we must act
                                               now and anything less than commitment to a zero carbon future is
                                               totally irresponsible.

Q1. What process should the                    The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now. This

Government use to set a new emissions          will ensure accountability and provide clarity for policy makers, who

                                               sustainable use of resources.
                                               A cross-party consensus should be sought and the Climate
                                               Commission should be used to inform the details of the target set.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050              The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for       zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to

New Zealand?                                   ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                               we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                               short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its            By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                       forest planting).
                                               I believe we need to focus on New Zealand's transition to a just and

                                               sustainable zero carbon economy. Our transition must be
                                               comprehensive and will be most cost effective if we consider not only
                                               our emissions but all aspects of sustainability in our use of resources.
                                               If we purchase carbon credits from overseas, it should be to support
                                               the global climate mitigation effort not to replace action within New

                                               Zealand.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow          The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if               changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. There can be
circumstances change?                          flexibility in the ways in which different governments choose to meet
                                               the target, but they must remain accountable to achieving the zero
                                               carbon target.
                                               However, the ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major

                                               changes in scientific understanding or international agreements
                                               should be permitted, for example, if international targets became
                                               more ambitious.

Q5. The Government proposes that

with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to

                                               However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                               scientific understanding or international agreements should be

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.
