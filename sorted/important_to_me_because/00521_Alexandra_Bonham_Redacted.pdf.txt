A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          I want to minimise climate disruption that will be suffered by my
because...                                    children and I think we need to focus on the issues now rather than
                                              kicking this can (of worms) down the road. I believe it will also

                                              stimulate creativity, give some certainty to business and encourage
                                              those who are trying to do the right thing and feel they are
                                              swimming against the tide.

Q1. What process should the
Government use to set a new emissions         The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now with
reduction target in legislation?              lots of smaller targets along the way.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for      zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to

New Zealand?                                  ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                      forest planting). (Individual fossil fuel ration cards may be the fairest
                                              way to balance the onus on people, so there could be a tiny carbon

                                              marketplace as well as an international one and perhaps a certain
                                              amount of that could be sold by an individual to someone else). I also
                                              think there should be a campaign to encourage smaller families with
                                              perhaps tax breaks only available for the first two children (or births,
                                              in the case where the second birth produces multiple offspring). All

                                              unbuilt on land that is good for cultivation should be protected and
                                              not built upon and good soil maintained there as soil can suck up
                                              carbon well. This could be a great way to mitigate what carbon we do
                                              use.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the

                                              understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years         yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be
in place at any given time. Do you agree      3 are in effect at all times.

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to

                                              However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed            I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

the Climate Commission will need to           setting budgets:

                                              economy
                                              • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on

                                              the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require       Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change
Governments to set out plans within a
certain timeframe to achieve the              Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan. If there is
emissions budgets?                            uncertainty then we should err on the side of caution.

Q10. What are the most important              The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be

issues for the Government to consider         comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and
in setting plans to meet budgets? For         reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi. The government should
example, who do we need to work with,         engage with everyone, and there should be all hands on deck for MPs
what else needs to be considered?             to discuss and engage their constituencies on this subject to explain
                                              what needs to happen, and the options that are being worked

                                              through. It is very important to ensure that noone feels left behind. It
                                              would also be necessary if it may mean an economic recession to
                                              consider how home owners/ business owners/ everyone can get
                                              through negative equity, business/employment challenges and be
                                              able to contribute and feel safe. Ensuring home and food security will

                                              be key - this may have some ramifications internationally and it is
                                              important then for New Zealand to manage this situation so New
                                              Zealand can be identified as one of a group of leaders in this area,
                                              and not vulnerable.

Q11. The Government has proposed that

agree with these functions?

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:

Climate Change Commissioners need to          • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable       • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the              markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                           • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests
                                              • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori

                                              • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,

                                              • community engagement and communications.

                                              I think expertise in public health is also important.
Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill
should cover adapting to climate              Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within

                                              low. There does not need to be one highly complex blueprint for this.

                                              responsible for their packaging, and obsolete/broken products would
                                              be extremely helpful. The Auckland Unitary Plan consultation
                                              indicated that residents wanted a more compact city - this would
                                              also be a lower carbon city as there would be less car travel (and

                                              ran counter to local aims. More support from the government for
                                              cities and local communities to shape their own low carbon future
                                              would be really appreciated.
