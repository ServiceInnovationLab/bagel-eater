A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          Climate change represents the greatest existential threat to
because...                                    humanity and to a large proportion of the other species that we
                                              share the planet with. But it is also a threat that we have the

                                              innovative ability and capacity to deal with, though not through
                                              discredited laissez-faire market mechanisms. The Act is critical now
                                              because other attempts to respond to climate change have largely
                                              failed as our emissions climb. I am retired and am distressed that my
                                              generation, which has benefited materially from the unsustainable

                                              exploitation of Earth's resources, is poised to deliver a mess to our
                                              children and our mokopuna.

Q1. What process should the                   The Government should legislate now set a target for 2050 and the
Government use to set a new emissions

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             Net zero long-lived gases and stabilised short-lived gases: This
target now, which is the best target for      appears to provide the most practical means of reaching an effective

                                              stabilise agricultural emissions of methane and nitrous oxide.
                                              Agriculture cannot be excluded given NZ's profile of emissions.
                                              Emission of methane from fossil sources should be managed to net
                                              zero.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new

                                              destruction through other causes).

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target is far too important to be subject to the three-yearly
the 2050 target to be revised if              winds of policy-change that can accompany the electoral cycle.
circumstances change?                         Alteration in response to “economic changes” will seriously
                                              undermine its long-term certainty. However, the ability to strengthen
                                              or otherwise revise the 2050 target may be permitted in the light of

                                              major, independently validated, changes in scientific understanding
                                              or international agreements.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years         yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be
in place at any given time. Do you agree      3 are in effect at all times.

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able As with Q4, there may be circumstances where the emissions

                                              the milestones toward the 2050 target. New technologies or
                                              scientific understandings may also provide a basis for amendment of
                                              the budgets but those changes should be aimed at earlier or better
                                              achievement of the targets. The budgets should not be able to be

                                              altered to meet short-term political or the interests of particular
                                              interest-groups.
Q8. Do you agree with the proposed            I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

                                              resources generally, with particular reference to planetary

                                              boundaries. Climate change is a very serious challenge, but it is also
                                              a symptom of a wider issue of how we manage resources across the
                                              globe.

Q11. The Government has proposed that Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to          • climate change policy (including emissions trading)

have a range of essential and desirable       • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour

                                              I think expertise in public health is also important.
