A Zero Carbon Act is important to me        We need systemic change that shapes everyone's behaviour to be
because...                                  low-emissions. Let's fix the system before it's too late!

Q1. What process should the
Government use to set a new emissions       Set a target for 2050 in legislation right now. Use the Two Baskets
                                            approach.
reduction target in legislation?
Q2. If the Government sets a 2050           go hard! total greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050.

target now, which is the best target for
New Zealand?                                Smash those long-lived gases into negative, and get short-lived
                                            gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its         By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                    forest planting). Counting overseas stuff is a sad copout and destroys
                                            the point.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow
                                            Only insofar as there's major change in scientific understanding or
the 2050 target to be revised if            international agreements. Otherwise hell no.
circumstances change?

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be YEs, this will give people decent certainty and plannability.
in place at any given time. Do you agree
with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able no! Only as per q4. (and then only insofar as it makes climate sense

to alter emissions budgets?                 to do that).

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed
considerations that the Government and      Yes these make sense. But they should be considerations in *how*
the Climate Commission will need to
take into account when advising on and      we achieve the goals, not whether.

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require

Governments to set out plans within a       Yes! Without strict timeframes it's completely toothless.
certain timeframe to achieve the
emissions budgets?

Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider       Do whatever you need to so that the plans to meet emission budgets
in setting plans to meet budgets? For       are comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable,
example, who do we need to work with,       and reflect a proper commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.

what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.
the Climate Change Commission advises
on and monitors New Zealand's               But the Government of the day should be legally required to consider
progress towards its goals. Do you          meaningfully and formally respond to the Commission’s advice, and
agree with these functions?                 to provide an explanation if they choose not to act on it. We need

                                            "nah we decided not to" to be a painful and publicly judged choice.

Q12. What role do you think the Climate     It should advise the Government on policy settings in our ETS.

relation to the New Zealand Emissions       Don't have it making decisions itself about units available in the NZ
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?                    ETS, or implementation.
Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the list provided, but think it should explicitly include

have a range of essential and desirable      won't know enough about how best to shape people's choices. This is
expertise. Do you agree with the             crucial because these are collective issues shaped by aggregate
proposed expertise?                          individual choices. So public health outcomes, economic outcomes,
                                             community cohesion outcomes and environmental outcomes can all
                                             be served by this

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill
should cover adapting to climate             Hell yes.

Q15. The Government has proposed a           I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance

with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan
                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national

                                             • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
