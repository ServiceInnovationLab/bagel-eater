                                              everything we can do to curtail and ultimately pot a stop to this
                                              abuse.

Q1. What process should the                   The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now. The
Government use to set a new emissions         Government should set out a clear and accessible pathway so the
reduction target in legislation?              whole community can understand how that target will be achieved.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for      zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                  ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:

                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                      forest planting). By prioritising native over non-native afforestation.
                                              By massively upscaling wind and solar power generation, including
                                              by empowering/subsidising communities to buy, install and benefit

                                              from renewable power generation. By imposing tarifffs and
                                              ultimately bans on many plastic products (the community still does

                                              animal farmers. By supporting low-carbon land-use change, including

                                              for Māori landowners.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
