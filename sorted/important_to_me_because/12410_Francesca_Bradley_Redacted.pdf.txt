A Zero Carbon Act is important to me           We need a plan to reduce our emissions and prepare New
because...                                     Zealanders for the effects of climate change. We need meaningful
                                               action now that puts aside political appetites. This Act needs to stand

                                               the test of time because as a country we need binding legislation
                                               that will guarantee a viable livelihood for future generations. This is
                                               our largest social justice issue facing New Zealand and the world and
                                               we need to be ambitious in our leadership as a country.

Q1. What process should the                    The Government is required under the Paris Agreement to reach a
Government use to set a new emissions          target for 2050. Our Government should be more ambitious in this

reduction target in legislation?               target, aiming for net zero emissions by 2040 or earlier.

                                               In setting this target, Parliament needs to build cross-party
                                               consensus on the direction of New Zealand’s climate change
                                               response to lock an ambitious target into law. Setting a target in this

                                               way will promote political accountability, clarity, and long-term
                                               certainty for the future of New Zealanders.

                                               It is important advice is sought from the Climate Commission on
                                               setting this target, particularly on the definitions of stabilised and

                                               sustainable levels of short-lived greenhouse gases.
Q2. If the Government sets a 2050              I support the most ambitious, clearest, science-based target;

target now, which is the best target for       reducing all greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050 or sooner. It is
New Zealand?                                   important to take a science-based approach to ensure our emission
                                               reduction efforts are as impactful as possible. This means
                                               recognising the difference between long-lived greenhouse gases
                                               (such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide) and short-lived

                                               greenhouse gases (such as methane).

                                               I strongly hope the Government adopts Generation Zero's proposal
                                               of a “two baskets” approach. Applying a two baskets approach to
                                               achieve a net zero 2050 all gases target would mean: combining

                                               long-lived gas reductions with carbon sinks (through forestry and
                                               carbon sequestration in soil) to achieve negative long-lived
                                               emissions by 2050; and reducing short-lived gases to sustainable
                                               levels.


                                               A two baskets approach does not mean treating the agricultural
                                               sector differently from other sectors. Nitrous oxide, which is primarily
                                               emitted through agricultural practices, is a long-lived greenhouse
                                               gas. It must be reduced to net zero. The science is clear that
                                               methane emissions must also be reduced. However, it is not

                                               necessary to reduce methane to net zero to stop global warming.

                                               The most ambitious and impactful contribution New Zealand could
                                               make to to keep global warming well below 2C, striving to 1.5C is
                                               finding ways to absorb more of the existing long-lived gases from the

                                               atmosphere than the amount we are emitting.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its            New Zealand should meet its targets by only using domestic
targets?                                       emissions reductions (including from new forest planting). New
                                               Zealand cannot rely on international carbon credits, as this creates
                                               uncertainty about what reductions need to be achieved in New
                                               Zealand. It also means as a country, we are investing in other

                                               countries’ low emission transitions, rather than our own.
Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow          The 2050 target should not be revised in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if               changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty and in effect

circumstances change?                          create more economic instability. Setting clear, legally-binding
                                               emission reduction targets will provide accountability and certainty.
                                               This approach will retain flexibility by permitting different
                                               governments to use different policies to meet these targets, in
                                               response to changing circumstances and new technology.


                                               However, the ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major
                                               changes in scientific understanding or international law and
                                               agreements (such as the Paris Agreement becoming more ambitious)
                                               should be permitted. Any revision should require input from the

                                               Climate Commission and approval by Parliament.
Q5. The Government proposes that

each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be These legally-binding budgets must be set at a level recommended
in place at any given time. Do you agree by the Climate Commission and approved by Parliament.
with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able Q6: No. It is not appropriate for a new government to alter the last
to alter emissions budgets?                    set emissions budget as this undermines the long-term certainty and

                                               stability they provide. A new government should be able to introduce
                                               different policies to meet the upcoming target. Only in exceptional
                                               circumstances, such as major changes in scientific understanding or
                                               international agreements, should the ability to revise budgets be
                                               permitted.


                                               Q7: As explained above, only under a specific range of exceptional
                                               circumstances should the Government be allowed to review and
                                               adjust the second emissions budget. After an extreme natural
                                               disaster it may be deemed appropriate to change an upcoming

                                               budget. Revision of a budget can not result in changing the long-
                                               term 2050 target.

                                               months after an emission budget has been set.

Q10. What are the most important

example, who do we need to work with,          reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
what else needs to be considered?
Q11. The Government has proposed that Yes, I strongly support the Climate Commission having two functions:
the Climate Change Commission advises 1. providing expert advice

on and monitors New Zealand's                 2. monitoring our progress and holding the government to account.
progress towards its goals. Do you
agree with these functions?                   Transitioning to a zero carbon economy will require comprehensive
                                              and coordinated policies across all sectors of the economy.
                                              Delegating some decision-making powers to the Commission (such

                                              as ETS settings) risks these policies being made without properly
                                              coordinating with policies elsewhere.

                                              A Commission with decision-making powers will also be a less
                                              effective watchdog. It would have a conflict of interest in holding

                                              itself to account over its own policy decisions.

                                              Similarly, the government should not be able to pass responsibility of
                                              making difficult decisions to the Commission. The Commission should
                                              provide expert advice, but it is the government that must take

                                              responsibility. The Government should be legally required to
                                              consider and formally respond to the Commission’s advice, and to
                                              provide an explanation if they do not act on it.

Q12. What role do you think the Climate       The Commission should only advise the Government on policy
Change Commission should have in              settings in the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with
relation to the New Zealand Emissions         respect to the number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?                      implementation. As mentioned above, delegating this decision-

                                              making to the Commission risks this policy being made without
                                              properly coordinating with policies elsewhere.

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree the Commissioners should hold the following collective
Climate Change Commissioners need to          expertise:

                                              development system.


                                              If adaptation is included in the Act, it will be important to think
                                              carefully about how many Commissioners should have adaptation-
                                              specific expertise. Expertise is in this area should include public
                                              health and experience with addressing adaptation challenges like
                                              planning, insurance and local government.
