A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          Our world is already showing the stresses upon the environment,
because...                                    flora and fauna from changes to our climate. There are risks here on
                                              many levels:

                                              I don't want to be part of the generation that triggered the next mass
                                              extinction.
                                              I see the effects on our national infrastructure and economy caused
                                              by changes in weather patterns. There is a major financial hit coming
                                              at a national, regional and local level which will only get worse if we

                                              don't take steps now... the later we leave things the more drastic the
                                              efforts we will have to make and the more it will cost us.
                                              If we look at the chaos in the world caused by mass migration it will
                                              be nothing compared to that caused by future climate shifts. Reports
                                              by both the Pentagon and CIA, available to the public, express in

                                              clear terms the major risks to world peace from climate conflict. We
                                              have our part to pay in this.

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important. By encouraging

                                             pollution, and this will have a positive impact on health budgets. This
                                             will need engagement with city planning, transport and health

Further comments                               Every effort must be made to reduce the use of fossil fuels within our
                                               infrastructure. This included building national capacity for generation
                                               through geothermal, tidal, wind and solar sources.


                                               Houses should be encouraged through grants and loans to be as self-
                                               sufficient as possible by encouraging the use of domestic solar
                                               panels for energy generation, batteries for storage and better
                                               insulation, particularly through improved glazing.


                                               It is critical to win hearts and minds to move drivers from internal
                                               combustion-engined vehicles to electric ones. This means targeting
                                               benefits specific to different audiences.


                                               Most critical at this moment and in the future is to continue to invest
                                               in charging stations across the country (for long distance driving and
                                               tourism), and within large cities for local use. A lot of people could
                                               use the Gen 1 and Gen 2 Nissan Leaf for local and commuter
                                               purposes but they need to know they can get these shorter-range

                                               vehicles charged. Electric vehicles are expensive to buy so there has
                                               to be a running cost benefit through expansion of subsidized
                                               charging stations and holding back of road user taxes for EVs.

                                               facilities such as arenas and pavilions and in civic car parks should

                                               be a priority.
