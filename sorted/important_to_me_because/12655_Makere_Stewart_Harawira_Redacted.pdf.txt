                                              changes that the world is experiencing are happening at a

                                              reducing our carbo emissions as a country.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for      zero by 2050. I support taking a science-based approach to ensure

New Zealand?                                  our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible: we
                                              should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels. That includes drastically
                                              reducing emissions caused by agriculture, by coal and oil mining and
                                              by vehicles.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new

targets?                                      forest planting), but most emphatically NOT by the application of
                                              sleight-of-hand carbo credit systems.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                         ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                              understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that

                                              yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that

with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No, absolutely not. Emissions budgets should not be altered in

                                              certainty as well as enabling them to be used for political leverage.

                                              However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                              scientific understanding or international agreements should be

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q16. Should the Government explore

setting up a targeted adaptation
