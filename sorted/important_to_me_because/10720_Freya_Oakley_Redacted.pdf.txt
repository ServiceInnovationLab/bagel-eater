A Zero Carbon Act is important to me         The release of carbon-bearing gases into the atmosphere is the most

                                             that this can be controlled is by the cessation of mining fossil carbon.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050            The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net

                                             we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                             short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its          By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new

                                             which we can guarantee to control the mining of fossil carbon). It is
                                             feasible to capture carbon released from the burning of trees, by the
                                             planting of more trees; it is probably not feasible to capture the

                                             carbon released by the burning of fossil carbon by the planting of
                                             trees, because of the quantities involved.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow        The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic

                                             more important than these.

Q11. The Government has proposed that
the Climate Change Commission advises        Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.

Q12. What role do you think the Climate      Emissions Trading Schemes are just ways of parasites making money

                                             defrauded is perhaps another consideration.

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests

                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,
                                             insurance and local
                                             government
                                             • risk management

                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                             • community engagement and communications.
                                             • business competitiveness
                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill       No. Adaptation to climate change is a separate issue, and if included

Further comments                             Agricultural emissions, apart from the burning of fossil fuels, are

                                             emissions of carbon fixed on an ultra-short-term cycle. Animal
                                             carbon emissions are of carbon that was fixed by agricultural
                                             processes within the previous twelve months. They are therefore
                                             irrelevant to climate change, apart from the fact that in some cases
                                             long-enduring carbon dioxide has been exchanged into short-

                                             enduring methane. Agricultural emissions, apart from the use of
                                             fossil fuels, must be left out of the equation. On the other hand, the
                                             carbon fixed on farms by trees must be given equal credit with the
                                             carbon fixed by trees off farms.
