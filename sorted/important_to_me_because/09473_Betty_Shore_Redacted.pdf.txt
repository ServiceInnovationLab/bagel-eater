A Zero Carbon Act is important to me         Whatever "reasons" are given to delay our response to climate
because...                                   change are beside the point. The damage is already happening and it
                                             is caused by our actions and inactions. We need safe places to live,

                                             nutritious food, dependable homes, and these are already being
                                             destroyed by climate change. The choices we make will impact for
                                             good or for ill. We need to choose wisely now for ourselves and for
                                             the future. ,

Q1. What process should the                  The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now. This
Government use to set a new emissions        must be in legislation that is enforceable, not just in aspirations

reduction target in legislation?             without action to bring them about.
Q2. If the Government sets a 2050            The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net

target now, which is the best target for     zero by 2050. Our targets must be science based in order to ensure
New Zealand?                                 they are as effective as possible. We must reach negative levels of
                                             long-lived gases, and reduce short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its
targets?                                     We must meet targets by reducing domestic emissions.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow        The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if             changes” because this would undermine long-term certainty. We

circumstances change?                        have to change the economy. Climate change won't be swayed by
                                             economic arguments.
                                             If major changes in scientific information or international agreements
                                             suggest need for revising targets, this should be considered and
                                             permitted, but that includes tightening the targets if necessary.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years        Yes - 5-year budgets must be set 10-15 years in advance, so that 3

each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be are in effect at all times. This is essential for the planning that needs
in place at any given time. Do you agree to be done in order to implement the budgets.
with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No. As above, emissions budgets should not be altered in response
to alter emissions budgets?                  to “economic changes” because this destroys the long-term certainty
                                             for which they were set up.

                                             Revising budgets in light of major changes in scientific understanding
                                             or international agreements should be permitted, but this could also
                                             mean tightening them.
Q8. Do you agree with the proposed            I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should
considerations that the Government and take the following factors into consideration when advising on and

the Climate Commission will need to           setting budgets:
take into account when advising on and
setting budgets?                              The real questions are 1)What do we need to cut back ? 2) How fast
                                              can we actually do that, given the urgency needed?
                                              Given those questions, we should address them with --

                                              *The full scientific knowledge available
                                              *The full technology available for how to move in reducing.
                                              *Recognition that our economy will have to change. Our current
                                              economic goals and systems have been a contributing factor in
                                              bringing us to this crisis. We will have to change our economic goals

                                              and means in order to use resources sustainably to provide access to
                                              food, housing, health, education, livelihoods, recreation for all our
                                              people.
                                              *Fairness in sharing the costs. Our systems have given privilege to
                                              some and burdons to others. The reality is that there will be costs to

                                              sustainability, and that access to resources has benefited some
                                              people at cost to others. The reality is that we are guardians of
                                              resources that are not the property of anyone to do as they please.
                                              Living honestly in that reality will be costly to some people, but it is
                                              the only way to survival for our people.
                                              * Honour for Te Tiriti o Waitangi. The principles are consistent with

                                              guardianship of resources.

Q10. What are the most important              The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be

what else needs to be considered?             unions, business, old, young, ALL of us.

Q11. The Government has proposed that
the Climate Change Commission advises
on and monitors New Zealand's                 Yes - the Commission should advise and monitor. Elected

agree with these functions?

Q12. What role do you think the Climate       The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in

relation to the New Zealand Emissions
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?                      Decisions rest with elected representatives

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to          • climate change policy (including emissions trading)

have a range of essential and desirable       • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the              markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                           • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests
                                              • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
                                              • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,

                                              insurance and local
                                              government
                                              • risk management
                                              • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                              • community engagement and communications.

                                              • business competitiveness
                                              • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology
                                              development system.

                                              I think expertise in public health is also important.
Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill       Yes. Definitely. Change is already happening and we need to prepare
should cover adapting to climate             for more. These people as above, have experience to offer. It's all

change?                                      related and needs to be connected.
Q15. The Government has proposed a           I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance

number of new functions to help us           is required in terms of how local councils are involved:
adapt to climate change. Do you agree        • a national climate change risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                 • a national adaptation plan
                                             • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                             adaptation plan

                                             • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation
reporting power that could see some          Yes. We really need to work together from whole range of positions.
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
