A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          The near-total inaction of NZ governments clearly shows that action
because...                                    on climate change needs can no longer be a fair-weather political
                                              choice. A Zero Carbon Act gives all future governments a mandate to

                                              act on emissions reduction and the essential transition to a zero-
                                              carbon economy.
                                              My own experience of NZ communities is that there is a wealth of
                                              knowledge, action and commitment to transitioning to a zero carbon
                                              economy at the grass roots level, but what has been missing until

                                              now is leadership and action from government and the farming
                                              sector. A Zero Carbon Act is the mechanism to change this.

Q1. What process should the
Government use to set a new emissions         The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now.
reduction target in legislation?

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for      zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                  ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:

                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels. Methane must be included as
                                              well as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. I also support taking a
                                              science-based approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions
                                              are as impactful as possible: we should aim for negative levels of

                                              long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable
                                              levels. The emissions from transport, industrial activity, agriculture,
                                              and all other sources should be included in the target. Even ‘short-
                                              lived’ gasses can have a huge effect on our climate and need to be
                                              reduced. I support a 1.5°C net

                                              zero emissions target for 2040. This is because in terms of global
                                              urgency, the health gains from equitable mitigation, and especially
                                              fairness, the current target needs to be more ambitious, before
                                              2040.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                      forest planting).

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic

the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                         ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                              understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be     yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that

with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to

                                              However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                              scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                              permitted.
Q8. Do you agree with the proposed            I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

the Climate Commission will need to           setting budgets:
take into account when advising on and        • scientific knowledge regarding climate change
setting budgets?                              • technology relevant to climate change
                                              • economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the
                                              economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the

                                              economy
                                              • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on
                                              taxation, public spending and public borrowing
                                              • social circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel
                                              poverty

                                              • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy
                                              supplies and
                                              the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require
Governments to set out plans within a         Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change
certain timeframe to achieve the              Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan.
emissions budgets?

Q10. What are the most important

issues for the Government to consider         The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
in setting plans to meet budgets? For         comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and
example, who do we need to work with,         reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body. But also
the Climate Change Commission advises the Commission must set NZ’s Emissions Budgets – like the Reserve

on and monitors New Zealand's                 Bank independently sets NZ’s Official Cash Rate. The Commission
progress towards its goals. Do you            can also advise how NZ stays within these budgets, how NZ can best
agree with these functions?                   adapt to climate change, and monitor progress on NZ’s emissions
                                              reductions. The Government should be legally required to consider
                                              and formally respond to the Commission’s advice, and to provide an

                                              explanation if they do not act on it. It is also crucial that the
                                              Commission's advice is transparent. Just like the UK Climate
                                              Commission, the NZ Commission's advice should be released to all
                                              NZers, media and the government at the same time. The
                                              Government should not receive nor get advice on Emissions Budgets
                                              in advance of their public release. This will allow NZers to also hold

                                              government to account, and prevent governments from interfering
                                              or otherwise unduly influencing the Commission's independent and
                                              official advice.

Q12. What role do you think the Climate
Change Commission should have in              The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in
relation to the New Zealand Emissions         the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to the
                                              number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to          • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable       • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the              markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                           • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests

                                              • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
                                              • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,
                                              insurance and local
                                              government
                                              • risk management

                                              • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                              • community engagement and communications.
                                              • business competitiveness
                                              • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology
                                              development system.


                                              I think expertise in public health is also important.
Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill      No. This would distract from the central purpose of the Climate
should cover adapting to climate            Commission. Adaptation could be worked on by other agencies while

change?                                     the Commission focuses on the carbon budget.
Q15. The Government has proposed a          I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance

number of new functions to help us          is required in terms of how local councils are involved:
adapt to climate change. Do you agree       • a national climate change risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                • a national adaptation plan
                                            • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                            adaptation plan

                                            • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation
reporting power that could see some         Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
