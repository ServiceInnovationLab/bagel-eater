A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          I am deeply concerned about the destruction of our natural capital:
because...                                    climate, biodiversity and ecosystem services. New Zealand's per
                                              capita emissions are extreme and I'm ashamed of this.

Q1. What process should the                   The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now. That

Government use to set a new emissions         target must be clearly and unambiguously consistent with meeting
reduction target in legislation?              our Paris commitments.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for      zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                  ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions, planting and natural

targets?                                      regeneration of native vegetation, exotic forestry plantation in
                                              locations where there is no risk to remaining native biodiversity and
                                              minimal risk of fire. Avoid inland South Island because fire risk is
                                              already high and will only get worse, wilding spread is problematic
                                              and causes native biodiversity loss.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to economic

the 2050 target to be revised if              considerations or sectoral business impacts as this undermines its
circumstances change?                         long-term certainty. However, the 2050 target should be revisable in
                                              light of new scientific understanding or international agreements.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be     yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No! Emissions budgets should not be altered in response to

                                              undermines the long-term certainty of budgets. However, the ability
                                              to revise budgets in response to new scientific understanding or
                                              international agreements should be permitted if supported by the

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed            I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

Q11. The Government has proposed that        Yes. The Commission should not be a decision-making body.

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.

organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Further comments                             There needs to be an overarching requirement for decision makers
                                             to have particular regard to GHG emissions and carbon sequestration
                                             under all other legislation but most especially land and transport
                                             management legislation (Land Act, Conservation, Resource
                                             Management, Forestry, Transport). The purpose of this overarching

                                             legislation is minimise perverse impacts of legislation that did not
                                             contemplate the need to reduce net GHG emissions to zero.
