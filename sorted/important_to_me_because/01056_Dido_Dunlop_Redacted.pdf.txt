A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          I think of nothing else but the climate emergency. I believe we may
because...                                    already be too late to prevent effects such as sea level rise of 20 - 70
                                              metres, food supplies becoming unreliable, refugees from the pacific

                                              and Asia, and many other things. we need to act as quickly as
                                              possible. any delay will also be massively expensive. I believe we
                                              should declare a state of emergency, such as America did in the
                                              second world war, and pull together all our resources very fast.

Q1. What process should the                   The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now.
Government use to set a new emissions         I think we will later need to adjust our target to act faster than this,

reduction target in legislation?              this is a good start.
Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net

target now, which is the best target for      zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                  ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                              we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                              short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                      forest planting).


                                              as to methane from cows and sheep - i don't like the idea of injecting
                                              cows with something. that means whatever that is will be in the milk
                                              and meat. we should use farming methods of the sort used in
                                              Permaculture methods; that would regenerate pasture, slow erosion,

                                              provide healthier feed and help clear waterways. it would help
                                              methane emissions from the animals too. also feeding them seaweed
                                              seems to be a good solution.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                         ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific

                                              understanding or international agreements should be permitted.
                                              the new information I hear very often says climate effects are
                                              happening 'faster than expected.' so I would like us to be prepared to
                                              speed up our processes in response to information like that.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be     yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
                                              3 are in effect at all times.

with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to
to alter emissions budgets?                   “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.
                                              However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                              scientific understanding or international agreements should be

                                              permitted.
Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

the Climate Commission will need to          setting budgets:

                                             economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the

                                             economy

                                             we also need to bear in mind that delays will only make dealing with
                                             climate change more expensive, so when we consider economic

                                             impacts we should look act the long term consequences of our
                                             decisions as well as short term effects. for example taxes and costs
                                             that look high in the short term will look mild later on.

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to          • climate change policy (including emissions trading)

have a range of essential and desirable       • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour

                                              I think expertise in public health is also important.


                                              one area not covered enough is the psychological and social effects
                                              of climate change. we will be dealing with high levels of emotional

                                              come with stress. we need people with expertise in this area too.

change?
                                              I think adaptation plans need to take a long term view rather than
                                              short term. e.g. building sea walls is a temporary measure. a longer
                                              term approach would be to start moving homes and infrastructure to
                                              higher ground away from the coast - in good time so everyone can

                                              make the adjustments slowly and thoroughly. also to move toward
                                              producing our food supplies in nz rather than relying on importing
                                              food.

                                              we should also do long term planning for water shortages, involving

                                              infrastructure and local communities.

Q15. The Government has proposed a            I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance
number of new functions to help us            is required in terms of how local councils are involved:
adapt to climate change. Do you agree         • a national climate change risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                  • a national adaptation plan
                                              • regular review of progress towards implementing the national

                                              adaptation plan
                                              • an adaptation reporting power

                                              I'd like to see local councils and govt working together.

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation
reporting power that could see some           Yes

organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Further comments                              I think informing the public about climate change and effects should
                                              be done right now as a priority. people are generally not aware of
                                              much of that. if we know what's coming, we can prepare, mentally
                                              and emotionally, as well as things like getting a water tank.

                                              otherwise people will be in shock when something unexpected
                                              happens, and find things much harder to deal with.

                                              I'm proud and delighted that nz is acting on this. I hope we inspire
                                              the rest of the world to act too.
