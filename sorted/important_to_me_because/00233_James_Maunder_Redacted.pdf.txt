A Zero Carbon Act is important to me         I believe that climate disruption due to human activity is the biggest
because...                                   threat to biodiversity and human welfare. We need this law to make
                                             future governments accountable for reducing New Zealand's climate

                                             impact, and to ensure that short-term political thinking doesn't
                                             compromise our course of action.

Q1. What process should the
Government use to set a new emissions        The Government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now.
reduction target in legislation?

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050            The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net
target now, which is the best target for     zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
New Zealand?                                 ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:

                                             we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                             short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its          By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                     forest planting).
                                             Also, I believe we should devise and implement a method to account
                                             for the emissions associated with imported products, and ensure that

                                             this otherwise externalised cost accrues to those products when sold
                                             in the New Zealand market. That way local manufacturers with low
                                             carbon business models can compete fairly with imported products
                                             from countries that operate without a price on carbon.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow        The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if             changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the

                                             understanding should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years        Yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be
in place at any given time. Do you agree     3 are in effect at all times.

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to

                                             However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                             scientific understanding should be permitted.

Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should

 Q10. What are the most important

 Q11. The Government has proposed that
 the Climate Change Commission advises Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body. The

 Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
 Climate Change Commissioners need to         - climate science

                                              I think the predominant expertise of commissioners should be
                                              scientific (75%), followed by legal and public policy (25%) and

 Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill

 exposure to climate change risks?

 Further comments                             As already stated in response to Q3 above, I believe we should
                                              devise and implement a method to account for the emissions
                                              associated with imported products, and ensure that this otherwise
                                              externalised cost accrues to those products when sold in the New
                                              Zealand market. That way local manufacturers with low carbon

                                              business models can compete fairly with imported products from
                                              countries that operate without a price on carbon.
