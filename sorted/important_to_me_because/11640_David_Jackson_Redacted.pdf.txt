A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          Because we need to get a consensus frameworks built into law so
because...                                    that we have a target that is durable and survives NZ's 3 yearly
                                              election cycle. This will give confidence to the public, a consistent

                                              framework for industry and sectors to plan and invest within
                                              (including the stability to make economic decisions and investments
                                              with will adapt to climate change and benefit the environment. I
                                              have witnessed climate change research, policy and politics since it
                                              first became an issue, and I am concerned at how little tangible

                                              progress we have made as a country. Indeed, while all the talk has
                                              happened, we have gone backwards and our emissions have
                                              continued to increase. The more we have delayed, the harder it is to
                                              meet the necessary targets e.g. Paris Accord or better. We have to
                                              put aside political differences and ideology, and make REAL progress

                                              with this Act.

Q1. What process should the                   We don't need a process. Sounds like an excuse to do more talking
Government use to set a new emissions         and defer real action. The Parliament needs to set a target now in
reduction target in legislation?              the Act.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             I like the middle target. Net carbon by 2050 (long-lived gases), and
target now, which is the best target for      stabilizing shorter lived greenhouse gases BUT WITH A TARGET
New Zealand?                                  SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW CURRENT LEVELS. I appreciate it is more
                                              difficult to address agricultural and other similar emissions, but that

                                              sector needs to seriously do their bit, and not be allowed to resist
                                              and undermine as they did with initiatives in the early 2000s (fart tax
                                              and other emotive response). Therefore need targets in the
                                              legislation for other gases, but not zero. . I

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           Forcusing on reducing our own NZ emissions. I am strongly against
targets?                                      use of overseas offsets. These are highly dubious, and often cannot

                                              be validated. New NZ plantings are OK (if the issue of permanence or
                                              replacement is addressed for plantations), as is increased carbon
                                              capture in native forests with improved growth from pest control or
                                              regeneration.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         As I said earlier, it is important the 2050 target is strongly
the 2050 target to be revised if              embedded. If it can be easily changed, then no one will by into it.

circumstances change?                         That will affect not just us normal citizens, but also business who
                                              need a reliable framework for them to make the necessary
                                              investment decisions in order to adapt and address greenhouse
                                              gases reductions and other changes. The only reason change might
                                              be reasonable is if the science changes e.g. new IPCC forecasts, but
                                              not on an economic whim or change in political philosophy.

Q5. The Government proposes that

three emissions budgets of five years         yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be     3 are in effect at all times.

                                             economy
                                             • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on

                                             hope of getting reductions earlier enough to meet the Paris targets
                                             and the 2050 target in the new Act. The later the planning and
                                             journey starts, the steeper the hill.

                                             to delay or obfuscate.

Q11. The Government has proposed that
the Climate Change Commission advises        Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.
                                             However, the Government should be legally required to consider and

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:

Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour
expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.
Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill

Q15. The Government has proposed a            I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance
number of new functions to help us            is required in terms of how local councils are involved:

adapt to climate change. Do you agree         • a national climate change risk assessment
with the proposed functions?                  • a national adaptation plan
                                              • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                              adaptation plan
                                              • an adaptation reporting power

                                              I think there also needs to be more effort at a national level to work
                                              with local and regional governments on adapting to climate change.
                                              As well as producing national guidance, that would involve working
                                              alongside councils to help implement it, as well as monitoring how
                                              they are adapting. Perhaps a climate change response requirement

                                              could be put into the Local Government Act, which would then have
                                              to be reflected in council's asset management plans for
                                              infrastructure and other services e.g. to explicitly think about how at-
                                              risk assets will need replacing (such as sewage plants which tend to
                                              be at a low point for gravity feed, which for coastal towns and cities

                                              can mean they are at risk from coastal inundation and seal level rise.


Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation
reporting power that could see some           Yes. Absolutely
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
