A Zero Carbon Act is important to me          The key to success in most things is to set realistic goals then go
because...                                    hell-for-leather to achieve them. We need to go hell-for-leather as
                                              atmospheric carbon is not going to wait for us. So let us set a

                                              schedule for how we are going to catch up with the damage that is
                                              happening.

Q1. What process should the                   The government should set a target for 2050 in legislation now with,
Government use to set a new emissions
reduction target in legislation?              probably 5-year targets leading to the desired 2050 result.

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050             I would like us to commit to the most ambitious target: reducing total
target now, which is the best target for      greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050.
New Zealand?

                                              We need to take a science-based approach to ensure our efforts to
                                              reduce emissions are as impactful as possible as soon as possible:
                                              we should aim for decreasing levels of long-lived gases, while
                                              reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels with the intention of
                                              eventually putting them into negative growth territory. Once upon a

                                              time nobody used urea much on farms - we had a clover and rye
                                              grass system going. So maybe we need to decrease our farming
                                              intensity with some way of easing farmers into that territory.

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its           I would like us to us to generate all of our greenhouse gas reductions
targets?                                      domestically. That would mean a fairly rapid transition into
                                              sustainable transport fuel (totally electric eventually) and reduce still

                                              further our electrical generation dependency on gas. We probably
                                              can't do away with it totally as the peak load has to be met
                                              somehow. For the rest, let's have solar farms and more wind
                                              farms. Some incentives to encourage domestic rooftop generation
                                              with onsite storage would get me across the start line on that. I am

                                              close.

                                              And, of course, plant as many trees as possible as soon as possible
                                              have regard to what is appropriate in any planting area. No totally
                                              radiata, please!!

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow         The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic

the 2050 target to be revised if              changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                         ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                              understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be Yes!
in place at any given time. Do you agree

with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to

                                              However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                              scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                              permitted.
Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should
considerations that the Government and take the following factors into consideration when advising on and

the Climate Commission will need to          setting budgets:
take into account when advising on and       • scientific knowledge regarding climate change
setting budgets?                             • technology relevant to climate change
                                             • economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the
                                             economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the

                                             economy
                                             • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on
                                             taxation, public spending and public borrowing
                                             • social circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel
                                             poverty

                                             • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy
                                             supplies and
                                             the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.

Q9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require      Yes. Without deadlines nothing much happens. Wriggling out
Governments to set out plans within a
certain timeframe to achieve the             becomes too easy because of short-lived fluctuations in the
emissions budgets?                           economy.

Q10. What are the most important

issues for the Government to consider        The government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
in setting plans to meet budgets? For        comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and
example, who do we need to work with,        reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
what else needs to be considered?

Q11. The Government has proposed that
the Climate Change Commission advises
                                             Yes. That is the most minimal set of functions the Commission should
on and monitors New Zealand's                have.
progress towards its goals. Do you
agree with these functions?

Q12. What role do you think the Climate      My first reaction is that the Climate Commission should be advisory
Change Commission should have in             because policy should be set by those elected to do so. However the
relation to the New Zealand Emissions        Overseas Investment Commission provides another model which it
Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?                     seems to me works quite well. The decisions of the Climate

                                             Commission would be less susceptible to political interference than
                                             those made by the Ministry of Energy (or whatever government
                                             department would be involved). So I am conflicted but leaning
                                             towards making the Climate Commission a decision-making body.


                                             As an aside I have always believed that a carbon tax was superior to
                                             an ETS. Create a market and all the get-rich-quick folk will be in it
                                             like a pack for hungry dogs.

Q13. The Government has proposed that I agree with the following collective expertise:
Climate Change Commissioners need to         • climate change policy (including emissions trading)
have a range of essential and desirable      • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour

expertise. Do you agree with the             markets and distribution)
proposed expertise?                          • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests
                                             • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
                                             • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning,
                                             insurance and local

                                             government
                                             • risk management
                                             • engineering and/or infrastructure
                                             • community engagement and communications. This is really
                                             important as all citizens must know what is going on.

                                             • business competitiveness
                                             • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology
                                             development system.

                                             I think expertise in public health is also important.
Q14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill      Yes, unless there is a companion bill setting up an Adaptation
should cover adapting to climate            Commission. We will have to make a lot of adaptations and they

change?                                     must be anticipated and planned for.
Q15. The Government has proposed a          I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance

number of new functions to help us          is required in terms of how local councils are involved:

with the proposed functions?                • a national adaptation plan
                                            • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
                                            adaptation plan

                                            • an adaptation reporting power

Q16. Should the Government explore
setting up a targeted adaptation
reporting power that could see some         Yes
organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
