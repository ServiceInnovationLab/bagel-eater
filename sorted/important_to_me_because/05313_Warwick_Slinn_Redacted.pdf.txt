A Zero Carbon Act is important to me           Climate change is a threat to the existence and quality of organic life
because...                                     as we know it. Living generations have a responsibility to ensure the
                                               future and well-being of following generations: so it is time to

                                               recognise that processes (the exploitation of carbon resources and,
                                               particularly in New Zealand, the uncontrolled effluent and gases
                                               released by agricultural production) which were initially designed to

                                               economic survival.

Q1. What process should the

reduction target in legislation?

Q2. If the Government sets a 2050              The most ambitious target: net zero emissions. We should reduce the
target now, which is the best target for       level of all greenhouse gases, including methane. I understand that
New Zealand?                                   to mean taking a scientific approach to different gases, not
                                               exempting the agricultural sector (a serious problem for New
                                               Zealand), removing all long-lived gas production, and reducing short-

                                               lived gases to sustainable levels (where I assume sustainability
                                               would be considered in relation to required levels of agricultural
                                               production for domestic purposes and an acceptable level of external
                                               trade).

Q3. How should New Zealand meet its            By using domestic emissions reductions only (including from new
targets?                                       forest planting). This approach would avoid the uncertainty about

                                               local targets created by using international credits.

Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow          The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic
the 2050 target to be revised if               changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
circumstances change?                          ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific
                                               understanding or international agreements should be permitted.
                                               Local catastrophic events causing social and economic upheaval

                                               aims, but should not need to affect the overall target.

Q5. The Government proposes that
three emissions budgets of five years          Yes: I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that
each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be
in place at any given time. Do you agree       3 are in effect at all times.
with this proposal?

Q6 - Q7. Should the Government be able Emissions budgets should not be altered simply in response to

                                               However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in
                                               scientific understanding or international agreements should be
                                               permitted, and governments need the flexibility to propose
                                               alternative means of achieving set targets, particularly if

                                               catastrophic or exceptional local events promote altered timetables
                                               or changed methods.
Q8. Do you agree with the proposed           Yes: I agree with considering the following factors when advising on
considerations that the Government and and setting budgets:

                                             economy

Q10. What are the most important
issues for the Government to consider        The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be
in setting plans to meet budgets? For        comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and

Q11. The Government has proposed that Yes: the Commission should not be a decision-making body. The

Further comments                             This whole enterprise will involve a highly complex set of
                                             interrelating principles, responsibilities and consequences. So far the
                                             efforts and proposals of the MfE offer hope and confidence for its

                                             success.
