Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

GC Limited (Mike Gwyther)








Reference no: 14

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 We need to force the dairy industry to start innovating. When it comes to greenhouse gases, methane is far more potent than
 anything that comes out of a tailpipe. Innovation from dairy now could save thousands of jobs later when we are faced with the twin
 economic threat of synthesised milk and meat coming from overseas producers. We should be working towards creating our own

 synthetics right now, not lagging behind. And big dairy should be leading the charge.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes
 No dodgy trades with 3rd/2nd world countries that can't be checked up on though!



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Of course, but only in terms of reducing emissions, not raising them.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes
 And also, again, only in terms of increasing funding if needed, not reducing it.




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 And also, again, only in terms of increasing funding if needed, not reducing it.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Dairy need to be brought on the journey. Transport agencies / ministries need to be part of the solution. The car industry needs to be
consulted and led.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Yes, but also experts from the tech sector with a keen understanding of newly emerging green technologies (eg Hyperloop, electric

planes, battery tech, home generation and micro-gridding, truly biodegrabale packaging, milk and meat alternatives and synthetics,
3D printed materials, modular housing, hydrogen shipping, etc) coming in the next 5 years as this is fundamental to setting a

maximum impact strategy



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
Rising sea levels in particular will be problematic in terms of re-housing those affected. Is there potential for a national insurance

covering climate change to be instigated? People's life savings are in their homes - often in places that will be affected by climate
changed, this can't be overlooked, but needs to be faced head on, without bulldozing people's entire lives in the process.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

This has to happen now. Good to see a government willing to do something. Let's have the hard conversations now, then move on to
a brighter, cleaner, smarter future for all. PS consider the TOP policy on housing and wealth taxation. it's the only way to free up

people's finances from their homes, stop people being so scared of climate change destroying their equity, and will mean we have
more money to invest in new tech.
