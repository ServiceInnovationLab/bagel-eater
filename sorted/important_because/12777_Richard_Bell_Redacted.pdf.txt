A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is The worlds climate is responsible for life, when it changes just
important because...                          slightly small life systems will die and the chain reaction will make its
                                              way to us. Our planet is in pain and without this legislation we are

                                              letting people be hurt more and more. They cost of our inaction will
                                              be the valuable of generations to come.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
Further comments                              Let the holistic knowledge of this land be apart of the solutions for

                                              the future.
