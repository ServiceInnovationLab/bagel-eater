A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Climate Change concerns me because when I think of the
important because...                         consequences of carbon emissions and green house gases, not only
                                             does that affect my possible future, but it also affects the possible

                                             future(s) of my grandchildren, and possibly even my children, if Acts
                                             aren't put in place and immediate movements begin.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                             international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
Further comments                             Let us begin a movement, to be able to give back to the world, what

                                             it deserves.
