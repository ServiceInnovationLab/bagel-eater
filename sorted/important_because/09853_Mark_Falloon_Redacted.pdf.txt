A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Research shows without doubt that unless action is taken to curb
important because...                          greenhouse gas emissions the rise in temperature will create great
                                              hardship world wide. It will affect to a greater degree those people

                                              who are least able to help themselves.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              Our government should be sympathetic to those whose livelihoods
                                              are affected by the move away from using fossil fuels.

                                              Our government should adopt a lively outreach policy acknowledging
                                              that raising living standards world wide and preventing wars will
                                              make a huge contribution to arresting climate change.
