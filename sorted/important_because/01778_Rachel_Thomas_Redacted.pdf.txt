A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Because it is long overdue, and because the state of the
important because...                         environment therefore humans depend on these decisions and
                                             changes for future health, well being and prosperity. Climate change

                                             is a growing force which needs to be slowed and sustained asap!

Long-term target                             I support the target of reducing total greenhouse gases to net zero
                                             by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to ensure
                                             our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible: we
                                             should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                             short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target should be reached

                                             by reducing our own emissions and not by using international carbon
                                             credits, using legally-binding budgets, set 10-15 years in advance so
                                             that 3 budgets are in effect at all times, at a level recommended by
                                             the Climate Commission and approved by Parliament, and reached .

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice and is a part of
                                             making final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
