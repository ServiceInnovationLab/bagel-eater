A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Look, I'm just an average citizen, but it's obvious to me (and should
important because...                          be obvious to anyone else) that climate change is one of the biggest
                                              issues facing us today, and we must do everything we can to slow,

                                              prevent, and eventually reverse it. The way we impact the
                                              environment as a country affects not just us, but the entire world - it
                                              is the poorest across the globe who will suffer first and suffer most,
                                              and we have a duty to not only do everything we can as a country,
                                              but to lead by example and urge our global neighbours to do the

                                              same. We must work together, and to do that we must work.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible. This target should be reached by reducing our own
                                              emissions and not by using international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              We need to think about the future, not just the now, and others, not
                                              just ourselves. The only world worth having is a world for everyone.
