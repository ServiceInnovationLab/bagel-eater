A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is The dreadful damage to our beautiful planet MUST STOP ... All Life
important because...                           has been horribly affected and many species killed off permanently
                                               because of the pollution and poisons created by human greed. All

                                               Life has the Right to live and enjoy their own natural existence on a
                                               clean green Planet Earth !

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
Further comments                               Thankfully this Government is thinking beyond National's NINE

                                               YEARS of narrow selfish money-grabbing ideology - making that
                                               'clean green NZ' claim an embarrassment to intelligent, caring and
                                               aware Kiwis. Please make this our 'Nuclear Free Moment' - which
                                               action by Labour and David Lange made us proud to live in NZ - so
                                               Labour/Greens/NZFirst YOU can achieve this - PLEASE let NZ 'Show

                                               the World' again !
