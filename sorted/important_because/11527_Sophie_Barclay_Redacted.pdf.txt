A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We need to act now. The future of our food, weather, species of flora
important because...                          and fauna and population depend on a stable climate. Climate
                                              change has wide reaching effects from impacting weather cycles

                                              leading to drought to inhibiting the ability of calcium carbonate I.e.
                                              mussels and kina shells to properly form in increasingly acidic water.
                                              We need to do something immediately as continuing on a business
                                              as usual track, and not including agriculture in any sort of carbon
                                              plan, is a poor and unethical choice for our country. We must do

                                              more.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              Agriculture must be included in any future carbon plans. To not
                                              include it is a cop out as nearly 50% of emissions are associated with

                                              agriculture.
