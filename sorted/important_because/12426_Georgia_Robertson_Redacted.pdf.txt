A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is It is no longer acceptable to fail to take action to reduce the negative
important because...                          effects caused by climate change. The Zero Carbon Act sets a critical
                                              regulatory framework for all stakeholders to adhere to across all

                                              sectors in order to achieve its targets. It holds New Zealanders and
                                              New Zealand institutions accountable and responsible for how we
                                              treat and more importantly value the environment. As a young
                                              person environmental sustainability is a key concern and New
                                              Zealand has the opportunity to be, and should be, a global leader in

                                              this space.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              The work that Generation Zero have done to place the Zero Carbon
                                              Act on the top of public agenda is an inspiration and demonstrates

                                              active citizenship in for the benefit of the future of New Zealand and
                                              the world.
