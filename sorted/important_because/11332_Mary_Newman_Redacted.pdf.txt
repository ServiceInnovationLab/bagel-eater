A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We need to take greater steps to fulfil our commitment to the Paris
important because...                          agreement. Climate change is the most important issue facing us
                                              because it will affect all aspects of our lives: environment, changes in

                                              settlement patterns with rising sea levels, agriculture and food
                                              production and climate refugees.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions. I would also like the Commission to monitor progress
                                              towards targets.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

                                              I also would like to see strong support (financial and advisory) being
                                              given to local government who have to make difficult decisions on
                                              how their communities adapt to, and possible relocate due to,
                                              climate change.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
Further comments                              I support a climate change target of Net Zero Emissions. Although

                                              this is ambitious it would initiate greater incentives for innovation
                                              and changing land use, as well as taking the most holistic approach
                                              to the reduction of emissions.
