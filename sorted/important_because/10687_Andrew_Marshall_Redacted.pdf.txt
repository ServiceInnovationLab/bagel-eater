A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Our first son, Toby, is 5 months old. Our dream would be that he
important because...                          grows up in a country where he can thrive! We (Miriam and I) believe
                                              this act will be an incredibly important step towards being

                                              responsible kaitiaki of our environment. When our physical world
                                              thrives, we have a much better opportunity to thrive too.. This is
                                              absolutely worth doing well, and doing soon. On behalf of our
                                              whanau and future whanau, please put aside any politics and show
                                              strong and bold leadership, not for short term profits, but for long

                                              term gain.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
