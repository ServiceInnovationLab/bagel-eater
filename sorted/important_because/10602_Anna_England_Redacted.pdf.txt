A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We need this law to ensure that New Zealand is a safe and healthy
important because...                          country for people to live in. I cannot imagine bringing children into a
                                              world that is heading towards such an unsustainable future. The Zero

                                              Carbon Act makes me hopeful that there will be a secure future for
                                              New Zealand's future generations.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts that are recognised as leaders in climate
                                              action and environmental science fields. They must act as a check on
                                              the Government to ensure environmental policies are upheld, and

                                              have a significant influence in the overall decision making on
                                              environmental matters.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
