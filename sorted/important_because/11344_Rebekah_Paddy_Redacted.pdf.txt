A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We need to be more proactive about our country and the planet, it's
important because...                          longevity and looking after it for future generations.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              This is a critical time and need for change and it is time for the
                                              Government to be strong enough to make these changes. This would
                                              send a strong message to the rest of the world, national industry,
                                              local bodies and the public that we all need to be protective of the

                                              environment and the planet to turn around climate change. It is not
                                              simply up to individuals.
