A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Creating this legislation is important because individuals and
important because...                           businesses will often ignore the effects of their activities on climate
                                               change unless there is a legislation that requires them to comply or

                                               pay associated costs.
                                               Climate change will likely be one of the biggest challenges of the
                                               future generations and we need to minimize and then eliminate our
                                               contribution for the sake of both New Zealand and the whole world.
                                               Letâ€™s set an international example.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                               international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it avoids passing on
                                               the costs to future generations.
                                               Activities that occur between the countries such as air travel and air /
                                               sea cargo transportation should not be exempted from this

                                               legislation.
Further comments                               This legislation should incorporate and apply to airplane travel and

                                               air / sea cargo traveling between the countries. This could be
                                               incorporated into the cost of the tickets and goods.
