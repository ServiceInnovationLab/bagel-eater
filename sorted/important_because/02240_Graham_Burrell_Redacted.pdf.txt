A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is if are children are to have a future we need action on reducing our
important because...                          greenhouse gas emissions - it is a pretty simple concept - action
                                              means our kids have a future - no action means they don't

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                              international carbon credits.

Further comments                              Trade needs to be "married" with the climate laws. There is no point

                                              and it is illogical to make the production of a "thing" in NZ
                                              uneconomic through the Zero Carbon Bill/Act and then import that
                                              "thing" from another country where it is manufactured with a higher
                                              carbon intensity. That will have the exact opposite effect of reducing
                                              our carbon footprint. Therefore there must be a mechanism to
                                              account for the carbon footprint of all imported products and

                                              domestically produced products too or alternatively only trade with
                                              other countries with a similar Zero Carbon Law (politically
                                              unpalatable I imagine). Without doing this our net Carbon Footprint
                                              will only increase.
