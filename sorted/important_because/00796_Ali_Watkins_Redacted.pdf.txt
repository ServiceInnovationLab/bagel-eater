A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is we are far above the recommended safe levels of greenhouse gases
important because...                          in the atmosphere and as a result Climate Change is accelerating.
                                              We need legislation in place to turn away from a fossil fuel economy

                                              to a fossil-free economy. In 2015 our government signed a global
                                              agreement to reduce carbon emissions, but since then government
                                              and business have done little to honour this. commitment,

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              We want to build a world of community-led renewable energy to
                                              build a future that's free from the destructive impacts of climate
