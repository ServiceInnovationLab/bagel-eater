 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We have no time to lose. If we cannot stop climate change below 2
 important because...                         or 3 degrees our species may become extinct. It does not matter too
                                              much for me, but what about the younger generation?

 Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                              international carbon credits.
 Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

 Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
