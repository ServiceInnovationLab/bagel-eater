A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is
important because...                           We need to change the way we interact with our environment.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               We need to base our use of resources on those that are renewable
                                               and part of the natural life cycle in the right proportions to keep our
                                               systems balanced.


                                               We need to ensure that the relignment of our economy is in a
                                               manner that is more inclusive than the one we have at present (so
                                               that more of our disadvantaged population feel included in our
                                               society).


                                               We need to ensure that as the affects of our pollution begin to affect
                                               our neighbours we are in a position to help them or assimilate them
                                               into our society. (the likes of the pacific peoples that are displaced
                                               by rising sea levels)


                                               If we don't act now then as our population increases we will cause
                                               more population of the nest we call earth.
