A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Climate change is a global problem and this act provides NZ with the
important because...                          opportunity to demonstrate leadership on dealing with this serious
                                              issues. We need to act now, and fast and show the rest of the world

                                              we are prepared to reduce our consumption to limit our impact and
                                              foot print on this massive scale and such an important action not just
                                              words on a document that will end up in the rubbish. I know that
                                              2050 is far tooooo late we need to action this target and 2030 is
                                              realistic and everyone needs to roll their sleeves up and make this

                                              happen...

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2030. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              I know that 2050 is far tooooo late we need to action this target by
                                              2030 it is realistic and everyone needs to roll their sleeves up and

                                              make this happen. Otherwise we say goodbye to our beautiful
                                              planet..this is serious and we need action NOW...
