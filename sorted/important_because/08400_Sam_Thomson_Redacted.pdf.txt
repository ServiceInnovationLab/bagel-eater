A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Zero Carbon act is important because it bring clear environment,
important because...                         plus in new source of energy and renewable energy will improve.
                                             Future should be green. Plus it will improve the health. But it should

                                             not impact on a costs of all people in NZ now and in future.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                             international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                             The law should be work for help NZ. Improve NZ environment and
                                             life itself, but not impact much on prices and bring the best to a

                                             community.
