A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is It is the moral thing to do. Global warming is a critical global issue
important because...                          and NZ needs to take a leadership role - if we can do it, others can
                                              too. We recently had a child (6 months old now), I want him to grow

                                              up in a world that can boast that we overcame such a critical global
                                              issue. I don't want him to grow up in a world that is being devestated
                                              by the effects of GW!

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
