 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Government legislation is required to construct a more
 important because...                          evnviromentaly friendly country because despite individual company
                                               efforts, companies will always have a profit requirement. If a law is

                                               created, it’s not an optional extra, just part of the paperwork. The
                                               government can lead our country on the path to preserving what we
                                               have and living up to our country’s clean green image.

 Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

 Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it ensures a just

                                               transition for workers and communities; and avoids passing on the
                                               costs to future generations.
