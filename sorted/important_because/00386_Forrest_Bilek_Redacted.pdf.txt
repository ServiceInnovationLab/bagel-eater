 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is As a parasitic species living on Earth, I hope we are smart enough to
 important because...                           not destroy our host. Intelligent parasites do not drive their hosts to
                                                the point where parasitic life is no longer possible! This law is

                                                essential for New Zealand and human survival on Earth, as it
                                                provides an example for other nations to follow. When large
                                                countries are too slow to change, small countries must pick up their
                                                slack and show that there is a carbon free future possible, provided
                                                the laws are put in place to make the change happen.

 Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                                gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                                approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                                as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                                while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                                should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                                international carbon credits.
 Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                                that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                                final decisions.

 Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                                Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                                avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

 Further comments                               I fully support this Act with all my heart, and believe it is the best
                                                way forward for New Zealand. Its ramifications would provide for
                                                more kiwi ingenuity to proliferate throughout the world, and NZ will

                                                be seen as a prime example of intelligent law design to combat the
                                                greatest threat humanity has ever faced.
