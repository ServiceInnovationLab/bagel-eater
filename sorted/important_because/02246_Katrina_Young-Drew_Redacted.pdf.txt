A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is we have to do a lot more than what we are doing now to slow down
important because...                           the rate of change we are currently witnessing in the environment
                                               for the sake of future generations and only a climate law is going to

                                               achieve that as it will provide and enforce a cohesive policy based on
                                               solid research. Some individuals in this country are doing their best
                                               to effect change my minimising their carbon footprint by using
                                               electric vehicles, sustainable power sources, eating less processed
                                               food etc but that is not enough! We need everyone in NZ working

                                               together on climate change in the most effective and impactful way
                                               possible - the Zero Carbon Act will help drive this behaviour and
                                               subsequent action in all our communities and businesses. I am in
                                               100% support of the ZCA.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
