A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Because it is ignorant to ignore the science on this matter any
important because...                          further and NZ, while only being a small contributor to the global
                                              emissions, can be a leader for change. I also think its time for us to

                                              think more about the ecosystem we live in and less about financial
                                              gain. Many of the strategies within the proposed Zero Carbon Act -
                                              like planting more trees (right trees in the right place!) - will not only
                                              benefit Climate Change, but also the fragile environment we are
                                              currently abusing.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                              international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
