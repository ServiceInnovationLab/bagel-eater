A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is The Zero Carbon Act is extremely important because it will allow
important because...                          New Zealand to contribute to the fight against climate change and
                                              it's detrimental impact on people and the planet. As a developed

                                              country, New Zealand has a responsibility to be one the nations
                                              leading the carbon neutral movement. The future of our planet is at
                                              stake and we need to act quickly to try and reverse the damage that
                                              has already been caused by climate change. Future generations will
                                              be relying on us to provide them with a greener, more sustainable

                                              world.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
