A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We need to look after this planet we inhabit, and inherently the
important because...                          people that occupy it. We are seeing more and more extreme
                                              weather events, as predicted by global warming experts, and as a

                                              result we are seeing more lives being disrupted negatively and too
                                              often ended. And it just makes good sense both economically, as
                                              shown in the recent report (sorry forget who produced it), and also it
                                              just creates a more pleasant place to live. I know Iâ€™d rather breathe
                                              fresh air, compared with sooty polluted air.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                              international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
