A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Being a young person, I know climate change will affect me and
important because...                         eventually my own children. I am concerned that not enough has or
                                             will be done to combat climate change.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                             international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
