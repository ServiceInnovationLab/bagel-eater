A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We need urgent action on climate change which will affect the
important because...                           health, safety & wellbeing of millions of people through sea rise,
                                               displacement, storms, droughts, crops, & even wildfires. We need to

                                               move away from fossil fuels & in to renewable energy like solar &
                                               wind. All (non-active) transport should be electric. IMO All buildings
                                               should have solar, passive heating & cooling design, fresh & grey
                                               water tanks, & EV charging. Changes in agriculture & industry are
                                               also needed asap, & all fossil fuels should be taxed heavily & all

                                               extraction should be stopped.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               The good thing is a transmission away from fossil fuels will lead to
                                               lots of jobs, better safety & health outcomes, less air pollution, huge

                                               reductions in plastics, polystyrene & chemical wastes, less methane
                                               & CO2 emissions & huge savings in potential climate change costs,
                                               as well as slowing climate change extinctions & making crop, trees,
                                               plant, animal, & human species survival more likely.
