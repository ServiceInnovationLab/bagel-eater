A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is important because it will
important because...                          put in place regulation against climate change, which will be
                                              enforceable by the judiciary should it be breached. Currently, the

                                              world is facing a dire situation in that our earth might not be existent
                                              by the time the current generation go to have children. Raising
                                              awareness and promoting lifestyle choices such as veganism is good,
                                              but these are individual choices made at a micro level. The law
                                              affects citizens at a macro level as everyone is subject to the rule of

                                              law, therefore it will force the reduction of emissions by those who
                                              produce them the most such as farmers.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
