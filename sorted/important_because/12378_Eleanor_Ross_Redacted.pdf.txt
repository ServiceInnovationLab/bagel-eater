A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We already have a problem that's bigger than we should ever have
important because...                        let it become. We have a responsibility now to choose the
                                            challenging path of the most ambitious target -- as the current

Long-term target                            I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

Climate Commission                          I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                            that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                            final decisions.

Adaptation                                  I strongly support adaptation as an important part of climate change
                                            response.
