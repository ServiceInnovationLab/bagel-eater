A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I believe that continual changes of the weather patters are causing
important because...                          changes which are unsustainable and unpredictable.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              The generation of electricity by modern Nuclear Power Stations is an
                                              option that MUST be given consideration. I believe that there has
                                              been vast improvements in the safety of Nuclear Power Stations in
                                              recent time.

                                              There is also a difference between the use of Nuclear Energy for
                                              Peacetime use and that of Warships and Nuclear Bombs.
