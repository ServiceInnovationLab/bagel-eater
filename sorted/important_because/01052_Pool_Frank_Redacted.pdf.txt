A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I started working on what tangibly needs to be done to meet GHG
important because...                          reduction targets by NZ action 30 years ago as then Policy Manager
                                              for Energy Management, Ministry of Commerce. 17 years ago I

                                              stopped working in NZ and started working overseas as nothing
                                              tangible was being done in NZ on GHG mitigation. I have now worked
                                              in 40 countries on GHG mitigation projects. It is well past time that
                                              NZ started doing tangible GHG mitigation projects too.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
