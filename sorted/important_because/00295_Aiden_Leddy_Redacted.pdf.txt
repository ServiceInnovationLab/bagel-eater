 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We need to revert the effects of our actions as soon as possible, as
 important because...                           we won't know when we've gone too far before it's too late. We can't
                                                afford to pollute our planet like this, as it really is a real problem that

                                                we as a nation must recognize and take action to fix. We should
                                                know by now that it is not safe to tamper with mother nature, which
                                                is why I support the Zero Carbon Act.

 Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                                gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                                approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                                as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                                while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                                should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                                international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                                that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                                final decisions.

 Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                                Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                                avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

 Further comments                               New Zealand is a wonderful country. We out of all countries in the
                                                entire world have the priceless opportunity to come together and
                                                lead the world back to health through peace and innovation. This is
                                                our time.
