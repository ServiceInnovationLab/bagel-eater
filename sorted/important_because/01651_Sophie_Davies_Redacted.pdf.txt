A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I am concerned as to how oblivious people are to the consequences
important because...                          of Climate change. We can only ignore it for so long. Being from the
                                              younger generation I know that now is as good a time as any to start

                                              making steps towards a cleaner brighter future for New Zealand. I
                                              am aware that change doesn't happen over night, so we need to
                                              take action before it's too late.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
