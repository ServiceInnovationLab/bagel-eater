A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is New Zealand needs to commit to being a truly inclusive society, and
important because...                          to do that, we need to ensure that we are looking after our most
                                              vulnerable people, who will be most effected by disastrous climate

                                              change. A climate law, like the Zero Carbon act, will help to protect
                                              those who will need it the most. It's the responsible, and human
                                              thing to do.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
