A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I would like to see some concerted effort to make a change to the
important because...                          way humanity is dealing with the issue of anthropocentric induced
                                              climate change. The science has been consistent for more than 40

                                              years. has high per capita green house gas rate of emissions and
                                              undemanding reduction targets,weak policy and at a political level it
                                              has proved difficult to take effective action.

Long-term target                              I support trying to become carbon neutral by 2050. I also support
                                              taking a science and evidence approach to reducing our sions.I much
                                              prefer reducing our own emissions than trading international carbon

                                              credits which can require little behavior change at home.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but that the
                                              Government of the day must determine decisions. I hope that multi
                                              party support will be forthcoming. Margaret Thatcher formed a
                                              Climate Commission in many years ago and although her politics
                                              were conservative she was trained as a chemist and understood

                                              atmospheric science. Forty years on needs the same wisdom &
                                              political will.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair to all sectors of the
                                              community; and avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              I recognise that about half 's emissions come from ruminant animals
                                              for which there is currently no simple solution but consider that
                                              inclusion of farming within the legislation, at least at a rudiment ary
                                              level, is likely to lead to behaviour changes and solutions over time.
