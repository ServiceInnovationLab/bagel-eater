A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is wthout it our government and local bodies have nothing to work with
important because...                          to encourage, mitigate and address the radical adaptation we need
                                              to get on with right now.


                                              Our communities are feeling the effects RIGHT NOW and other
                                              countries are leaving us behind

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits. The long term target is that we live in a
                                              liveable country. Without a target we may be living on an island the

                                              size of Tawa by 2090!
Climate Commission                            I enthusiastically support the establishment of an independent

                                              Climate Commission that is made up of experts and provides advice,
                                              but does not make final decisions.

                                              I strongly expect that governments will take their considered advice
                                              and implement it.

Adaptation                                    I very strongly support a plan for adaptation being included in the

                                              Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
