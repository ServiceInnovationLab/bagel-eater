A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is The ultimate risk of destroying earth to the point where we can't
important because...                           survive is too great NOT to act. Giving our children, grandchildren
                                               and so forth a planet riddled with consequences from our selfish

                                               actions is not fair. New Zealand thrives on it's green reputation and
                                               we would do well economically to live up to that reputation (we are
                                               not currently).

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050 or earlier. I also support taking a science-
                                               based approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as

                                               impactful as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived
                                               gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This
                                               target should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by
                                               using international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               Our agriculture industry has too much of an impact on this (and
                                               other environmental problems) to ignore. However when it is so
                                               critical to our economy we must ensure there are measures in place
                                               to support those who will be hurt by any action taken to move away
                                               from agriculture.
