A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Climate change is the biggest threat to our planet's life ever faced!
important because...                         The effects of climate change hit our Pacific neighbours the hardest,
                                             and we need to do something about it, FAST! It's absolutely ludicrous

                                             nothing drastic has yet been done in the 21st C, it's time for NZ to
                                             lead the way and say enough is enough.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                             international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
