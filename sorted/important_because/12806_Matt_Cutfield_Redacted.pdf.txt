A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is New Zealand has the opportunity to lead by example and become
important because...                         early adopters of technologies and ways of thinking that will give it in
                                             edge moving forward. The risks of the world doing nothing on climate

                                             change are potentially very serious and so action needs to have a
                                             strong evidence-based science-based rationale behind it.

Long-term target                             We need to aim to reduce carbon emissions in a prudent / sensible /
                                             economically-viable but still very urgent manner. This target should
                                             be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                             international carbon credits. Efforts should focus on adaption of New

                                             Zealand's economy (including agriculture), transport and power-
                                             production.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
