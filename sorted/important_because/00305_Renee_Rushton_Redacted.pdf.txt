 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I'm concerned that human caused climate change will render this
 important because...                          planet unliveable and to do nothing about this is a horrible choice. I
                                               think this act has the potential to help new Zealanders to do their

                                               share to combat this hopeless trajectory.

 Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

 Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
