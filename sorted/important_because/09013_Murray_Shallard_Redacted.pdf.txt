A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We donâ€™t. Our global commitment means we participate with other
important because...                          countries. The hope is that together we can fairly makechanges that
                                              are sustainable

Long-term target                              I support the basic target of reducing only carbon greenhouse gas to

                                              net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
                                              ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                              we should aim for both, levels of long-lived gases and short-lived
                                              gases to sustainable levels. This target could be reached by using
                                              international carbon credits. Farming must be exempt, yet audited to

                                              better understand its impact.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I do not support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero
                                              Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               Any transitions or costs must be shared equally across society.
                                              Education is priority to individual responsibility.

Further comments                              There should not be increases in the cost offood punishing
                                              consumers for living. Like aviation Farming must be exempt and
                                              carbon sequestration should be targeted to offset NZ agriculture

                                              emissions.
