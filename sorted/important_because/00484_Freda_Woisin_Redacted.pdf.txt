A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is at a time when the most rapid change in the environment is taking
important because...                         place on our planet, compounded by the human factor, who now
                                             number greater populations globally than ever before, dynamic

                                             change in our attitude is urgently needed in the treatment of this
                                             planet we call home. Understanding and implementing reduction of
                                             green house gases- especially the "Western World" so the health of
                                             our environment returns so future inhabitants are not lumbered with
                                             the problem their ancestors created.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                             international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
