A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We only have one planet, and if we want it to continue sustaining the
important because...                         life of humans and all the other species here, we need to take care of
                                             it. Climate change is possibly the biggest threat to our continued

                                             existence on this planet, and it's our responsibility to do something
                                             about it while we still can. New Zealand has been influential in its
                                             stance on nuclear non-proliferation and now it's time for us to lead
                                             the way on reducing carbon emissions.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                             international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides impartial advice.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair, and should honour Te Tiriti o

                                             Waitangi. It should ensure a just transition for workers and
                                             communities; and avoid passing on the costs to future generations.
