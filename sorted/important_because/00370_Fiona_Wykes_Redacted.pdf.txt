 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I think we are fast running out of time to solve this problem, and if it
 important because...                          isn't solved, there is no future for my children, or anyone else. I think
                                               politicians and leaders need to stop ignoring this problem. It's not

                                               going to go away, it's only going to get worse, so the sooner we start
                                               to address it the better.

 Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

 Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
 Further comments                              I think it is important that New Zealand stops worrying about

                                               whether anyone else in the world is doing anything and simply gets
                                               on with doing what we can, as soon as possible. I cannot stress how
                                               important I think this is. I think it needs to be tackled at both national
                                               and local level.
