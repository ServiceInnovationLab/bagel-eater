 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We need to start enacting long-term sustainable actions over short-
 important because...                          term economic gains. The extreme weather changes this year does
                                               not only affect wildlife, but also marginalized communities in the

                                               Pacific who are disproportionately more affected than us, such as
                                               Samoa recently. New Zealand isn't any different to these Pacific
                                               Islands and the more we delay action, the greater the impact of
                                               these disasters will be on us.

 Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                               final decisions.

 Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
