 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Climate change is already happening and many people have been
 important because...                           working to reverse it for many years, solutions exist. Action is
                                                required at all levels, individuals, businesses, community groups,

                                                local and central governement. The Zero Carbon Act is the action the
                                                government must take at the central level so as to do their part and
                                                enable the other levels to operate in the same direction, not against
                                                laggard laws. Let's do this!

 Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                                gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                                approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                                as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                                while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                                should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                                international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                                that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                                final decisions.

 Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                                Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                                avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

 Further comments                               We are all in this together, nature and future generations included.
                                                Let's act now together, it is in our hands. Let's be bold, let's trust we
                                                can make it all together.
