A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is As it stands, we have the benefit of living in a world which is
important because...                          somewhat still inhabitable. Without a reduction in greenhouse gases,
                                              the earth may cease to support all life forms walking its surface.

                                              Whilst we may not see the full effect in our lifetimes, it may seriously
                                              inhibit the abilities and lifestyles of future generations. Let the
                                              history books show that we did all we could to prevent the
                                              destruction of our environment and give our future a chance.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
