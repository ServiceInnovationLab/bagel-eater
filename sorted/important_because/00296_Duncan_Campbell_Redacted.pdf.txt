 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is If we are not changing things for the better today we are just making
 important because...                         it worse for our selfs and the planet tomorrow.

 Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050 or sooner. I also support taking a science-

                                              based approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as
                                              impactful as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived
                                              gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This
                                              target should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by
                                              using international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

 Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.
