A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Looking at the big picture, humans have done enormous damage to
important because...                           the ecosystem ( to life as a whole). Civilisation will not survive
                                               without a dramatic change of direction, from maximisation of

                                               production and profit to restoration of the life systems. Stopping
                                               climate change in the first instance, and reversing those changes
                                               that have already occurred in the long term has to become the
                                               immediate objective of this and many succeeding generations. The
                                               alternative of doing nothing promises a bleak future for humanity.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                               international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               I think the above goals should be as minimum goals. It is possible (I
                                               believe likely) that intensity and rate of climate change will increase
                                               as time goes by, requiring ever more urgent responses.
