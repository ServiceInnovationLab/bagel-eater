A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is we are the kaitiaki of Aotearoa. It would be ethically and fiscally
important because...                          irresponsible not to do everything in our power to reduce the impacts
                                              of human driven climate change. Aotearoa is developed enough and

                                              mobile enough to be world leader in this global movement, thus we
                                              should take this opportunity to show the world that it is not only
                                              possible, but that it can be profitable.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              Be bold when you are considering this act, what is the best that you
                                              can do for future generations?
