A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Climate change will have the greatest impact on the global poor,
important because...                           those who contributed least to the problem and with the least
                                               resources to adapt to it. The only socially responsible response is

                                               urgent and ambitious action. To be honest I am shocked that New
                                               Zealand did not adopt a plan to reduce emissions long ago, but let's
                                               do so now.

Long-term target                               Be ambitious! Definitely zero by 2050 if not sooner. IMPORTANT: This
                                               target should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by
                                               using international carbon credits. We cannot out-source solutions,

                                               New Zealand must bear our share of the costs on home soil.
Climate Commission                             YES TO THIS --> I support the establishment of an independent

                                               Climate Commission that is made up of experts and provides advice,
                                               but does not make final decisions.

Adaptation                                     HECK YES. --> I support a plan for adaptation being included in the
                                               Zero Carbon Act. We are already seeing the effects of climate
                                               change here and MUST plan to address this strategically.

Climate justice                                (1) A Zero Carbon Act must honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi, which at a
                                               minimum should mean that tangata whenua are involved in

                                               designing this legislation, and the legislation should increase not
                                               decrease their ability to self-govern. If there need to be tradeoffs
                                               between forwarding the ZCA OR Te Tiriti, Te Tiriti should take
                                               priority. (2) The Zero Carbon Act should also ensure a just transition
                                               for workers and communities - please ensure welfare support as well

                                               as carefully-planned job training to look after workers affected by
                                               this transition. (3) We (our generation) should shoulder the costs of
                                               this transition NOT pass the costs on to future generations, as past
                                               generations have done to us. This is why I support as ambitious a
                                               target as possible. The cost to us (even if great) will be less than it

                                               would otherwise be if delayed and passed on to future generations.
                                               Personally I am up for paying whatever cost is necessary for their
                                               sake.
