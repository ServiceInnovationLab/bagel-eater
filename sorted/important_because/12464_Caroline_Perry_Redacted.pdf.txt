A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is climate change is the single biggest issue that affects all of us. If we
important because...                          don't tackle it now, it will be too late. I am particularly concerned
                                              about emissions from transport, which affect the environment and

                                              our health. Targeted reductions in emissions from transport, and
                                              measures to achieve that such as increasing movement of freight by
                                              rail and sea rather than road, are essential.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
