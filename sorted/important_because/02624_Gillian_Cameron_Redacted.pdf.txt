A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We have to act now to preserve the future for our children and
important because...                           grandchildren. It is already looking alarming. It is grossly unfair to
                                               put on to future generations the impacts of decisions we are taking

                                               now in terms of lifestyle and industries and get them to bear the
                                               costs. We must adopt a risk averse approach and assume the most
                                               catastrophic situation (such as the melting of the West Antarctic ice
                                               shelf in the next 50-100 years) and make policy decisions based on
                                               the worst case scenario in order to give future generations the best

                                               chances of surviving the catastrophic effects of climate change.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
