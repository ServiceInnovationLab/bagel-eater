A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We need sustainable industries and lifestyles. Government has to
important because...                          help us make this possible. Now is the time for leadership and new
                                              direction. Excessive Greenhouse Gas production is ruining our world.

                                              It must be reduced.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              The progress NZ is now making towards controlling Greenhouse
                                              Gases is encouraging. This is a short and long term issue. We now

                                              have a real opportunity to fix this.
