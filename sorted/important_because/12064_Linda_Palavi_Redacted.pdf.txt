A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is As a New Zealand-born Tongan, my homeland of Tonga, alongside
important because...                          other Pacific island countries are becoming increasingly vulnerable to
                                              the effects of climate change. Due to the lack of resources and

                                              unstable infrastructure that most of these islands have to withstand
                                              these forces, this Act can ensure New Zealand is doing its part in
                                              reducing these effects and thus protecting our neighboring Pacific
                                              countries. For those like myself, who hope to return back to the
                                              homelands with my future children and grandchildren, this Act

                                              proves vital in being able to support and succeed our homelands for
                                              many more generations to come.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
