A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I have read a dozen or more books on climate change by some of the
important because...                          most knowledgeable folk and dozens of articles. At 85 I want to make
                                              the most of my years left and am concerned for the future of my 8

                                              grandchildren (the first getting married next month!). A Zero Carbon
                                              Act is absolutely essential to be able to achieve anything is effective.
                                              It will take initiative, much creativity and courage. Dick Tripp

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
