A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is we only have one planet. I support immediate steps being taken to
important because...                         address the state of the environment, especially New Zealand's
                                             emissions.

Long-term target                             I strongly support the most ambitious target of reducing total

                                             greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a
                                             science-based approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions
                                             are as impactful as possible: we should aim for negative levels of
                                             long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable
                                             levels. This target should be reached by reducing our own emissions,

                                             I do not support using international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
