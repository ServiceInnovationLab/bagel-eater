A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Climate change is right now affecting everyone in the world. There is
important because...                           no way even the 1% can escape the devastating consequences if too
                                               little is done to stabilise the global temperature asap. Every country,

                                               however seemingly insignificant, that puts an effective plan in place
                                               to transition to a a zero carbon future will help to build the necessary
                                               momentum for change elsewhere. The biggest challenge in NZ is
                                               going to change the way agricultural emissions are substantially
                                               reduced. Methane emissions cannot be ignored. Even though they

                                               remain active compounds for far less time than CO2 or NO2, they are
                                               far more potent er molecule and in any case breakdown eventually
                                               into CO2. I support substantial reduction in methane emissions as
                                               well as net zero CO2 by 20150 or earlier.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
