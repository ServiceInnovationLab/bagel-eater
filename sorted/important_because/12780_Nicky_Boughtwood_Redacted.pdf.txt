A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is It is an issue of intergenerational fairness for our children,
important because...                          grandchildren and future NZers. We should also play our part as
                                              international citizens - if every nation, large and small, takes this

                                              action, we can have a chance of addressing climate change.

                                              Businesses and consumers need to pay the true cost of things to
                                              help make it faster to transition to newer technologies and
                                              encourage investment in sustainable business, farming, etc.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                              international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              I support the great work of the Generation Zero team and want there
                                              to be an independent climate commission established and for our
                                              political parties to work together in a non-Partisan way. The sooner

                                              we all make changes, the less it will cost us as a country in the long
                                              run.

                                              I congratulate the coalition government on running this consultation
                                              and have high hopes for a positive outcome.
