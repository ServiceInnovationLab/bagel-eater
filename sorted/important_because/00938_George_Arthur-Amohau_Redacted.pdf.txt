A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is If we do not take swift action on climate change now, I believe it will
important because...                          be too late. I think that it is shocking that New Zealand outwardly
                                              promotes a "clean green" image, but is failing to keep up with the

                                              efforts of some other countries when it comes to issues such as
                                              climate change and sustainability.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050 or sooner. I also support taking a science-
                                              based approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as
                                              impactful as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived

                                              gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This
                                              target should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by
                                              using international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
