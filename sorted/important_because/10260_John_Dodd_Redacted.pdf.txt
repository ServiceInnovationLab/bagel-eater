A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is This is our last chance if we wish to avert catastrophic climate
important because...                           change. The science has been before us for a long time and the
                                               message of a severely damaged environment keeps getting more

                                               compelling, alarming, and very obvious to witness.
                                               I want New Zealand to show the world that we are fully committed to
                                               doing our bit to save the planet. One essential component of this
                                               would be to enact in law the Zero Carbon Act, so that we effectively
                                               eliminate our greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Any other course

                                               of action is insanity in my opinion.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               A Labour/Green coalition is our one chance to enact this vital
                                               legislation.
