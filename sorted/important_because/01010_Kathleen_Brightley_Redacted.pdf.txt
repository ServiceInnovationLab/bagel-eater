A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is It will show our commitment to the lives and well being of our
important because...                          children, grandchildren and all the generations to come.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              We in the democratic “free world” have done much to outlaw
                                              slavery, the worst excesses of racism and the brutal conditions of the
                                              ‘satanic mills’. All of that was done in the face of opposition from
                                              powerful vested interests who fought change at every turn. Now in

                                              the face of human generated climate change we must again stand
                                              up and fight for what is right, no matter how many voices are raised
                                              against us. To bury our heads in the sand is no longer an option!
