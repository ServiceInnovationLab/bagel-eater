 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I have seen for myself the effect of pollution. I remember the pea-
 important because...                           souper smogs in London in 1952- brought on by the use of burning
                                                coal. 12,000 deaths resulted. The 1956 Clean Air Act established

                                                smokeless zones This act dramatically improved the air quality in
                                                British cities.

                                                Sixty years on coal is still for sale in NZ. I see today 'The Warehouse'
                                                in Dunedin sells a (20Kg) bag of coal for $17. Quite a bargain. Six

                                                years ago when I brought this up for discussion at an Otago Regional
                                                Council meeting, I was told it was 'a social issue'. No discussion.
                                                Southern NZ towns mid winter suffer pollution on a scale that affects
                                                health & welfare and are long overdue to become smokeless zones.
                                                In fact New Zealand should be declared a coal smoke free zone

                                                ASAP.

 Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                                gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                                approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions have impact &
                                                we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                                short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target should be reached

                                                by reducing our own emissions and not by using international carbon
                                                credits.

 Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                                that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                                final decisions.

 Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it ensures a just
                                                transition for workers and communities now and into the future.

 Further comments                               I would lke to add a photo but do not see how. :)
