A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Temperatures and sea levels are rising, storms and climate
important because...                           fluctuations increasing and our planet is becoming hotter, drier and
                                               more dangerous to human life. We are living at the extremes of our

                                               adaptive advantage and our plants, animals and food crops will all
                                               soon suffer from increasing temperature and less predictable climate
                                               events. I want to leave the world in a better state when its my time
                                               to go and i think we all do. We need to better look after this blue dot
                                               in the midst of a universe hostile to life. We owe it to ourselves, our

                                               kids, our mokos and all who come after us. Its time we made a
                                               change, a change for good, a change to help our planet and our
                                               people survive - without your vision and our commitment the people
                                               the animals and the plants too will perish - all that remains is a
                                               barren rock - spinning hopeless - in empty space. Lets all make a

                                               change - for good.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               That's all. It's time. It's now - lets make a change - for good
