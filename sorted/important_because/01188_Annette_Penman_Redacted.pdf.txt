A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Everyday now, we can see the impact that humanity has had on the
important because...                         planet. We no longer think in terms of what a person does on one
                                             side of the world as having no impact on us.

                                             So, we as New Zealanders need to stand up and show how we will
                                             proactively make the world a better place. I've always been proud of
                                             New Zealand but we MUST act to protect our environment and the
                                             planet as a whole.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                             international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
