A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is
important because...                        We need to leave a better legacy, and we're smart enough to do this.

Long-term target                            I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                            gases to net zero by 2050.

Climate Commission                          I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                            that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                            final decisions.

Adaptation                                  I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                             A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                            Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                            avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                            It's too hard to do right at the moment - we need to fix the system.
                                            Thankyou.
