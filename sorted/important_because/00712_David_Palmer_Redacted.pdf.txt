A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I am well read on the mechanism, rate and effects of climate change.
important because...                           We have no option other than to accept the forecasts made by the
                                               scientific community of climatologist and to accept that the changes

                                               in weather patterns, sea level rise and changes in fauna and flora
                                               distribution already observed are the early manifestations of global
                                               warming. The role that compound gases play in maintain the earth's
                                               temperature are founded on 150 years of observations and the
                                               correlation between the increased concentration of these gases and

                                               global temperature rise is beyond dispute.(I do not like the term
                                               Impactful in the following section. One interpretation could be that
                                               the necessary measures should impact on sectors of our
                                               communities!!)

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               I would like to see some forewarning as to what obvious measures
                                               couldl be forthcoming in the near future such as restricting imports
                                               of fuel guzzling large vehicles, limiting overseas travel, local produce
                                               production and marketing and phasing out fossil fuel electricity

                                               generation even if this means rationing.
