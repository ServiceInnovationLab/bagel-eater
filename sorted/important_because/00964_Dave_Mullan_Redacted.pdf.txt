A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We feel the changing weather patterns around the world are a clear
important because...                          indication of huge changes that need to be made. We are trying to
                                              be more careful of our trash and we an EV is our only transport, thus

                                              limiting our activities considerably. But we feel the sacrifice is hardly
                                              related to the importance of the issue. We support strongly the
                                              target suggested below.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
