A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We need to end CO2 being emitted into the biosphere to slow down
important because...                          the green house effect! Why? To actually provide an environment for
                                              life to exsist in the future!

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                              international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              The Zero Carbon Act and Commission will provide the strict and
                                              solutions that will enforce change across all sectors! My father is a
                                              farmer and he among other traditional farmers need hard facts,

                                              solutions and alternatives that are both sustainable and profitable. I
                                              believe that the ZCA is the catalyst in the switch to a greener cleaner
                                              economy!
