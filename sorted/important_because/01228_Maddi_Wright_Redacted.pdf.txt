A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Humanity's degradation of the Earth is the most crucial crisis in our
important because...                          entire history. Climate laws, such as the Zero Carbon Act and the
                                              Climate Commission, are not only important but are absolutely

                                              necessary. If we want a sustainable economy, a healthy and equal
                                              population and a planet for future generations to call home, we need
                                              to take these first steps - because this is certainly only the beginning
                                              of the changes we must make - and we must take them as soon as
                                              possible.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                              international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
