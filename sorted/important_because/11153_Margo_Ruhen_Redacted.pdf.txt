A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I want a Nz that future generations can enjoy. On the road to mass
important because...                          change in sea levels our climate will change dramatically. Other
                                              countries such a s they netherlands which is low lyimg are already

                                              planning for the increase in sea level which will alter settlement
                                              areas and affect infrastructure,. We need to make the change to
                                              decrease the massif effect climate change will have on our
                                              environment. It is the first step and the least expensive. We need to
                                              start planning for the sustainable future and to put the welfare of the

                                              planet at the forefront.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
