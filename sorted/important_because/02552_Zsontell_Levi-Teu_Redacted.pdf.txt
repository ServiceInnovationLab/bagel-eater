A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is minimising the adverse environmental impacts of climate change,
important because...                          including those of greenhouse gases, is crucial to supporting
                                              sustainability of the planet as the impacts have implications for all

                                              people today as well as future generations. New Zealand is
                                              particularly prone to the effects of climate change, with sea level rise
                                              posing serious risks to coastal areas, and biodiversity loss
                                              threatening the health of ecosystems. The sooner genuine action is
                                              taken to eliminate emissions, the greater chance we have at

                                              mitigating such issues. As voluntary agreements addressing climate
                                              change have made little impact, a legally binding framework is the
                                              best option to ensure effectiveness of efforts.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
