A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Enshrining climate law into legislation is essential because current
important because...                          human activities are causing catastrophic climate change, the effects
                                              of which will continue to become exponentially worse over time. We

                                              therefore have no choice but to drastically change our activities as
                                              soon as possible to reverse our adverse effects on the climate and
                                              the environment. We must do this individually as well as at the
                                              corporate level, and only a statute like the Zero Carbon Act can
                                              enforce this action.

Long-term target                              I support the target of reducing total greenhouse gases to net zero

                                              by NO LATER THAN 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as effective
                                              as possible. For example, we should aim for greater reductions of the
                                              long-lived greenhouse gases like methane, while reducing short-lived
                                              gases to sustainable levels. These reductions should also be "actual"

                                              and verifiable i.e. achieved by actually reducing our own emissions
                                              and NOT by using international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              which is adequately resourced to provide timely and expert advice to
                                              Government.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for legislated adaptation being included in the Zero
                                              Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               I support a just and fair Zero Carbon Act which has regard for Te Tiriti
                                              o Waitangi as well as minimising any negative transitional effects for

                                              workers and communities, and minimises the costs passed on to
                                              future generations.

Further comments                              Time is of the essence: I believe the ZCA must be on New Zealand's
                                              statute books as soon as possible, and certainly within calendar year
                                              2018.
