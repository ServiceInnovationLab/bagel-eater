A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is looking after our world is just so obvious, for my childrens sake and
important because...                          from a faith perspective I feel very strongly that we need to do way
                                              more to protect our climate from the extreme changes that are likely

                                              to happen if we do not curb our emissions. NZ is also in a great
                                              position to lead the world if we can research effective ways to reduce
                                              agricultural emissions

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              Please act on this very quickly so we achieve targets well before
                                              2050
