A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I watch the news and all the reports on adverse weather events and
important because...                          it concerns me that in the future these will become even more
                                              frequent and severe, with real detrimental effects on how people can

                                              live not only in New Zealand but around the world. I fear for my
                                              children's future and what sort of a world they will have to live and
                                              work in and I think this is why we need this law. If governments don't
                                              legislate to reduce greenhouse gasses, there is no incentive or
                                              inspiration for business or the general population to make an effort

                                              to change the way we live our lives.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
