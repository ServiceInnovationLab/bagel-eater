A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is There is so much waste that is harming the environment, native
important because...                           lands, wildlife and sea life that can be prevented, and by doing any
                                               small bit of action, it can make a difference in the amount of waste

                                               that is produced every year in New Zealand homes. This is especially
                                               crucial to act upon now, since the world population is continuing to
                                               grow and if nothing is done now, the amount of waste that may be
                                               produced in the foreseeable future may be too late. We have already
                                               seen the damages it does to the globe, significantly through the

                                               climate change in various places around the world, and therefore we
                                               need to act upon this crisis right now!

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
Further comments                               There should be no hesitation to make this Act law now, because

                                               there is not point in wasting all our money and time on silly political
                                               and economical inquiries just for the benefit of a richer government,
                                               we should be investing our money and time into the issues that
                                               really matter, which is providing a cleaner and healthier world that
                                               generations can grow up in without the land deteriorating while

                                               humans continue to harm it.
