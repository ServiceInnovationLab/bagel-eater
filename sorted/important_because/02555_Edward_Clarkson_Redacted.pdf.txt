A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Non-carbon energy can be cheaper than carbon the more we use it.
important because...                          We won't have to compete with the rising prices of fossil fuels in the
                                              future if we secure sustainable energy.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                              international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              This is an optimistic goal that we should be taking seriously to make
                                              as realistic as possible. Shame it's unlikely that the third world
                                              countries that will produce the most Co2 in the next century will take

                                              any action
