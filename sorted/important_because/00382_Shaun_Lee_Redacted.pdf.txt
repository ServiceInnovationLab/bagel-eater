 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I am really worried about climate change. Sea level rise and extreme
 important because...                         climate events are endangering threatened shorebird species that I
                                              work with. I want my grandchildren to have the same kiwi summers I

                                              enjoyed. I want to tell them we did everything we could to preserve
                                              whats special about this place.

 Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice.

 Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

 Further comments                             I can imagine politicians ignoring the Climate Commissions advice so
                                              would like to see their recommendations taken more seriously

                                              somehow.
