A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is This is our one chance to make sure the Government implements the
important because...                         best possible climate law for Aotearoa. We need them to hear that
                                             New Zealanders everywhere want the strongest, fairest and most

                                             effective Zero Carbon Act. Please do your best and work together,
                                             forgetting party politics, to make New Zealand a better place for
                                             future generations - and set an example for the rest of the world.
                                             New Zealand can lead the way..

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                             international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                             We may be a small country but we can do great things - Lead by
                                             example.
