 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is The only way climate change can be brought under meaningful and
 important because...                           sustainable control is if countries the world over do the right thing.
                                                New Zealand, like nations everywhere, has no choice but to do its

                                                bit. But it has to be impactful ... any flinching, prevaricating, watering
                                                down of legislation will serve to undermine the future of us all.
                                                Leading by example is crucial, and NZ has historically shown itself to
                                                be a brave adopter of proactive thought and action. NOW, with the
                                                future of all our generations to come at such obvious peril, this is

                                                more important than ever. PLEASE read on for solid suggestions as to
                                                the best way forward.

 Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                                gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                                approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                                as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                                while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                                should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                                international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                                that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                                final decisions.

 Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                                Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                                avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
