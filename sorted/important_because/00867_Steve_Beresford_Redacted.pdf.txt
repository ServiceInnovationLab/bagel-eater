A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is It is my opinion that the importance of this single issue outweighs
important because...                          literally every other aspect of human affairs on this planet with the
                                              possible exception of the prevention of Nuclear Armageddon.

                                              Although the impacts will be faced by future generations we are
                                              none the less Duty Bound to do all within our power today to
                                              alleviate the impact of our actions as the window of being able
                                              prevent future catastrophe rapidly closes.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              This action must be taken and it needs to happen world wide. This
                                              issue cannot be ignored.
