A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is our communities are healthy when our environment is healthy! We
important because...                         need to act now because tomorrow may be too late. Climate change
                                             is bigger than any one political party or any one country, but that's

                                             no excuse for us here in Aotearoa NZ not do do our part. Passing this
                                             Zero Carbon Act is an important step- it's time to live up to our
                                             "clean and green" reputation. Let's lead the way.

Long-term target                             I strongly support the most ambitious target of reducing total
                                             greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a
                                             science-based approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions

                                             have the biggest impact as possible: we should aim for negative
                                             levels of long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases to
                                             sustainable levels. This target should be reached by reducing our
                                             own emissions and not by using international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
