A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We need to make serious in-roads to handling climate change.
important because...                         Reducing carbon emissions is just one of the many things that need
                                             to happen urgently before we damage our environment further.


                                             Progress so far from NZ has been shameful given how we bill
                                             ourselves as clean & green, then watch other countries enact more
                                             effective and ambitious policy.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                             international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                             It's 2018, we've known about Climate Change for over 20 years now,
                                             time is passing quicker than ever, and reactions seem to be slower
                                             than ever with everyone assuming we will just 'figure it out'.
                                             Meaningful policy, change and goals need to be enacted now instead

                                             of waiting on someone else.
