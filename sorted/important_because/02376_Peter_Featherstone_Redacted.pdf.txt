A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is My understanding that to have a healthy nation, a nation free of
important because...                          contamination from industry, farming, and combustion engines that
                                              have continually polluted our waterways our air and our bodies we

                                              need a law that enforces control over all those individuals and
                                              industries who randomly pollute our NZ environment.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also recommend support taking a
                                              science-based approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions
                                              are as impactful as possible: we should aim for negative levels of

                                              long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable
                                              levels. This target should be reached by reducing our own emissions
                                              and not by using international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
