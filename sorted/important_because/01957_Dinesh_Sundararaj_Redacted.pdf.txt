A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Change and the future are inevitable. Change for good and the
important because...                          benefit of humanity, and to have a future for humanity to live in
                                              should be guaranteed. If this climate law lends itself to doing that for

                                              all the New Zealanders here and now, and those who come after me,
                                              then sign me up.

                                              It is not the sole responsibility of goverment, but mine as well to
                                              ensure there is a future.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                              international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
