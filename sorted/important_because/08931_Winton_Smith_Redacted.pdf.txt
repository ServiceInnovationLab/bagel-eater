A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We as a nation need to take responsibliity for the damage we are
important because...                           doing to the planet, to others and to the future; Currenty, NZ is free-
                                               riding on the efforts of other nations who are reducing their

                                               emissions (from which NZ benefits at no cost to us). This Bill and
                                               laws which follow must also ultimately address the growth for
                                               growth's sake economy which drives the consumer culture
                                               responsible for so much environmental (and social) degradation:
                                               technological fix alone will not suffice

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                               international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               I wish to see legally binding 5 year GHG budgets, and an ETS that
                                               prevents the sale or purchase of dubious credits (I also support ring-
                                               fenced carbon taxes)
