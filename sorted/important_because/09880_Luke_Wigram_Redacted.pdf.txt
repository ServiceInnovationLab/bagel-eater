A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is
important because...                         We need to ensure future generations have an inhabitable planet

Long-term target                             I support the target of reducing total greenhouse gases to net zero
                                             by 2030. I also support taking a science-based approach to ensure

                                             our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible: we
                                             should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                             short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target should be reached
                                             by reducing our own emissions and not by using international carbon
                                             credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts, tangata whenua and lay persons, who

                                             provides advice, and makes binding decisions that can only be
                                             overturned by an act of parliament

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                             Cut the crap and get to work. We are thirty years to late already
