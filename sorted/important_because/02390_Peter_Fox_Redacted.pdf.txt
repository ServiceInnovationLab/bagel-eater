A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is It sets goals and targets that meet what is necessary to reduce
important because...                          further harm to both NZ and the world. NZ claims a green image, this
                                              act helps NZ to keep building on this image ass well as doing it's part

                                              in global action against climate change. Most importantly this act will
                                              hold people accountable, and accountability is key if we are going to
                                              implement the changes which are necessary in order to minimise the
                                              effects of climate change.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
