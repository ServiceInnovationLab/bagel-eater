A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is It's literally saving the future! Showing the earth the respect it
important because...                           deserves, and living with the earth instead of just on it. I want to be
                                               able to enjoy the rest of my life in a beautiful clean country and

                                               world, and the zero carbon act will contribute to this! Also, New
                                               Zealand is known for being leaders in all things "green" - let us be
                                               leaders in being a zero carbon country

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               Bloody well do it already!
