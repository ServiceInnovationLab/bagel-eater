A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is The time for action is NOW - before is is too late and certain
important because...                          extinction of life as we know it on the precious planet called EARTH.
                                              We cannot undo the impact of 180 years of destruction of life giving

                                              habitats - we are living with the affects now; loss of polar caps and
                                              glaciers, unprecedented floods, rising sea levels, extreme
                                              temperatures, fires, decreasing productive land and rising CO2
                                              levels, .... BUT we can slow down and in time STOP the progression of
                                              these quite frightening trends ... The TIME FOR DECISIVE

                                              LEADERSHIP FOR ACTION IS NOW!

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
