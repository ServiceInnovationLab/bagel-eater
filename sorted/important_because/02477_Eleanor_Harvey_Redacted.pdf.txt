A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is This is for the future! As children we learnt of a world that was
important because...                           stable, revolving for thousands of years around a sun, the home of
                                               our ancestors and the cradle for the next generation. Yet this dream,

                                               this future for the human race in which our story might one day arc
                                               towards a world of justice and peace, is threatened by the next great
                                               problem of human making. We are stewards of a bounty that is
                                               loaned to us for our lifetimes which we must foster and leave better
                                               than we found it. Let us make progress but not for progresses' sake,

                                               let us run with determination a path towards a future when Aotearoa
                                               is a place which takes an assertive stand to honour the climate.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
