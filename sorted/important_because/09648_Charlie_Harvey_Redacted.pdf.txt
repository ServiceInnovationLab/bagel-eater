A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is because there is no back up Earth. Our existence on this planet has
important because...                          done nothing but harm it. Now is the time to step back from the
                                              political and economic pressures and place our country at the

                                              forefront of a system that nurtures and protects the environment so
                                              that it thrives, and not just survives. We must show the same
                                              compassion to those generations that are to come as we do to those
                                              who already inhabit this planet.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
