A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We need to preserve the world around us. 8 million metric tons of
important because...                         plastic are thrown into the ocean annually. This is just one of the
                                             many tragic things we as humans are doing to destroy the precious

                                             life around us. New Zealand is meant to be clean and green and yet
                                             we are not meeting our expectations as country.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science and
                                             engineering-based approach to ensure our efforts to reduce
                                             emissions are as impactful as possible: we should aim for negative

                                             levels of long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases to
                                             sustainable levels. This target should be reached by reducing our
                                             own emissions and not by using international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
