A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is This beautiful country is our home. I think that it is so important that
important because...                           we preserve and value our beautiful space by preserving our natural
                                               environment and the health of our natural environment. We have

                                               these incredible glaciers that are melting away so quickly. Our
                                               shorelines are rising. NZ is home. It’s a sacred and special place to
                                               me and my family and I want to see us all taking care of our beautiful
                                               home. We need the governments suppor through the zero carbon act
                                               to really achieve this

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                               international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               Let’s look after our country! We have the privilege of living in the
                                               best place on earth! Let’s honour that!
