 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We are already seeing and experiencing the negative effects of
 important because...                         massive burning of fossil fuels during the past century. Climate
                                              change is already here. Ongoing growth is unsustainable. The

                                              situation is urgent. For the sake of our children and future
                                              generations as well as other species and the planet itself we need to
                                              make immediate changes to our lifestyle, food production and
                                              industry in order to reduce greenhouse gasses to net zero by 2050.

 Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

 Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
