A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Climate change is often called an ‘existential threat’. What this
important because...                          means to me is that it will make our common home, this beautiful
                                              planet, unliveable for my grandchildren and even perhaps my

                                              children. All the other causes I care about pale into insignificance
                                              compared with this reality. To avert disaster we need action at
                                              government level, and the action must be swift and rigorously
                                              carried out. Anything less than total commitment by our government
                                              and others around the world must be considered as ‘fiddling while

                                              Rome burns’.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
