A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Climate change scares me. I like to think I fall somewhat into the
important because...                           brave kiwi archetype, I try and push myself and not let anything
                                               frighten me, but the idea that myself and the children I hope to one

                                               day have could live in a world devastated by rising oceans and
                                               biodiversity loss terrifies me. I grew up loving nature and everything
                                               it had to offer, I grew up hoping that I wouldn't be the last generation
                                               to know and love nature. I am not kidding myself, climate change is
                                               a threat to our survival as a species and I think laws like the Zero

                                               Carbon act are our best chance to combat said threat.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
