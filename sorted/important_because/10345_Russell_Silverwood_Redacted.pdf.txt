A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act will not only send a clear
important because...                           message that the time for change is now but also create the
                                               necessary financial incentives that allow businesses to change

                                               behaviours and transition to a zero carbon model without unfairly
                                               disadvantaging those who move first. This even playing field can
                                               only really be accomplished through a law change such as this.
                                               Expecting change in industries across the board in time to mitigate
                                               the rapidly increasing effects of human driven climate change

                                               without a comprehensive model like the Zero Carbon Act is simply
                                               unrealistic.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
