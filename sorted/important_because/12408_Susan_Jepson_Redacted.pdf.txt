A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We are running out of time to control the heating of the planet. It is
important because...                          very likely too late to prevent us going above the 1.5 degree rise -
                                              there is a 30 year time lag in the heating of the atmosphere with

                                              what is already there.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              We need strong leadership that can manage the complexities of
                                              transition away from reliance on fossil fuels. People need

                                              reassurance about what needs to be done and how secure they will
                                              be as we transition. The deniers and naysayers need to see that the
                                              Govt can carry through with the transition.
