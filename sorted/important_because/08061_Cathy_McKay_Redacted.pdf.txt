A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is In my opinion climate change has been our primary problem for
important because...                          decades now. While failure to act already has caused disruption from
                                              which the planet cannot now fully recover it is still important to put

                                              measures in place to reduce the harm caused by economies based
                                              on growth and extraction. These measures should be stringent and
                                              put in place as rapidly as possible.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              It is imperative that we accept that climate change is causing
                                              widespread damage already. Our personal experience is that sub-
                                              tropical downpours are causing slips and washouts which have cost
                                              tens of thousands to repair and that waterlogging followed by
                                              drought is causing mature trees to die much faster than we can

                                              replace them.
