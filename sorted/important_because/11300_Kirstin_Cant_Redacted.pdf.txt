A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is It means that there will be a radical change: As a country, we will all
important because...                           be obligated to do what is necessary to change their lifestyle/working
                                               habits to meet Zero Carbon standards. (especially

                                               institutions/businesses making these changes) Without such an Act
                                               being put into place the small efforts that individuals and businesses
                                               make not make enough of a different in time for this critical situation
                                               for our land, and our people. Climate Change is not only an issue of
                                               Environmental Justice, it is also an issue of social justice with many

                                               people's lives being adversely affected because of the ways we are
                                               allowed to pollute and abuse the earth.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
