A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is The issue of climate change needs to be addressed now and the cost
important because...                          of adaptation/transition to a net zero carbon emissions future borne
                                              by all present and future generations. Future generations will already

                                              be forced to bear the financial cost, social burden and environmental
                                              impact resulting from the actions of previous generations and
                                              policymakers. Let's not also laden them with this responsibility alone
                                              while providing immunity to those who have largely been the
                                              architects and beneficiaries of practices that have contributed to

                                              climate change!

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
