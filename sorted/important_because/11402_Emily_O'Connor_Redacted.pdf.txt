A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is there has been far too much time wasted trying to reassure business
important because...                           and the general public, that things won't need to change too fast or
                                               too drastically. It is the NZ government's job to take decisive action

                                               and protect future generations from the disaster that is, unless big
                                               changes are made, current and inevitable.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
Further comments                               The short/medium-term cost and inconvenience of reducing

                                               greenhouse gases seems to be a real barrier to action in the public
                                               and business spheres. I hope the government of the day is able to
                                               work towards the long-term goals by making short-term, difficult
                                               decisions. The science is unambiguous, and action needs to be
                                               taken, and fast.
