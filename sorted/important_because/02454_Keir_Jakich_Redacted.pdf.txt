A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I care about this because my parents’ generation didn’t seem to
important because...                          know how to. Our generations now not only know how we must care
                                              about it, but also why and how to fix it - there is no reason for

                                              inaction. We must address it Because we owe the next generations
                                              more than we had, not less. And Because the natural environment is
                                              the most enriching thing that we have and because so many key
                                              pieces of it are at risk, not just one or two.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              I will vote with, work with, and help every step of the way.
