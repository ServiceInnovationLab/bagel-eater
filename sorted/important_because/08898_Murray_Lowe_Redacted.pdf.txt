A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I want a future of hope not despair, for our generations to come and I
important because...                         am very proud to think that is young New Zealanders who have put
                                             this Bill forward and my older generation need to get behind it.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                             international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                             Consideration needs to be given as to how the Zero Carbon Act and
                                             the Resource Management Act would interact. It would seem
                                             sensible, if feasible for the Environment Court to give effect to the

                                             Zero Carbon Act.
