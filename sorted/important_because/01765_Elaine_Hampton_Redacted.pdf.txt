A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is because the only real asset we have is the next generation. We need
important because...                          to think 7 generations ahead to include our grandchildrens children.
                                              They will be as concerned for them as we are about our

                                              grandchildren. We are in danfger of bequesthing them an unlivable
                                              world.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits. We need to access the science and start
                                              using it, porous roading, elctricity generation from various sources as
                                              well as solar, wave and wind such as foot traffic, brakinbg systems

                                              on light rail - ah yeas forst we need to move into the 21st century
                                              and put in ligth rail of some sort.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions. And has an expert as chair, not a political appointee.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              We have so liottle time left to be effective.
