A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is It’s about stewardship, and being true to our word. I feel so strongly
important because...                          about this and want to see our government making commitments to
                                              the things it’s people care more and more about.

Long-term target                              Absolutely. Without a lofty goal we will never get the momentum and

                                              the push we need to reach our commitments. Even 2050 May be too
                                              late for the planet.
                                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            We need to hold people to account. I support the establishment of an
                                              independent Climate Commission that is made up of experts and
                                              provides advice, but does not make final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               Treating our planet with kindness and fighting global warming is, in

                                              my opinion, synonomus with the agreements made in the Treaty of
                                              Waitangi. A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours
                                              Te Tiriti o Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and
                                              communities; and avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              Please act. The future of the nation and the world are reliant on our
                                              courage and leadership
