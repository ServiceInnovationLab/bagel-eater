A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is This is important for so many reasons. Because I live near the sea
important because...                          and I don't want my house to be underwater. Because I love my
                                              nieces and nephews and feel responsible for passing to them the

                                              beautiful country that I grew up in. Because I benefit from the tourist
                                              economy and I believe we are currently lying to them by selling
                                              ourselves as 'Clean and Green'. And because I work in the health
                                              sector and I know that emissions play an important part in the health
                                              of myself and my neighbors.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                              international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and excludes members who have a
                                              vested financial interest in continuing to pollute.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              The solution must be science based. It must meet our values and
                                              support our obligations both nationally and internationally. And it
                                              must happen at the absolute top speed possible. We have waited

                                              long enough. Lets aim for the most ambitious target and make our
                                              future proud.
