A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is NZ is capable of making a carbon neutral future a reality. As Lord
important because...                          Deben said, "once we know, we are responsible". Aotearoa has the
                                              responsibility not just to its present citizens but to its future children

                                              to ensure that they have a thriving and safe future. If we can, then
                                              we should.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

                                              I also support the government placing top-down regulations on

                                              industries such as transportation, agriculture, building and primary
                                              industries to ensure that they are part of the solution.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.
                                              I also want the ZCA to have an adaptation fund for countries who
                                              need it most such as SIDS and Asia Pacific countries.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations. It should ensure
                                              that Tangata Whenua is part of the consultations and Climate
                                              Change Commission.
