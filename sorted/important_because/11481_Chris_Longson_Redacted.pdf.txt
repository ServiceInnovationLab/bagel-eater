A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is It provides a clear pathway and strong intent for New Zealand to
important because...                           reach a net-zero emissions goal. It also creates certainty for both
                                               planners, and those in industries or regions likely to be affected by

                                               both climate change and the economic changes necessary to
                                               achieve net zero.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     A plan for adaptation should not necessarily be part of the Act, but a
                                               requirement for government at all levels to plan for adaptation, and

                                               to support communities already forced to adapt, should be part of
                                               the Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations. Any economic
                                               instruments used to reach the net-zero goal should be redistributive

                                               rather than regressive.
