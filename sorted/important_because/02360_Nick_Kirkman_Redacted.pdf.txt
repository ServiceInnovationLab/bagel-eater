A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is All of Humanity needs to act really quickly if we want a chance to not
important because...                           utterly wreck our environment. The truth is that the current IPCC
                                               models assume massive and sustained efforts to permanently

                                               sequester carbon, technology that does not really yet exist and is
                                               certainly not being deployed. (This could be an opportunity for NZ).
                                               Every country needs to set its own example. Inaction is easy when
                                               everyone is inactive. Every country that takes this goal seriously
                                               makes it harder for laggards to keep procrastinating. We must set a

                                               strong and ambitious target to make it clear that we take this issue
                                               seriously.

Long-term target                               I support a target of reducing total greenhouse gases to net zero by
                                               2030, and making NZ increasingly net negative thereafter. This
                                               really needs to happen in all developed countries.


                                               I also support taking a science-based approach to ensure our efforts
                                               to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible: we should aim for
                                               negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases
                                               to sustainable levels. This target should be reached by reducing our
                                               own emissions and not by using international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
