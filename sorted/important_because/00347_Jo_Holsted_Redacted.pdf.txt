 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I want to be able to look my son in the eye when he grows up and
 important because...                          tell him that we made decisions that mitigated a risk to his and his
                                               family's future.

 Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                               international carbon credits.
 Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

 Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

 Further comments                              The worst case scenario of climate change is unthinkably disastrous.
                                               The worst case scenario if we go carbon neutral is... what? A
                                               generally cleaner environment? Let's just do it.
