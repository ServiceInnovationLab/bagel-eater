 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I care about the future of the country. I understand the need for
 important because...                           balance between the environment, economy and societal needs,
                                                however this balance is currently uneven. The Zero Carbon act will

                                                make a difference to the state of the environment, and in doing so,
                                                long term, the economy and society will benefit. I am currently
                                                studying architecture and I realise that as part of my career I will be
                                                making the choice find environmental solutions to built environment
                                                issues, particularly greenhouse gas based problems. I don't believe it

                                                should be a choice for people, particularly professionals as to
                                                whether to be sustainable or not. I think it should be law!

 Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                                gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                                approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                                as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                                while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                                should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                                international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                                that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                                final decisions.

 Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                                Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                                avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
