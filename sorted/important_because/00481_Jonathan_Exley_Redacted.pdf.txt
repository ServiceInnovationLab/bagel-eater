 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Climate change is the biggest threat to our society and reducing
 important because...                          carbon emissions is the most important way to address this threat.
                                               Relying on individuals to voluntarily reduce emissions will not work -

                                               it needs coordination. That is what central government does - makes
                                               laws to ensure society acts in a coordinated manner.

 Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

 Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
 Further comments                              No industry sector should be made exempt from carbon targets. This

                                               issues affects everyone so everyone needs to cooperate.
