A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Climate influences us all, if we don't act now for a fast and fair
important because...                          transition to a fossil free world the repercussions are going to be
                                              disastrous.

Long-term target                              I believe that the target of 2050 should be our absolute maximum

                                              deadline, the sooner we make the transition the better. I support
                                              taking a science-based approach to ensure our efforts to reduce
                                              emissions are as impactful as possible: we should aim for negative
                                              levels of long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases to
                                              sustainable levels. This target must be reached by reducing our own

                                              emissions and not by using international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and who make final decisions on anything
                                              climate related as our future should not be a political matter.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act,
                                              but that certain elements like the deadline on 2050 should be
                                              unchangeable.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
