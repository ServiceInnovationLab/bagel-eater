A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Aotearoa, New Zealand needs a climate law asap due to climate
important because...                          change affecting ocean levels here, in The Pacific and in Antarctica.
                                              Please seriously consider the Zero Carbon Act for our generation, for

                                              our mokopuna and for generations to come. I don`t want to leave a
                                              legacy of high ocean water levels, alpine melt washouts and
                                              coastlines being washed away by increasingly high waves/storms

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              Please act asap for the sake of our children and children to come
                                              plus our country`s, also Pacific/Antarctica`s coastlines.
