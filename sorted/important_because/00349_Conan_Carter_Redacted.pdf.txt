 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is
 important because...                         My children depend on us getting this sorted

 Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

 Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

 Further comments                             We are one of the most blessed nations in earth in terms of available
                                              renewable resources yet we are failing to develop Jes√© fast enough
                                              more wind and solar needs to be built urgently to take pressure off
                                              the hydro lakes and speed up the closure of Lloyd fossil fuel power

                                              generation and fossil fuel heating etc in fonterras factories for
                                              example
