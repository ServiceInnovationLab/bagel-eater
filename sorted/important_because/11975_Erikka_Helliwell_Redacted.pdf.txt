A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We have one chance as a species to ensure the climate will be
important because...                          livable not just for those of us who have access to resources but for
                                              all people living on this planet.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                              international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              Often environmental issues are just thought about in the context of
                                              humans and the planet. we forget that people are made up of more
                                              than just one thing. We have vulnerable people who will bare the

                                              brunt of the impacts to start with. What ever act is passed it needs to
                                              be inter-sectional; thinking about all aspect of the people. From race
                                              to social economic background to there health and disability needs.
