A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is The Zero Carbon Act is vitally important because without stopping
important because...                           the rise in carbon emissions there will be devastating consequences
                                               for all living things on the planet. New Zealand may be a small

                                               emitter of greenhouse gases but cumulatively it all makes a
                                               difference. I have mokopuna who are going to inherit the effects of
                                               lack of action on this worldwide problem and I feel responsible for
                                               that in some way.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits. Methane must be included.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               There must be cross party agreement on this, it is too big a problem
                                               to be used as a political football.
