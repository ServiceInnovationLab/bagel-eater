 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is By nature, human beings have a much more of an impact on our
 important because...                           environment than any other species on the planet. We have the
                                                ability to rapidly change the lay of the land to suit our economic

                                                needs. While I don't currently have children of my own, many of my
                                                friends & family do. With that in mind, it's important to me that we
                                                understand that we are part of a very delicate ecosystem. We
                                                require guidance, restrictions & pathways to ensure that our
                                                continued intellectual advancement is not at the detriment of our

                                                environment & other species whom we share this blue rock with. We
                                                look to our governments to write the rules of the game we are
                                                playing, these rules need to be written with the needs of the many at
                                                the focus, rather than the needs of the powerful.

 Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                                gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                                approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                                as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                                while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                                should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                                international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                                that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                                final decisions.

 Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                                Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                                avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

 Further comments                               We need to look for solutions to our waste management problems.
                                                As a business owner, it would be great if more resources were
                                                directed into R&D for environmentally friendly food grade packaging.
                                                Due to requirements of MPI, we are currently limited to the types of

                                                materials we can use to package our food goods for consumers. I
                                                don't like the fact that we are required to use plastics that, currently,
                                                cannot be recycled in NZ.
