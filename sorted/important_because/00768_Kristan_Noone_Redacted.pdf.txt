A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is You only need to see whats happening around us day by day to be
important because...                          concerned. I cant fathom how intelligent people of power cant seem
                                              to grasp that without the resources and sustenance the earth

                                              provides, we as humans have no way to survive. How can the idea of
                                              prosperity drive you to ignore that without an economy, the value of
                                              money = 0. We have a responsibility to our children and their
                                              children to respect what god so graciously gave us and do
                                              everything to ensure we dont destroy their home.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                              international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              Be bold for a change. Do something different. Create jobs, entire new
                                              business prospects, nuture the land and reap what you sow. We are
                                              always so far behind everybody else. Can we be first for a change
