A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Our government needs to take decisive and ambitious action to
important because...                          mitigate the effects of climate change now. The Zero Carbon Act is
                                              an opportunity for us to show that New Zealand is accountable for

                                              our emissions, for the good of all New Zealanders and the planet.
                                              Being bold, having foresight and setting strong goals and regulatory
                                              mechanisms now is imperative to ensure this is a piece of legislation
                                              with teeth.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
