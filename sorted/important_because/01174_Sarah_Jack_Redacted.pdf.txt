A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We simply cannot carry on as we have been if we want to meet our
important because...                          international climate change obligations or, more importantly, if we
                                              want to preserve the planet in a livable conditional with a functioning

                                              ecosystem. A Zero Carbon Act (ideally with bipartisan support) is the
                                              best way we can ensure that all decisions made across the various
                                              areas of the New Zealand economy are made in accordance with our
                                              carbon reduction targets.

Long-term target                              I strongly support the most ambitious target of reducing total
                                              greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a

                                              science-based approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions
                                              are as impactful as possible: we should aim for negative levels of
                                              long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable
                                              levels. This target should be reached by reducing our own emissions
                                              and not by using international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi, ensures a just transition for workers and communities and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              It is essential that we take brave and decisive action now through
                                              enacting an ambitious Zero Carbon Act.
