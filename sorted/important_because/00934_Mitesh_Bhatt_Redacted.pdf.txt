A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is NZ being the youngest country in the world is producing a lot more
important because...                          carbon and the steps it has been taking to decrease carbon
                                              emissions not enough. It needs to preserve and protect all the

                                              resources it has been blessed with. A climate law will help the
                                              citizens and the government achieve the dream of keeping our land
                                              free from human footprints and decrease global warming.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
