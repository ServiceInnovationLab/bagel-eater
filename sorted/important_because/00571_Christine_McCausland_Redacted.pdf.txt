A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We need to think about the future of the planet for subsequent
important because...                          generations. We need to take responsibility now for our actions and
                                              behaviours and the impacts these are having on the environment.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                              international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              I believe that climate change is possibly the greatest challenge
                                              facing our generation. However my observation is that many people
                                              do not see the impact of small day to day actions on this. I strongly

                                              believe that clear government leadership is required in this regard to
                                              Inspire people towards this goal and give clear rationale of its
                                              purpose
