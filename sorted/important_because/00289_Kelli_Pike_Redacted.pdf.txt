 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We don't have the luxury of waiting, or choosing not to take action
 important because...                          on climate change. I feel positive about the opportunities that will
                                               present themselves if we do this now, and fearful for the future of my

                                               daughter and any future family - if we do't' do something now. I don't
                                               want to be the generation that could have done something but chose
                                               not to for short term economic gain.

 Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2030. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

 Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
