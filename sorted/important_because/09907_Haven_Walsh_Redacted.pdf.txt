A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Climate change presents the greatest threat to our planet and the
important because...                          unique species that inhabit it - including humans

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions. It is critical the commisions are not conflicted in any
                                              way and rigourous selection criteria should be developed.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.
                                              Local authorities need to be approriately funded if they are to bear
                                              the brunt of meeting adaptation needs

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
Further comments                              I fully support the intentions of this legislation - however a more

                                              appropriate name should be given to the act. It's about more than
                                              just carbon and the calling it the zero 'carbon' act confuses the
                                              matter.
