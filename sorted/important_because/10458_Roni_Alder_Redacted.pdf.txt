A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is we need to take a long view of the impact our behaviour is having on
important because...                         the environment and think of future generations. I am concerned
                                             that significant damage is being done to the environment. This could

                                             halted by creating more accountability around carbon emissions with
                                             climate laws a key part in this.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                             international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
