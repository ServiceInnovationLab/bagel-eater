A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We must act decisively while there is still time to control extreme
important because...                           temperature rise above 2 degrees, to avoid the calamitous effect this
                                               would have for people and planet. Although New Zealand is small all

                                               nations must act now to avert disaster. We need to plan to
                                               parachute, not crash land.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and facilitators, and provides advice, but
                                               does not make final decisions. I would like the Commission to be
                                               safeguarded by the inclusion of the need for two-thirds of parliament

                                               to agree to its abolition. It should have the power to audit all Bills,
                                               and have the power to veto those that would actively work against
                                               the targets it sets. It needs to have an education function and budget
                                               as well as for research.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations. The Climate
                                               Commission needs to have an equal balance of Maori and non-Maori
                                               in governance roles.
