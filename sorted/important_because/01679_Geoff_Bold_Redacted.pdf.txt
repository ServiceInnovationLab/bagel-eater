A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is My kids and their kids and their grand kids need a world that is
important because...                          habitable. If you take Waiheke Island which is about 20km long and
                                              tip it on it's end, more than 75% of the air our atmosphere is

                                              contained within this height. The atmosphere is incredibly thin
                                              compared to the size of the earth and we are currently using it as a
                                              dumping ground. This MUST stop.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              I support the quick transition from fossil fueled based vehicles to
                                              more sustainable transport such as electric vehicles. Transport
                                              generates 15-20% of NZ's emissions, and the electric vehicle
                                              technology, and national grid for charging infrastructure, is already
                                              here. This is very low hanging fruit for a 15 - 20% reduction in our

                                              GHG emissions. .
