 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is If we procrastinate any longer, we will either fry or drown.I just wish
 important because...                           govt.would get on with it.Nine years of doing nothing under National
                                                is not what I want to see a labour /Greens govt do, otherwise the

                                                credibility is completely gone -like a cry wolf scenario, nobody will
                                                bother bothering about climate change.

 Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                                gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                                approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                                as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                                while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                                should be reached by reducing our own emissions and NOTby using
                                                international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                                that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                                final decisions. Just dont have farmers on the Comission.They only
                                                ever push their own barrow(and IM a farmer!!!)

 Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                                All sectors, all gasses, in now, so that the pain ,the costs and the

                                                risks are equally shared.
 Further comments                               James Shaws grand announcement was hardly a silver medal effort,

                                                not even a bronze . Sadly , this endless consultation approach after
                                                all these years points more to a plastic milk token.Where is the floor
                                                price for carbon, requested by the market voice over the last nine
                                                years.TheGovt. know whats wrong but dont seem to wish to fix it. I
                                                dont think anything will change at all(yawn)
