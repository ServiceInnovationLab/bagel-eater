A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is No law, no formal action and we stay limited to voluntary
important because...                          participation toward helping the world's mad rush toward self
                                              destruction. Naysayers still exist and a law is needed to ensure that

                                              they too do their part. And NZ is NOT too small to fly the Zero Carbon
                                              flag, the excuse given by many to do nothing. We have to have a
                                              Zero Carbon Act!

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              Lets take a lead there are still far too many nations doing nothing
                                              and one of the biggest in particular needs to be shown up and called
                                              out by us small nations for going backward under its current POTUS!
