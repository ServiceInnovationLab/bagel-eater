A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is In order for the people of New Zealand to take the real threat of
important because...                          climate change seriously we need targets to address it written into
                                              law. It is the responsibility of our current government to protect our

                                              world for future generations, not leave it to them to suffer for our
                                              lack of effort. Those of us alive now have contributed to the current
                                              situation of unsustainable greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,
                                              therefore we need to contribute to it's reversal.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              Costs to all people now and ensuring equity is an important
                                              consideration but must be considered in comparison to the costs
                                              involved in the future if we don't do enough now. Please be
                                              ambitious. Lead the way.
