A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Zero Carbon Act is important because it raises awareness of the
important because...                         negative effects of climate change and the policy of the act insures
                                             the future of our planet for the generation to come.

Long-term target                             To reduce the negative effects of climate change and to produce

                                             better economical, efficient, and environmental friendly power
                                             sources backed by science-based researches.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
