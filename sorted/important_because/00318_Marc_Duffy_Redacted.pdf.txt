 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Because it ensures activities have to take in to account the carbon
 important because...                           footprint they leave behind. It means it is more difficult for activities
                                                to to be undertaken in a manor the passes the cost of externalities to

                                                future generations or across boarders to other regions or users.

 Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                                gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                                approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                                as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                                while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                                should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                                international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                                that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                                final decisions.

 Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                                Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                                avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

 Further comments                               Don't keep this wrapped up in bureaucracy for too long !!! people get
                                                complacent, and this will get swept back under the rug bythe next

                                                political whim !!!

                                                Do it right and Do it Now !!
