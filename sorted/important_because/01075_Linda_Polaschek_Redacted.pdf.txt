A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I want to leave NZ and the world in a healthy state for my
important because...                         grandchildren and generations beyond.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions have the most
                                             impact as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived
                                             gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This
                                             target should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by
                                             using international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                             Thank you for this chance to make a submission.
