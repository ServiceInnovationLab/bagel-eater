A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is No matter how hard we try to avoid thinking about Climate Change
important because...                           as a reality, it has already started to take effect in New Zealand!
                                               Severe storms, flooding, drought across Aotearoa and rising sea

                                               levels worldwide (swallowing some of our Pacific neighbours
                                               already!) are just a few symptoms that the earth is sick, and will
                                               continue to give us more and more visible signs that something
                                               needs to change until it's too late. If we act NOW, we may have a
                                               small chance of reversing the damage we've caused for years.

                                               Please help us to do so. The time is now. Not tomorrow. Now.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               Thank you for paving the way forward in a government that strives
                                               for kindness.
