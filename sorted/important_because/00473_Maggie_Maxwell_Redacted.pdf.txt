 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is It's possible that we have already left it too late to stop irreversible
 important because...                          global warming. I hope with all my heart that is not the case and that
                                               we still have time to keep our planet habitable for our grandchildren

                                               and the generations still to come. The strongest action possible is a
                                               matter of great urgency and governments worldwide must play their
                                               part. Despite many years of warning from our climate scientists, New
                                               Zealand has been slow to act. I support the Zero Carbon Act and am
                                               grateful for the dedication of Generation Zero that has made this

                                               submission possible.

 Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

 Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
