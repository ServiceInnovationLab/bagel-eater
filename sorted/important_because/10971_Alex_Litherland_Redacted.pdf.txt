A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I'm a science teacher of intermediate students. By the year 2050 I'll
important because...                           be 65 and my students will be in their 30's and 40's. Though we are
                                               already experiencing the effects of climate change, young people will

                                               be experiencing the worst parts of it; namely from the lack of
                                               inaction by previous generations. The Zero Carbon Act isn't just
                                               important, it's vital as all members and sectors of society will be
                                               impacted. The Zero Carbon Act means that young people will
                                               actually have a stake in their future, otherwise whats the point in

                                               moving ahead without ensuring the best conditions for future
                                               generations? This Act is a huge opportunity for New Zealand to be a
                                               world leader on Climate Action; that will shape society, business and
                                               environment in the best possible way.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
