A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is we live in a dying world, and we need to try and do everything in our
important because...                          capability to try and reverse this process before it is too late. I want
                                              my child to grow up thinking we did our best to help the

                                              environment, not that we hastened its destruction.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits. I also think that Aotearoa New Zealand,
                                              with its "clean, green" international image (regardless of how correct
                                              or incorrect this image is), has a key role to play in encouraging
                                              other countries to commit to improved climate outcomes.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
