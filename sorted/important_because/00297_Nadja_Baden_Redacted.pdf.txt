 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is As the climate increases and the earth deteriorates, so do we, as our
 important because...                          health is directly dependent on the health of our planet. Due to our
                                               reliance on the earth, it is our responsibility to look after it the same

                                               way that it looks after us. The Zero Carbon act will be a huge step
                                               towards tackling this issue as there will be much fewer greenhouse
                                               gases contributing to climate change.

 Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

 Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
