 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I am extremely concerned about the impact on the environment here
 important because...                           in New Zealand as well as in all countries overseas. As well, I am
                                                extremely concerned about the melting of the ice caps and glaciers

                                                in the Artic and Antarctica. I am extremely concerned about the loss
                                                of habitat for all species. I have been taking public transport for
                                                years since this first became an issue at least ten years ago to try to
                                                assist. I am stunned by how cavalier many people are about this
                                                issue giving no thought to it whatsoever as to how they live their

                                                daily lives. We need widespread education programmes on climate
                                                change. We must have science-based policy which is adhered to by
                                                all parties. We must not have politicians in power who continue to
                                                deny the existence of climate change.

 Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                                gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                                approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                                as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                                while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                                should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                                international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                                that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                                final decisions.

 Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                                Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                                avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

 Further comments                               This is one of, if not the major issue of our time and all people
                                                everywhere must work to combat it. As well the New Zealand
                                                government needs to bring in laws that require compliance around
                                                this issue.
