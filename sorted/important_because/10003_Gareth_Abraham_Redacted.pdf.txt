A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I just believe it is a great law that will provide some enforced
important because...                          accountability for New Zealanders and people visiting and trading in
                                              NZ. It will help to retain what we all enjoy- a beautiful country with

                                              healthy wildlife and waters.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              Let's do it government. Once it's passed it will make life better for
                                              everyone especially our younger ones. We will wish we had of done it

                                              earlier.
