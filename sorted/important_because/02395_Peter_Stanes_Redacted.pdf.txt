A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is important because I want
important because...                          my children and their children to have a planet without gross
                                              extremes of weather, inundation of coastal areas from rising sea

                                              levels, food and water shortages resulting from droughts and floods
                                              and, as a bonus, to have a cleaner atmosphere to breathe without
                                              the smog creating fumes and dangerous micro particles produced by
                                              diesel and petrol driven transport.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
