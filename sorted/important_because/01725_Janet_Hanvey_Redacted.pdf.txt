A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Climate change is the biggest public health issue we face and its
important because...                         impact is being seen right now. We need to take courageous steps to
                                             safeguard our environment and, importantly the health of our

                                             citizens, now and for future generations. I would be very proud as a
                                             Kiwi to know our leaders are prepared to be bold and pass this Bill.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                             international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts, including iwi representation, and provides
                                             advice, but does not make final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.
                                             It does however need to be balanced with strong mitigation

                                             measures.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations. I feel Very strongly
                                             about this point.
