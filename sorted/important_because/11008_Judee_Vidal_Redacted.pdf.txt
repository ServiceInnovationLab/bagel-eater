A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is New Zealand has an opportunity to put a line in the sand that will
important because...                           ensure that future generations are living in a safe and healthy
                                               environment. We must act NOW to limit the destruction caused by

                                               emissions - vehicular, electricity generation and agricultural..

Long-term target                               I support New Zealand's commitment to reduce total greenhouse
                                               gases to zero by 2050.
                                               I also support the adoption of science-based approaches to reducing
                                               emissions so that they are as effective and impactful as possible.
                                               New Zealand should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while

                                               reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. We should reach
                                               this target not by using international carbon credits, but by reducing
                                               our own emissions.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               comprising experts to advise elected officials including Ministers, so
                                               that final decisions are informed and future-focussed.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation that will be included in the Zero
                                               Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair, and reflect New Zealand's

                                               commitment to future generations. It must:
                                               - honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi;
                                               - ensure just transition for workers and communities;
                                               - avoid passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               Though New Zealand's parliamentarians are elected for a mere 3
                                               year term, the Zero Carbon Act is an opportunity for them to serve
                                               not only their constituency, their personal agenda, and the country

                                               by adopting a forward-thinking strategy.
