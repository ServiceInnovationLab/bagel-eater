A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is If we don't take action soon the effects of climate change will make
important because...                          life for future generations very bleak.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits. Pay New Zealanders to grow trees, give

                                              incentives for electric or hybrid cars and other forms of transport,
                                              reduce the number of cows and encourage sustainable farming
                                              practices with high quality end products

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions. It must have teeth and be well funded.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.
                                              If we don't have a plan and stick to it nothing will happen.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              This is one of the most important things that the government can
                                              achieve, our nuclear free moment, we can't afford to wait nor can we
                                              trust future right wing governments to undertake this essential work.
                                              We need to turn hearts and minds of all New Zealanders and take
                                              our place again as leaders in the world on progressive policies.
