 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Without legislation, businesses are compelled to operate under the
 important because...                          logic of pure capitalism - even with the best intentions, when it
                                               comes time for major decisions it will always be profit and efficiency

                                               first. Unless all business is required to operate on a level playing
                                               field, this won't change. We know that we need to change our
                                               practices, and we know that legislation is the best (only) way to
                                               make this happen.

 Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                               final decisions.

 Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
