A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is the most vulnerable people in the world and in Aotearoa New
important because...                          Zealand will be impacted by climate change. We need to take
                                              accountability for our actions by bringing awareness and action into

                                              our everyday lives, not just at protests. There needs to be leadership
                                              at a national level to take the actions necessary to mitigate climate
                                              change.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              The amazing mahi of Generation Zero in the creation of the Carbon
                                              Zero Act can put Aotearoa New Zealand on the map as a country
                                              that takes action on climate change, listens to their rangatahi and
                                              the need to pay heed to the long term well-being of the planet.
