A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is
important because...                         it's almost too late.

Long-term target                             I believe that the target of reducing total greenhouse gases to net
                                             zero by 2050 is not strong enough. There is no reason why a

                                             wealthy, developed nation cannot achieve this by 2030. We have to
                                             act boldly and we have to act now.

                                             I support taking a science-based approach to ensure our efforts to
                                             eliminate emissions are as impactful as possible: we should aim for

                                             negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases
                                             to sustainable levels.

                                             This target should be reached by reducing our own emissions and
                                             not by using international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
