A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Every individual, every business, every instituition and every
important because...                         government department urgently needs to reduce our carbon
                                             footprint. Better still, take it into negative. We have had the chance

                                             to voluntarily reduce our footprints and no overall sizable reduction
                                             has been achieved. We cant do it without legislation.

Long-term target                             I am in complete favour of reducing NZ's greenhouse gases to net
                                             zero by 2050. This target should be achieved by bringing down our
                                             own emissions levels and not by purchasing carbon credits. Where
                                             long-lived gases are concerned, we should go beyond just neutral

                                             and aim for negative levels.
Climate Commission                           An independent Climate Commission should be established. It should

                                             be run by experts, as an advisory body.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
