A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is The state of our planet's climate is going to affect everybody
important because...                          eventually, and the most vulnerable of us first. We can't afford to
                                              lose more than we already have, to extinction, to industrialisation, to

                                              greed, to 'growth'. Action is already fifty-odd years in the slow and
                                              painful making, let's not waste any more time!! This is our future, our
                                              children's future.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should absolutely be reached by reducing our OWN emissions and
                                              not by using international carbon credits (which ultimately do not
                                              engender the difference that we need).

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
