A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Without it our climate will get progressively more chaotic.
important because...                           Environmental and social change will occur at an increasing rate with
                                               consequent disruption to communities, to animal and plant species,

                                               to the people who depend on them.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.
                                               While I consider zero carbon to be urgent, we must make individual
                                               commitments about how we will change our behaviour. The Act

                                               needs to be adhered to from a personal belief and intention if it is to
                                               work. I believe a strategy to bring the will of the people along with
                                               the law makers should be part of the Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               Change on the scale necessary to achieve zero carbon will be
                                               challenging and costly on many levels. The outcome of not changing

                                               could disastrous for people still to be born. That is immoral.
