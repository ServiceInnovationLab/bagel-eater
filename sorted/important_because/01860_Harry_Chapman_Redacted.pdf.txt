A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I think climate change is the most important issue facing NZ and the
important because...                         world. We need this law to set in stone the need to deal with climate
                                             change, and provide everyone with certainty about where we need

                                             to get to.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050.

                                             Even those gases which have short lives are generally potent, and
                                             we need to avoid reaching tipping points in the short term. all gases

                                             matter in the short term.
Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
