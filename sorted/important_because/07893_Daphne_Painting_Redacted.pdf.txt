A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We need to do everything within our means to prevent pollution in
important because...                           our very beautiful country.
                                               NZ has in the past been very clean but has gradually deteriorated.

                                               River water is widely
                                               suspect; The stars are no longer visible from the cities and light and
                                               petrol pollution are
                                               everywhere.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               This effects marine and avian life so deeply. Heating the sea means
                                               that marine food moves
                                               to lower levels and the pelagic feeding birds find trouble in diving
                                               down to catch their food.
