A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Our planet cannot cope with the amount of carbon and other
important because...                          pollution being inflicted upon it at current rates. It is vital for the
                                              survival of future generations and for the survival of our natural

                                              environment that drastic changes are made to the way we live our
                                              lives and consume resources. Please act now to make these
                                              changes, our planet and the lives of future generations depend on it.
                                              This is a chance for Aotearoa to be a world leader and an inspiration
                                              for other countries.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                              international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              Please seize this opportunity and bring about the change we urgently
                                              need.
