A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is The Zero carbon Act is needed because climate disruption effects will
important because...                         have enormous political, economic and social effects and therefore is
                                             the biggest challenge facing humans today.

Long-term target                             I dont support the target of reducing total greenhouse gases to net

                                             zero by 2050 because it is insufficiently ambitious.
Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice.
                                             I also support taking a science-based approach, rather than a non-
                                             scientific but politically popular approach.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair sothat it does not allow NZ
                                             to ignore and continue its past contributions to climate disruption,
                                             which are an enormous imposition of 3rd World peoples who have

                                             contributed far less to climate disruption but are far less able to
                                             mitigate its effects on themselves.
