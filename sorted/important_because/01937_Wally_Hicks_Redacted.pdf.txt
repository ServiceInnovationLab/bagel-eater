A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is If we carry on how we are, we'll leave a catastrophe for our
important because...                           mokopuna, rather than a beautiful country in a potentially beautiful,
                                               peaceful world. Something dying instead of something living and

                                               giving of life. We need to stop raping Mother Earth for resources and
                                               cease our dependence on our ancestor Ancient Sunshine's fossil
                                               fuels. I want Aotearoa New Zealand to lead the way in creating
                                               alternatives which support thrival.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
