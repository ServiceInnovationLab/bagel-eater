A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We need to preserve the environment for current and future
important because...                          generations. Effects of global warming are already impacting
                                              thousands of peoples lives. This issue needs to be taken seriously by

                                              every single person in order for us to have any chance of preventing
                                              disastrous weather events in the near future. The government
                                              getting behind the zero carbon act is the first step for everybody to
                                              take the issue more seriously.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              I object to my name being released to the public in association with
                                              any of the above information. I wish to remain anonymous.
