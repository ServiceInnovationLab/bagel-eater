A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is The economies that are the most prepared for new industries and
important because...                          have spread the costs over the longest time will be the most
                                              successful in future. There are plenty of examples including

                                              Germany’s solar, Denmark’s wind, battery companies and when New
                                              Zealand has invested for the future with hydro and geothermal, it
                                              has unlocked potential for other industries. This is an opportunity
                                              and it will be too late when the necessary changes are clear. This
                                              could be the testing ground for the latest solutions bringing nz to the

                                              forefront of technology and reverse the negative association with the
                                              necessary change to current lifestyle.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
Further comments                              The main changes needed are from ice engines to electric as per

                                              Tesla, increase of electricity from 80 to 100% renewables, of which
                                              wind and solar can easily meet with continued population growth.
