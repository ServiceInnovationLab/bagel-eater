A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Businesses and related enterprises are notoriously unable to self
important because...                          police - it is the exception not the rule. An intelligent, fair and well
                                              researched law to minimise carbon use and waste gives New

                                              Zealand a chance to make the transition to an energy efficient and
                                              sustainable society.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I support a science-based approach that
                                              acknowledges and employs rapidly growing energy efficiency
                                              industries and alternative energy generation technology that will

                                              reduce our carbon footprint and create wealth by developing
                                              solutions and helping people save money. Targets should be reached
                                              by reducing our own emissions and not by using international carbon
                                              credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts who provide advice, and has a say in New
                                              Zealand government funding of carbon reduction solutions.

Adaptation                                    I support a draft plan for adaptation being included in the Zero

                                              Carbon Act. There should be public input as part of the draft plan
                                              creation.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              The framing of a Zero Carbon Act would gain more by a positive,
                                              community supportive outlook and philosophy. A simply punitive
                                              approach that only looks to slap down carbon use will not inspire

                                              change or bring people on board. The bigger picture is that a
                                              transition to an zero carbon goal is a wealth-creating opportunity:
                                              new jobs, new products, new pride in creating a better future. This
                                              journey affects everyone in New Zealand and potentially everyone
                                              can be a lot better off.
