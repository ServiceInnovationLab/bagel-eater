A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I need to know New Zealand is doing everything possible to help the
important because...                          environment for the benefit of my 3 year old son, his future family
                                              and so on. As populations increase the more important it is to

                                              educate new generations in the ways of living with a minimal/zero
                                              carbon footprint, and to re-educate parents and grandparents. A new
                                              zero carbon way of living has to adopted by everyone!

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              Along with individuals, there are too many businesses who haven't
                                              adopted good environmental practices and aren't doing there bit due
                                              to the bottom line. Green energy and waste practices need to be
                                              encouraged, in some cases enforced, but also subsidised to help get
                                              everyone on same page.
