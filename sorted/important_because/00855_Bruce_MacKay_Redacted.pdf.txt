A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is New Zealand is far behind other 1st world countries in taking a
important because...                          responsible approach to climate change. New Zealand should be
                                              ahead of the game.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                              international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              The Act should be combined with measures that foster a move away
                                              from private to public transport, from road to rail for heavy industrial
                                              transport needs, and from diesel use to electric vehicles and trains.
