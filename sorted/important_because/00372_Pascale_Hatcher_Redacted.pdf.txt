A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is 1) A firm legislation goes beyond good intention
important because...                         2) NZ should be a (world) leader on this issue
                                             3) We need to think of future generations

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                             gases to net zero much earlier than 2050.

                                             I also support taking a science-based approach to ensure our efforts
                                             to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible: we should aim for
                                             negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases

                                             to below sustainable levels. This target should be reached by
                                             reducing our own emissions and not by using international carbon
                                             credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, and: that will
                                             "strongly" influence final decisions from our government.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
Further comments                             To do this, important decisions must be made to transition away

                                             from our high intensity and fast expansion of the dairy sector.
