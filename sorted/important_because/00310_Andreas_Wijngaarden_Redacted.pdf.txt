 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is The world is changing so we need to change too. I'm concerned
 important because...                          about Climate Change especially due to the crazy ocean acidification
                                               issues. We do so much farming in our waters and as of yet have not

                                               cared about how we are affecting it, and the consequences for us will
                                               be substantial. Oceans are a part of the beautiful essence of
                                               Aotearoa and the least we can do is give a damn about it in return. I
                                               think the Zero Carbon Act is important in taking these much needed
                                               steps in order to make a better future.

 Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                               international carbon credits.
 Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

 Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

 Further comments                              Even though we don't produce as much Methane, we still have a big
                                               footprint for that too. Zero Methane Act? Methane is said to be
                                               around 19 times more harmful to our environment and atmosphere

                                               and unlike Carbon, Methane isn't absorbed or used by the millions of
                                               plants we still have in NZ. Thank you for your time.
