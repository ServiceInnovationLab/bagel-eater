 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I believe the Zero Carbon Act is important to preserve the clean,
 important because...                          green ideology we boast about here in New Zealand. I want us to be
                                               a leading force in making a difference in climate change, and a law

                                               like this is how we get there.

 Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

 Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

 Further comments                              For years scientists have been claiming clean energy is a very real
                                               and obtainable possibility, but everyone has elected to put it in the

                                               too hard basket and wait for others to come along to fix it or ignore
                                               the problem altogether. This is no longer an option.
