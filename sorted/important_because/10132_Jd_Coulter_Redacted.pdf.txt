A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I am part of a generation that has publicly identified severe issues
important because...                          with our climate. For our parents it was an undiagnosed problem that
                                              may or not effect us. Now it is clear that for my children I must make

                                              a conscious effort to move from a post-industrial mindset of
                                              generations before, to one of inovation and change for the
                                              betterment of Humanity not just New Zealand. This I think starts with
                                              legislation that sparks and provokes change! There will be people
                                              opposed to change, but this isn’t about them it’s about generations

                                              to come and our responsibility to leave things better for them than
                                              has been left for us.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
