A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I'm worried about how global and local inaction on climate change
important because...                           will affect us here in New Zealand, now and for generations to come.
                                               I'm already seeing the effect of climate change on the homes of my

                                               family who live in a coastal low lying area. I would love for New
                                               Zealand to be a leader in climate change and take action now with a
                                               Zero Carbon Act rather than using international carbon credits. The
                                               sooner we act as a nation to reduce our emissions and switch to
                                               more climate-friendly technologies, the better placed we will be to

                                               deal with the changes climate change is bringing to the world.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
