A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Climate change is a problem that will affect everyone. The impacts
important because...                          are well documented and it comes down to a matter of ethics. If we
                                              do nothing will we honestly be able to look the future generation in

                                              the face and say that this was good enough? The only way that
                                              climate change can be tackled is by setting ambitious targets. This is
                                              only going to become more and more evident and there may be
                                              substantial benefits to leading from the front.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.
                                              It should be clear that offsetting emissions alone will not nearly be
                                              enough, there needs to be substantial reductions in emissions which
                                              will require some hard decisions to be made.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
Further comments                              The work on the zero carbon act should also be leveraged to

                                              investigate the benefits of transitioning away from the current
                                              emissions trading scheme and moving to a carbon tax.
