A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is A Zero Carbon Law helps us prepare for the future by prioritising the
important because...                           necessary changes, even if it is not the easiest way in short term.

Long-term target                               We need a challenging target and we will find ways to achieve. I
                                               support the target of reducing total greenhouse gases to net zero by

                                               2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to ensure our
                                               efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible: we should
                                               aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived
                                               gases to sustainable levels. This target should be reached by
                                               reducing our own emissions and not by using international carbon

                                               credits. We have a good track record in reducing lead in petrol and in
                                               healing ozone layer.

Climate Commission                             Lets find a bipartisan measure which is transparent. I support the
                                               establishment of an independent Climate Commission that is made
                                               up of experts and provides advice, but does not make final decisions.
                                               Any change from its recommendations should have to be
                                               documented and justified.

Adaptation                                     We are all in this together. Adaptation or changes will be for all of us

                                               though some will feel it much more strongly. Lets plan to share the
                                               burden. I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero
                                               Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                Gosh, what a great perspective to support the needs of all and
                                               ensure we can all have best futures. A Zero Carbon Act must be just
                                               and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o Waitangi; ensures a just

                                               transition for workers and communities; and avoids passing on the
                                               costs to future generations.

Further comments                               Please find a path we can broadly agree on and start supporting each
                                               other along.
