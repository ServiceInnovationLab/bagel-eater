A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is This is such an opportunity for NZ. We should be looking to the future
important because...                         and encouraging innovation and brilliance, working towards
                                             sustainable energy use, transport and food production. Addressing

                                             climate change is important for the continuing ability of the planet to
                                             support human life. Being ahead of the curve on innovation is also
                                             great for the economy in the medium term.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                             international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
