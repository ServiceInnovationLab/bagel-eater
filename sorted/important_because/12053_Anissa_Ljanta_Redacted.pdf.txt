A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I was one of the first people bringing awareness to Climate Change
important because...                          by protesting at COP1 in the nineties. I have been privy to more info
                                              that most about the effects of climate change. It's terrifying. Life on

                                              earth is at risk. Change has been too slow and we're seeing serious
                                              effects much earlier than we previously projected. Government
                                              needs to lead by climate law. Please do. I am a mother and looking
                                              into my child's future is scary. Our kids and the earth deserve better
                                              than that.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                              international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
