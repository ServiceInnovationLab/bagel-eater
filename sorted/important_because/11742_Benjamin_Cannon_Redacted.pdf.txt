A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Climate action on its own is at risk of becoming a political football,
important because...                          however if a law is in place the debate can turn to how to solve the
                                              issue, not if we solve it. Climate change is too big of a problem to

                                              solve in a three year election cycle.

                                              I am concerned that climate change will make the vulnerable people
                                              in society even more so, and everyday life for most of the world will
                                              become much more difficult if not impossible. This law is needed to

                                              help New Zealand take the steps toward a more stable and
                                              sustainable future.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
