A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is without goals, people have no focus so changes dont happen. Very
important because...                          few of us are proactive; we need to feel a sense of urgency, to see
                                              our polluted waters, to see the seas loaded with our rubbish & to

                                              keep getting the message that it is utterly urgent that every one of
                                              us must compromise now if we are to have a future that is worth
                                              fighting for.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              No government will make changes unless pushed by the voters.
                                              Being proactive now may mean a future with some quality remaining
