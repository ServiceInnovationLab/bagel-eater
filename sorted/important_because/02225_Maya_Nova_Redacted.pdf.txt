A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I personally feel that the climate change is the most defining
important because...                          problem of our time. Any progressive, smart and socially conscious
                                              government needs to take URGENT leadership on this matter. I am

                                              very proud of the steps our current government is making towards a
                                              more progressive and equitable society, and I urge you to please
                                              take a courageous and bold stance with the Zero Carbon Act. The
                                              future will remember you and thanks you.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              Let our small ingenious country lead the way towards a susttainale
                                              future for all!!
