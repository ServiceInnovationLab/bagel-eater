A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is As a Teacher I am on the front line for watching our next generation
important because...                          of New Zealand citizens grow and learn. The amount of potential and
                                              enthusiasm for our future in every student I see is incredible. It is up

                                              to us NOW to put in place changes and ideas that can create
                                              solutions for the dearth of problems that we have all inherited from
                                              the past 200 years of poor decisions. We need to pass this now to
                                              ensure we are protecting our future.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
