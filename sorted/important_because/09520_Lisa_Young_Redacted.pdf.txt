A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is the environment is very important to look after. There continues to
important because...                          be major melting in the Antarctic and Arctic continents, the sea level
                                              is continuing to rise, and there continues to be extreme weather

                                              events (flooding, fires, very high weather temperatures, severe sand
                                              erosion, islands will cease to be) that are having disastrous effects
                                              on human life and the environment. We can't just sit back and let the
                                              damage continue to happen!

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
