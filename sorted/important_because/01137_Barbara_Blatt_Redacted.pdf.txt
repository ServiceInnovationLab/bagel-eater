A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is humans are not the owners of this planet. We are 'guests', and if we
important because...                          want to be here for little longer, in the best conditions possible, we
                                              better start working on preserving/improving everything and

                                              anything that has to do with our environment. Starting NOW.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero, at the very latest by 2050. I also support taking a
                                              science-based approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions
                                              are as impactful as possible: we should aim for negative levels of
                                              long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable

                                              levels. This target should be reached by reducing our own emissions
                                              and not by using international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
