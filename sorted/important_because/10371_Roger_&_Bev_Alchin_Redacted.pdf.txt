A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is
important because...                         for the sake of all the young people who will and are following.

Long-term target                             We support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. We also support taking a science-based

                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions have as much
                                             impact as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived
                                             gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This
                                             target should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by
                                             using international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                           We support the establishment of an independent Climate
                                             Commission that is made up of experts and provides advice, but

                                             does not make final decisions.

Adaptation                                   We support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon
                                             Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                             This action can not be delayed any longer. We must act now!
