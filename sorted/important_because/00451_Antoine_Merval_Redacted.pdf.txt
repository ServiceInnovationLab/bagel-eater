 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is climate change is already happening and will without a doubt impact
 important because...                          the way we and our children will live. We have to do everything we
                                               can to prevent further damage to the planet.

                                               New Zealand has a great potential as a country to make a Zero
                                               Carbon economy a reality and should take this opportunity.

 Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and developing
                                               potential carbon sinking technologies and not by using international
                                               carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

 Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

 Further comments                              To be effective, a Zero Act bill should enforce by law ambitious
                                               target of green house gases emission reduction if possible going
                                               further and faster than the ones set by the Paris Agreement. At the
                                               very least, it has to ensure that New Zealand will respect the targets
                                               and objective it has agreed to in this agreement.

                                               The government should lead the way in transforming the way it
                                               works and operate and enforce the respect by businesses and
                                               companies, even foreign, to abide to an environmental regulation to
                                               be put in place.
                                               The bill should regulate, prepare and enforce the transformation

                                               needed in the domains of transport, farming and energy
                                               consumption.
