A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is as responsible global citizens we play our part and in particular we
important because...                           act in solidarity with our neighbours in the pacific islands suffering
                                               more than us from sea level rise

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                               international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               There is an urgency before us all to care for our common home, for
                                               us to join with the tangata whenua and all peoples of the world who
                                               view life as a gift to be reverenced and lived in harmony with, we

                                               acknowledge the slow and intricate unfolding of biological life, we
                                               view ourselves as a special awareness in this great unfolding and we
                                               endeavour in all our activities to be present to all life in a manner
                                               that is mutually beneficial. This is a time of a great transition from
                                               growth and consumption to a life sustaining society, this transition

                                               changes everything to do with our identities and roles that we have
                                               taken for granted up until now.
