A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Climate change is the most depressing thing in my life right now. The
important because...                           prospect I foresee for the future of my 3 children and their children I
                                               feel is bleak and I really feel this planet is doomed to a serious

                                               escalation of the 6th mass extinction that has begun. The zero
                                               carbon act will show that we take this existential threat seriously and
                                               are ambitious to make the changes needed to do our bit to fight this.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

                                               The sad fact is that even if NZ does an impressive about turn on our
                                               carbon emissions, the world as a whole will likely tip the global
                                               environment further into crisis and put our survival in real jeopardy.
                                               We will need adapta1 plans even as we exceed the best mitigation
                                               goals.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               We're doomed. As part of our adaptation measures, we should
