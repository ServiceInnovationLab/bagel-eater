A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I personally feel that NZ has not made as much of an effort as we
important because...                         should have in terms of protecting our climate. The Zero Carbon act
                                             would be a big step that shows that we care as a country about our

                                             earth, by starting to make some good changes to the current norm.
                                             Climate change is harming our ecosystems, and it is about time we
                                             start taking that seriously and change the way we operate to
                                             acknowledge the many current destructive human practices.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                             international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                             It is so important for us to start making bigger changes towards a
                                             smarter future.
