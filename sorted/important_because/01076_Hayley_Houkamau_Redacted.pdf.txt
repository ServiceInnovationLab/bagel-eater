A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We already face challenging climates and weather patterns that are
important because...                         creating big problems in NZ. Science has shown that carbon and
                                             other gases are a contributory factor. People in parliament are in the

                                             position power wise and intellectually, to make good policy and
                                             decisions that help the environment and the safety of citizens.
                                             Money is not the only important thing therefore action needs to
                                             come via policy so people and new economies can flourish in ways
                                             that support the environment and future generations. This

                                             information has been accessible for a long time thus action needs to
                                             ramp up asap.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050 I also support taking a science-based
                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                             international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
