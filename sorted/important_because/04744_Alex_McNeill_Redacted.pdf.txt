A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is It's vital that NZ mitigates climate change as much as still possible,
important because...                           as fast as possible. Furthermore, we must adapt to a world that will
                                               eventuate whether we're prepared or not. I love our country and

                                               believe that our economy must be prepared. I personally take
                                               measures to reduce my personal carbon footprint - cycling, bussing,
                                               not eating animal products, etc. - but deep down I know that I can't
                                               bring about change by myself. This change has got to come from
                                               Govt - regardless of who is in power. I hope the Bill will help

                                               transition our country into what it needs to be to ensure safe,
                                               healthy, economically strong communities in the decades and
                                               centuries to come.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
