A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is In 2017 we entered the age of Generation Zero. This new era
important because...                           signifies that we have run out of time to prevent a 2 - 4 degree
                                               increase in our world's climate. I believe we're in for increasingly

                                               extreme and unimaginable weather events ahead. We're at the
                                               brink. We need to do everything in our power not to make it worse.
                                               For this reason:

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of scientific experts and provides advice, but does
                                               not make final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               It's extremely important that the Zero Carbon Act is passed. New
                                               Zealand may be a small country, but we are still significant polluters
                                               of our environment. We need to actively legislate to change this. We
                                               should have got onto this years ago, but better late than never!
