A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is A human beings we are the only species on Earth who do not renew
important because...                           the elements of life - air, water, soil and energy. I believe the effects
                                               of climate change are helping us as a species to understand this. A

                                               climate law like the Zero Carbon Act will enable all of us to feel the
                                               power of doing this with the whole population for our survival but
                                               especially for all species.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
