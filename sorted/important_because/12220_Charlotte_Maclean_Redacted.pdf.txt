A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We need to be resilient to changes that are already going to happen,
important because...                          and be ambitious in investing in a carbon zero future

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              The goal should be 2040 to achieve carbon zero and should include
                                              agriculture.
                                              We must look at resilience not only for NZ citizens but our Pacific
                                              Island neighbours.

                                              We have an opportunity to invest not only in a clean, carbon zero
                                              future, but also in a fast growing renewables market.
                                              Better infrastructure for electric transportation will be vital and
                                              incentives for people to switch to electric vehicles and carbon zero
