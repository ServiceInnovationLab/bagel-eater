A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is we can no longer carry on as normal, in a state of denial about the
important because...                         destruction of our environment.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. It is urgent now that we stop talking and

                                             take concrete, immediate and effective action.

                                             I also support taking a science-based approach to ensure our efforts
                                             to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible: we should aim for
                                             negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases

                                             to sustainable levels. This target should be reached by reducing our
                                             own emissions and not by using international carbon credits (which
                                             have already been proven to have little positive impact).

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
