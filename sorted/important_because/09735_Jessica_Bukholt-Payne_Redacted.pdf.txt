A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We need to take responsibility for actions, both on our behalf and the
important because...                          behalf of places and people in the world affected by climate change
                                              but without as many resources to impact carbon emissions.

                                              Individual change is not enough. We need serious planning and
                                              infrastructure in place to create a New Zealand that not only reduces
                                              its damage to the environment, but hopefully makes positive
                                              contributions too.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
