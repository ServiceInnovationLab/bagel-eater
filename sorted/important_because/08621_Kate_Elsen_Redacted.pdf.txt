A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Because its the right ,fair and just thing to do for our future
important because...                          generations if we are to mitigate the effects of Climate change and
                                              without an Act there are too many businesses and people who will

                                              not willingly make the necessary sacrifices unless there is
                                              enforceable robust legislation.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
Further comments                              I admire the millennials who have tirelessly done the ground work

                                              ,written devised and insisted that we persevere and pass this Act
