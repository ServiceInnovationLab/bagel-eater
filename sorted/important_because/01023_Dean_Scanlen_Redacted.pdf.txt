A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Climate change is the biggest threat to our existence and we must
important because...                           all play our part in combatting it.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050 as this is much more likely to ensure that

                                               carbon-intensive industries like agriculture do not continue being
                                               subsidised by others. I also support taking a science-based approach
                                               to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions have as much impact as
                                               possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while
                                               reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. It is very important

                                               that this target be reached by reducing our own emissions and not
                                               by using international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I strongly support the establishment of a politically independent
                                               Climate Commission that is made up of experts in the various fields
                                               that are vital to achieving the zero-carbon goal; has a clear terms of
                                               reference that includes advice about regulation and financial
                                               contribution from Government towards the goal; and has cross-party

                                               support.

Adaptation                                     I support a national plan for adaptation being included in the Zero
                                               Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities;
                                               ensures that poor people and future generations do not bear a
                                               disproportionate share of the cost of achieving carbon neutrality.

Further comments                               Thank you for the opportunity to finally put in place measures that
                                               are likely to make a significant difference to our shameful record on

                                               greenhouse pollution.
