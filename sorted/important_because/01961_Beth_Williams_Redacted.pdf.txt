A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is The zero carbon act is important to me because it will affect the
important because...                          world which my childrenâ€™s and their children will live in. I believe that
                                              we all have the right to life in a safe and inhabitable world and the

                                              zero carbon act is the only way to achieve that!

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              PLEASE GET THIS DONE SO MY CHILDREN CAN LEAVE IN A GREEN
                                              AND BREATHABLE WORLD!!!!
