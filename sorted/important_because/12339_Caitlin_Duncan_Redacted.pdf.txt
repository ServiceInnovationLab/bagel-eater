A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I want my children to have a future, and they wont if we keep
important because...                         destroying our climate the way we have been for decades. I want
                                             humans to stop destroying the climate which every other species on

                                             earth depends on. We need to take action now, and it's pathetic that
                                             more hasn't already been done.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                             international carbon credits.

                                             Carbon credits are not good enough!

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
