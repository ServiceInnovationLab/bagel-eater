A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is A healthy environment means healthy people. Human wellbeing is
important because...                          dependent on healthy ecosystems and biodiversity. Climate change
                                              threatens this with species extinction, environmental refugees,

                                              ocean acidification too name a few. Whether people support it or not,
                                              serious things will have to be done to minimise climate change in
                                              order to survive/live a fulfilled life where future generations can
                                              enjoy the environment. So the early we start the better, because
                                              action is going to be inevitable. Take the world stage NZ! Like

                                              women voting and anti nuclear stance. Live up to being clean and
                                              green.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
