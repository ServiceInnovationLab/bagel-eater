A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We all share this planet and global warming is borderless. We need
important because...                         to act strong and create a brighter future for generations to come.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. New zealand can lead the charge by using

                                             our location, innovation, mindset, and amazing nature as a tool to
                                             leverage and inspire other nations to do the same. Imaging the
                                             future. Green, lush and modern.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice. I also want to see
                                             the commission control some funds so it can inject investment into
                                             targeted projects to support a sustainable future.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                             New Zealand will greatly benefit by leading the charge. It will make
                                             our contry flourish with new technology, tourists, and citizens that
                                             care for the future.
