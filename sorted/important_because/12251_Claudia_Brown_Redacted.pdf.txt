A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is It gives us the chance for our children to see NEW Zealand as we
important because...                          once saw it, as well as feeling like they have a chance to also bring
                                              up generations in a safe environment


                                              Reducing greenhouse gases through the zero carbon act is a step in
                                              the right direction for New Zealand as we have people believing that
                                              its not there problem and that they can do nothing about it. For
                                              those who do care and are aware of the impacts these gases are

                                              having on our planet have the change to make a change for NZ and
                                              make others realise how important it is to make changes in everyday
                                              life but also standing up for laws in NZ to help our environment,
                                              keeping it beautiful.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
