A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I will bring our economy into the future where we can grow healthy
important because...                           people and good jobs while not killing the planet or drowning our
                                               Pacific neighbors,

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                               international carbon credits.

                                               Developing our own ability to lower emissions is vital to our economy
                                               long term and simply sending guilt money overseas should not be an
                                               option.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, and is empowered to

                                               make final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.
                                               This should include refuge status to our pacific neighbors in a
                                               structured long term manner so our culture and theirs can adapt
                                               over a reasonable and gradual time period rather than waiting for
                                               extensive flooding and a big rush of folks.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               The world is going to be forced to adapt and this is our best chance
                                               to assist the world in lessening the changes and adapting our
                                               economy so that NZ is resilient to these changes.
