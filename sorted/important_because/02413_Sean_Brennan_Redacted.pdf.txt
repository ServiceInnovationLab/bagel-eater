A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Climate change is presently the most pressing environmental, social
important because...                          and economic issue. A robust, cross-partisan statute setting
                                              ambitious (but achievable) goals is absolutely necessary.The Zero

                                              Carbon Act's modelling upon its United Kingdom counterpart is
                                              sound, but some changes to cater particularly for New Zealand's
                                              social and economic context is necessary too. I elaborate briefly
                                              below.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
