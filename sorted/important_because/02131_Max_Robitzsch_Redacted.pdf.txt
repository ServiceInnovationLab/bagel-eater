A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I believe that we should be having a zero carbon law because
important because...                        otherwise, dealing with climate change will only get more difficult.

Long-term target                            Reducing total greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050 should be the
                                            absolute minimum. We should achieve this without carbon credit

                                            trading internationally (zeroing within NZ).
Climate Commission                          A Climate Commission to advise the government independently

                                            would be useful.

Adaptation                                  I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                             A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                            Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                            avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
