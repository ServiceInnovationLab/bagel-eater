A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is because it effects our future generations, I want the next generation
important because...                           to feel like we really stuck up for their them and our beautiful
                                               country and not feel let down by a lot of our elders in regards to the

                                               way they've contributed to climate change and discussion around it -
                                               which is how I feel as a young New Zealander. I want to be proud to
                                               be from New Zealand and I think we have the potential to be a world
                                               leader when it comes to climate change. It is a chance to make a
                                               difference before it is too late.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                               international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
