A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is
important because...                          I worry for our future generations, let's lead by example now.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2040. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of industry experts and leading researchers, which

                                              helps make informed and calculated final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              Let's see a strong government proposal to increase the use of hybrid,
                                              electric and low emission vehicles, that benefits all citizens, not just
                                              the wealthy.
