A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Due to increases in CO2 levels from 350 parts per million to over 400
important because...                           ppm is taking us towards disaster.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               The production of Pulp paper worldwide is the third largest single
                                               contributor to air/water and solid waste pollution. e.g. 5 billion tonnes
                                               CO2 plus airborne and water borne toxins, 30 million gallons each of
                                               chlorine and sulphuric acid ends up in oceans. Planting high density

                                               forests("green deserts") only harbour 8% of the natural
                                               wildlife(insects, plants, birds and animals that a native forest holds.
