A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I want my future kids to grow up with better air quality. I cycle to
important because...                         work and have to inhale copious amounts of carbon monoxide every
                                             day just to get to work and make a living. I am not sure if people

                                             understand how bad the air quality can be around public spaces,
                                             schools etc that aren't even that densely populated. There are
                                             alternatives to such a high amount of automobile use but there
                                             needs to be support from government to aid the transition.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                             international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
