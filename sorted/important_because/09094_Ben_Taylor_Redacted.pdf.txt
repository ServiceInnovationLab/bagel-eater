A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I want the most robust Zero Carbon Act we can form in order to deal
important because...                         with our impact on climate change. I want an act that ensures that
                                             businesses and corporate interests must comply and contribute to

                                             the aims in reducing our impact on climate change. The sooner we
                                             act as a nation to reduce our emissions and switch to more climate-
                                             friendly technologies, the better placed we will be to deal with the
                                             changes climate change is bringing to the world.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                             international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
