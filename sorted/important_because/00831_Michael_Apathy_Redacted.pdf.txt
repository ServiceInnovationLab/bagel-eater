A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Climate change is the overarching existential threat to the human
important because...                          race, but also most of the animals and plants on our planet. I feel this
                                              very deeply the major moral and practical obligation that we have to

                                              ourselves, our communities, and future generations. We need an act
                                              that is clear and strong and courageous to help tackle the immense
                                              challenge of climate change, and we cannot leave this to individual
                                              consciences or the market.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits. It is crucial that all areas be considered,

                                              including air travel and agriculture.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations. Just transition as a
                                              concept should not be used to delay significant action on climate

                                              change.
