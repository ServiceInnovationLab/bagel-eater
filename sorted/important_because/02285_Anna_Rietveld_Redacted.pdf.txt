A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I want future generations to grow up in a world that isn't completely
important because...                          devestated by the effects of climate change. The human impact on
                                              this planet is huge and while any small efforts toward reducing our

                                              carbon footprint make a difference in the long term, the rate at
                                              which the earth is deteriorating is too fast for such gradual change. A
                                              major step needs to be taken in order to make a significant
                                              difference and climate laws can do this. Please please help make a
                                              change!!

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                              international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
