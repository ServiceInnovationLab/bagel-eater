A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is If we do not have healthy ecosystems and healthy climates, then any
important because...                          conversations around healthy economies will be academic - as we
                                              may not be around for much longer! These topics cannot be ignored

                                              any longer. We all know this.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              I support adherence to, and recognition of, the SDGs, and believe NZ
                                              has an obligation to support best practice development for our

                                              future. We cannot afford to rest on any laurels. We are lucky in this
                                              country but need, now, to take care of it - one and all.
