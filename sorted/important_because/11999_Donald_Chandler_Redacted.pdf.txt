A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We need to leave Earth in not just habitable, but excellent, condition
important because...                          for future generations. There simply isn't any alternative planet if
                                              this one gets wrecked.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                              international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              This is a must do. But it's also a can do. Not even close to impossible.
                                              In fact, I believe it will create opportunities, benefits, and wealth far
                                              in excess of its costs. Conversely, I believe the cost of failing to act

                                              boldly will be incalculably huge.
