A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is The Gvnt has to take the lead in supporting all New Zealanders to
important because...                          reduce our carbon footprint. It can't just be left to responsible
                                              individuals. We have a duty to proceeding generations to legislate

                                              now to ensure the survival of a healthy planet.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              We must all work hard to get cross-party support for the legislation
                                              so that it is lasting and binding
