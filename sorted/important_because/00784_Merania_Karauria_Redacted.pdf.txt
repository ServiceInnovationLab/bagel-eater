A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We are on the tipping point of ongoing extreme weather events. The
important because...                          Government must step up to enact this Act into law in line with the
                                              Paris Accord. The Zero Carbon Act must include all farming, industry

                                              and commerce; anything less is unacceptable.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero immediately. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair and avoids passing on the
                                              costs to future generations.

Further comments                              Climate change is the single most significant and pressing global
                                              challenge facing us.
                                              I believe any action will not be enough.
