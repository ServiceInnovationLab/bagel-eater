A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Future generations of my family and others depend on us to allow
important because...                          them the opportunity to have what we have had and are quickly
                                              losing, a world free from the effects of excess carbon.


                                              As i understand it GDP is currently measured on growth and growth
                                              alone. I say why be measured by this when it is clearly unsustainable
                                              for anything to keep 'growing' expinecially. Most things that do that
                                              either die or go boom! We need to be sustaible in all that we do for

                                              the good of all people and the good of our country's , as well as the
                                              world economy.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
