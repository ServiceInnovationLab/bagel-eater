 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We need the world to survive. It is clear human beings are upseting
 important because...                           "natures balance" or as a Jew one would say "JHWH's balanced

 Long-term target                               I support the target of reducing total greenhouse gases to net zero
                                                by 2050.I think that date is too far away. it shoud be 2040. Taking a

                                                are effective is critical. We should aim for negative levels of long-
                                                lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

                                                This target must be reached by reducing our own emissions.The use

 Climate Commission                             I consider the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                                made up of experts and providing advice is worthy of consideration.,

 Adaptation                                     I could support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero
