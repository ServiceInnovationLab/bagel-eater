 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We are in a climate emergency right now. Our global atmospheric
 important because...                          CO2 levels are out of control. We must get them down quickly. A
                                               similar UK law has seen reducing emissions there. We need a similar

                                               law enacted here in NZ--and quickly.

 Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by at the latest 2050. I also support taking a
                                               science-based approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions
                                               are as impactful as possible: we should aim for negative levels of
                                               long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable

                                               levels. This target should be reached by reducing our own emissions
                                               and not by using international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice.

 Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
