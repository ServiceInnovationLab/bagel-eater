 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is The need is urgent. NZ is dragging the chain instead of being at the
 important because...                          forefront of this movement.

 Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as effective
                                               as possible: We should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits which in my mind is only shifting the

                                               responsibility while not actually reducing greenhouse gases "See
                                               we've done the right thing so you can pollute more."

 Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

 Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

 Further comments                              Apart from the threat of nuclear war, I feel this is the most serious
                                               problem humanity has faced. It will affect every living thing, flora,

                                               fauna and humanity itself.
