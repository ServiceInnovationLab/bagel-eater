A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Peoples' lives and animals' lives depend on this. I don't consider it an
important because...                           option not to take an aggressive stance on climate change.
                                               Achieving a sustainable climate and reducing carbon levels in the

                                               atmosphere is absolutely necessary to prevent devastation across
                                               the world. Civilians across the world will be harmed by climate
                                               change, however the impact is not often felt by the polluters - so
                                               market forces cannot be relied on to "adjust" the position.
                                               Government regulation is required to address climate change. Low

                                               lying island countries are likely to suffer the worst if carbon levels
                                               are not aggressively reduced, which will cause massive crisis, and
                                               which personally devastates me because these countries have
                                               probably contributed the least to the cause of climate change.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               Let's do this.
