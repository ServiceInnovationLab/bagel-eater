A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is it means that some notice is being finally taken by the politicians of
important because...                           the science and warnings being made for the last 25 years. It is time
                                               they did something to organise for our society to start reducing our

                                               contribution to climate change rather than ignore the problem and
                                               let our carbon contribution to climate change increase which has
                                               happened over the last 25 years.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               The longer we restrain ourselves from doing anything the more likely
                                               we will fail to reach even the 2050 target of zero carbon emissions. I
                                               also think greater urgency could be made by properly and safely
                                               organising ourselves to achieve 'zero carbon' by 2040. After all, if
                                               this was about our political survival all stops would be pulled and the

                                               military would be given all the resources to ensure our political
                                               survival. It is time our society be given all the resources to increase
                                               the chances of our societal survival by stopping anthropogenic
                                               carbon reaching the atmosphere and then working to ensure it is
                                               reduced to 350 parts per million.
