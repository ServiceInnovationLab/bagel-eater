A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is It will be such a massive source of pride for us as Kiwis. Many of my
important because...                          friends are in different countries and I’ll feel so proud being able to
                                              share the news of a Zero Carbon Act with them.

Long-term target                              I definitely support the most ambitious target of reducing total

                                              greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050. We will need a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible. We should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                              international carbon credits!
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

                                              so close to becoming reality!
