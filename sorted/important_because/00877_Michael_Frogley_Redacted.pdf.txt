A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We can't continue polluting the environment as we are today, we
important because...                          must strive to correct the damage we have done or we risk loosing
                                              countless animal, plant, insect species and the land they live on. We

                                              need to be ahead of the movement, showing the world what can be
                                              done. We are a small country which should make it easier for New
                                              Zealand, but a country with a huge reputation. We need to do this
                                              now and not leave it for our children to try and clean up and correct
                                              when it's too late.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                              international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
