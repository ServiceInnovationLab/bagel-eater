 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Strong, binding legislation is need to tackle one of the greatest
 important because...                          threats to every living thing on this planet. The Zero Carbon Act not
                                               only sets into motion environmental safeguards, but makes total

                                               sense both socially and economically as the rest of the world enacts
                                               similar protocols.

 Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

 Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
 Further comments                              Generation Zero and our younger generations are the ones that will

                                               face the greater impacts of climate change, so listen to their calls
                                               rather than the persuasion of those generations that will not.
