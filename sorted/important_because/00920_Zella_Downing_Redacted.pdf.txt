A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is important because the
important because...                           future is important. It is time to accept the limitations of our current
                                               economic and energy models and embrace a future that provides an

                                               opportunity for our planetary systems to heal. By not taking decisive
                                               action to prevent or curb climate disruption, we are driving full speed
                                               into a brick wall, and that is insane.

                                               Humanity's potential, and our very survival, is being hampered by

                                               foolishly clinging to systems and practices that no longer serve us.
                                               It's time to grow into another way of being.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions have as big of an
                                               impact as possible. We should aim for negative levels of long-lived
                                               gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This
                                               target should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by
                                               using international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               It is imperative that we use our laws for the good of humanity and
                                               the planet itself. It is time our climate laws carry the wisdom needed
                                               to provide a secure future for the generations that are to come.
