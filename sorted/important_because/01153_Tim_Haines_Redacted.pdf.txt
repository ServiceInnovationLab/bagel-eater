A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is The environment is precious. I'm about to have a baby in 2 months
important because...                         and want to keep NZ looking beautiful. In the last couple of years,
                                             South Korea's skies have changed from blue to grey. Because of the

                                             pollution in the sky from neighbouring countries and their own,
                                             viewing distance is incresibly restricted. It is also very bad for the
                                             health of all the citizens living there and everyone has to wear
                                             masks. I would hate to see NZ become like that because we failed to
                                             act now

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                             international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an an independent Climate

                                             Commission that is made up of experts and provides advice, but
                                             does not make final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
