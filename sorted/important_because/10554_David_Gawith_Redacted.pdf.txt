A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I want to be proud of how we act as a country. On this issue of
important because...                          critical global importance we have underperformed for the last
                                              decade. The Zero Carbon Act forms part of what is needed to ensure

                                              that we do our fair share.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.
                                              Current GHG concentrations and levels of emissions mean that
                                              adaptation is inevitable. We must think strategically about how to

                                              adapt.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
