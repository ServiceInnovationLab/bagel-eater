A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is it represents the most important positive purpose for us to be alive
important because...                           at this particular time in human history.If we cannot solve this,the
                                               most pressing problem in human history...then we are setting

                                               ourselves up to have no further creation in any future history at
                                               all!!!This climate crisis is our final chance to prove that humans can
                                               serve others as well as we serve our own selves.....in fact can we be
                                               so unselfish as to deeply consider and even give up our own selfish
                                               desires in order to fight for the future welfare of humans who are not

                                               even born yet?

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
