A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Our current legislative framework does not do enough to reduce New
important because...                          Zealand's emissions and ensure that as a country we are acting as
                                              responsible global citizens. New Zealand has a reputation as a state

                                              that takes courageous steps to preserve and protect our natural
                                              environment. A zero carbon law is ambitious but serious ambition is
                                              necessary to tackle this problem and we need to lead by example.
                                              Future generations are depending on us.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
