A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We know that it is time to make changes to avoid a climate crisis.
important because...                          New Zealand needs to enact the Zero Carbon Bill to provide
                                              leadership for a workable solution for the future.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                              international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, and education, but
                                              does not make final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.
                                              Territorial Local Areas (City Councils. Regional Councils etc.,) need to
                                              play a key role in designing adaptation measures for their areas, to
                                              ensure that local issues are taken into account.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
