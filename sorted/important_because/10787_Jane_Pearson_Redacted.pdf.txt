A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is The time for action is right now to prevent long term global warming.
important because...                          I want my children to live on this beautiful planet surrounded by the
                                              flora and fauna that sustains us spiritually, environmentally and

                                              economically in Aotearoa. It is obvious that, for most of us, making
                                              the necessary changes and adjustments to our lifestyle requires a
                                              climate law like the Zero Carbon Act that means we have the best
                                              chance of reducing emissions to net zero by 2050.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
