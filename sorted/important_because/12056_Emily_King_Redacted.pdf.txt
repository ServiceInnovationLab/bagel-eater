A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We need to act now on mitigating our climate impacts and preparing
important because...                           for the effects of climate change. We need strong adaptation policies
                                               and laws for citizens and cities to follow in order to foster resilient

                                               communities and societies across Aotearoa. We also need to ensure
                                               vulnerable peoples such as elderly, poor and disabled are accounted
                                               for, along with Māori.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

                                               Without this the Act is pointless. We are already behind the rest of
                                               the world on adaptation work so it’s time to step up.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; takes into account te ao Maori; ensures a just transition for
                                               workers and communities; and avoids passing on the costs to future
                                               generations.

Further comments                               - we must address emissions from agriculture and provide low
                                               carbon land use incentives and alternatives for farmers.

                                               - air travel must be addressed
                                               - adaptation is critical
                                               - ensuring community based solutions are available
