A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We need a legal requirement to reach zero net carbon emissions
important because...                           because we have been really bad about actually doing anything to
                                               address climate change. It's a problem we have known about for

                                               literally decades now and not done anywhere near enough to
                                               effectively address it. There's always some short term excuse why
                                               it's "too soon" to do anything......yet the most recent science
                                               indicates our emissions to date are causing climate change to
                                               accelerate. This isn't a linear thing, it seems. It's compounding.


                                               It's critical we do our part. We are now seeing changes in real-time,
                                               year on year....which is extremely alarming on a planetary scale. The
                                               forces at play are now huge....and changing rapidly.


                                               It has to stop. We need this legislation to make it clear it MUST stop
                                               in NZ.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act,
                                               provided such a plan isn't used as an excuse to do nothing and

                                               assume we'll just adapt. Zero net carbon must always be the
                                               overriding goal.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               Please get this done. It's already very late.....
