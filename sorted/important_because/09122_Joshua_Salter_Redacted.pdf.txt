A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is The Zero Carbon Act is very important for signalling to New
important because...                           Zealanders and to the world the necessity for a more
                                               environmentally sustainable approach to running the country and

                                               individual lives. If we don't start NOW to reduce greenhouse gases
                                               the damage to our global climate may soon be irreversible.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.
                                               Even if zero emissions could be achieved immediately, the sea level

                                               rise and the extreme weather events will continue for years to come
                                               yet, so regional and national planning is needed to help communities
                                               adapt to these situations. Re-zoning of land - building regulations for
                                               houses built on stilts - there may be many different strategies for
                                               adapting - but they need to be underpinned by proper democratic

                                               decision-making processes.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
