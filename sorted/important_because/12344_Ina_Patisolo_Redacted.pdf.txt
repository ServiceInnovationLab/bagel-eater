A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Nz "joe blogs" can't be relied upon to do what's best for our
important because...                          environment. I entrust the government to do its job to make hard
                                              decisions in order to protect, maintain, restore, revive and live off

                                              our greatest asset - our land and sea, our environment, Aotearoa.
                                              Evidently, people are more concerned about lining their bins with
                                              "single"use, non-recyclable plastic bags than using sustainable
                                              alternatives. China has been plasric bag free since 2013. Samoa and
                                              Niue will be by 2019. COME ON NZ, what are we waiting for? Our

                                              delay is embarrassing. Ban plastic bags. We need these policies to
                                              come from the government.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
