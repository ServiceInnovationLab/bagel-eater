A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I hope my children will still be able to live their lives in my house
important because...                          which is 15 metres above sea level.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              I support full electrification of our rail network and expansion of the
                                              network for both high speed passenger transport and for getting
                                              freight off our narrow roads. Extension of the Wellington rail system
                                              to Wellington Airport would be a practical way of reducing carbon

                                              emmissions by politicians returning to their electorates by plane.
