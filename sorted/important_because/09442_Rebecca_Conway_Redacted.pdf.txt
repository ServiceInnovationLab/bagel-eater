A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We are currently running the earth to the ground. The way we are
important because...                          living is completely unsustainable and we should be investing our
                                              funding, time and effort into renewable energy resources. As one of

                                              the lesser populated countries in the world, with a new progressive
                                              government and a powerful leader such as Ardern, and our (currently
                                              misperceived) international reputation as a clean, green, natural
                                              country, Aotearoa New Zealand could become a world leader in
                                              sustainability paving the way for many pƒÅ harakeke to come. We

                                              have never known as much about the impact our current decisions
                                              are having on the earth as we do now, and it is therefore our
                                              responsibility to put that knowledge to good use.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
