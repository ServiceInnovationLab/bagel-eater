 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Implementation of law will ensure people are guided towards the
 important because...                         right path in NZ being more environmentally friendly. Its necessary
                                              to create change. Bring a citizen of NZ and the the globe, trying to

                                              minimise the impact of climate change is of paramount importance
                                              to me.

 Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

 Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
 Further comments                             We need to pass a law to stop sale of disposable plastic bags and

                                              containers in NZ. Its a simple step with massive benefits.
