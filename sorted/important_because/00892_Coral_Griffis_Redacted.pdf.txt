A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Life on earth will survive climate change, but humankind likely will
important because...                           not if we destabilise the life-support system to outside the
                                               parameters we need. Life on Earth will go on, but the loss of

                                               knowledge will be a tragedy if humans are reduced to scrabbling to
                                               survive in a hostile environment. I am a fleeting consciousness in the
                                               progress of Gaia and so are my children, but I still like to think we
                                               will go on to greater things, not die in our own shit!

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               I heard some guy on TV One breakfast talking about how we had to
                                               do a cost/benefit analysis of the cost of aiming for zero carbon, but I
                                               heard no mention of the cost of NOT taking action on climate
                                               change. Failure to make change will surely cost us a lot more!
