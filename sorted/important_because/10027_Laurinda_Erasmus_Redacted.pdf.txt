A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Severe changes in weather patterns with subsequent loss of habitat,
important because...                          plant species and diversity of animals. Also pollution levels in air, our
                                              water and the soil.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                              international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              Even small changes should be encouraged and made easy for any
                                              one to do. These will lead to greater awareness and larger steps to
                                              be taken. A test sample in one borough of London to switch to

                                              electric buses brought air pollution levels down within 24h of
                                              introducing these.
