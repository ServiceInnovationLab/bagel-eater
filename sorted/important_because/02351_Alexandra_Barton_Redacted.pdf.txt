A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is There are no second chances when it comes to climate change. New
important because...                         Zealandâ€™s unique environment is inherently valuable and deserves to
                                             be protected for future generations. As New Zealanders we have the

                                             privilege of a strong connection with the natural environment and it
                                             is therefore our responsibility to be world leaders on combating
                                             climate change.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                             international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
