A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is It is important because there are so many negative impacts climate
important because...                         change has on our planet and if we introduce the Zero Carbon Act it
                                             could help other countries and people understand the reality that it is

                                             real and it is an issue we must act on now!

Long-term target                             I support the target of reducing total greenhouse gases to net zero
                                             by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to ensure
                                             our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible: we
                                             should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                             short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target should be reached

                                             by reducing our own emissions and not by using international carbon
                                             credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
