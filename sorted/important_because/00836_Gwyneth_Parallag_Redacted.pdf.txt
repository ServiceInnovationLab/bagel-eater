A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is In recent years, youth all over the world have had to frustratingly sit
important because...                          back and watch adults make wrong decisions and pass great
                                              opportunities. This time, we are taking matters into our hands. We

                                              are not the leaders of tomorrow, climate change wonâ€™t wait til then.
                                              We are the leaders of today, and present this submission to you so
                                              you also can leave your legacy in New Zealand and the world. All it
                                              takes is a few brave and courageous people, like you?

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
