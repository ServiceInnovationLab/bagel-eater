A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We need to conscientiously and actively set up a framework for
important because...                          reducing emissions on a national level, as this will not happen by just
                                              wishing and waiting. The government must enact change by

                                              legislating it, this is the only way private sectors will take part and
                                              make changes.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
Further comments                              We are a small and forward-thinking enough country to be able to

                                              implement climate change quickly and effectively. When the right
                                              steps are made we should be able to get our net carbon emissions to
                                              zero easy peasy!
