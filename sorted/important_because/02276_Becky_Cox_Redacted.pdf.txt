A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Because we need to encourage NZer's to move away from a carbon
important because...                          dependant transport system and into cleaner energy and alternative
                                              transport to move around our cities. This is important for NZ to keep

                                              its clean / green image and not be left behind by the rest of the
                                              world when it comes to sustainable cities and transport. We are small
                                              enough to be agile and world leading in this space, and create a
                                              beautiful place to live for our moko and future generations.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
