A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Zealand is a beautiful country with amazing landscape. Currently
important because...                           with climate change this is consistently deteriorating. We need to do
                                               something to ensure this does not continue and the government

                                               needs to be held accountable so that these changes are made and
                                               stuck to. A law change also needs to occur in order to raise
                                               awareness of the seriousness of the issue and to have the flow on
                                               effect that it holds companies accountable to make change as they
                                               as a consequence will be held to the same legal requirements. Not

                                               only do these changes need to be made for the beautiful scenery in
                                               NZ but also if we continue the way that we are there will be a serious
                                               impact on human life - limited resources, rising sea levels, effects of
                                               food supply - the list continues! Something to needs to change!

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
