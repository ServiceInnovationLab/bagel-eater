A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is New Zealand needs to be heading in a direction that will take care of
important because...                          our future generations, and maintain the ability of people living in
                                              this country to live a healthy, active and clean-air lifestyle.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                              international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              I also think we need to move away from dairy farming and meat
                                              production for this to happen. Yes, it's integral to our identity at the
                                              moment. However, we have the most important thing - the

                                              environment - to look after. Yes, meat can be delicious, but so is
                                              fresh air.
