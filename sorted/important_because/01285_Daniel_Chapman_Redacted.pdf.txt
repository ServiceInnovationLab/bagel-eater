A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is the dynamic equilibrium that we live within is at risk of tipping over a
important because...                          no-return point where my children and their children will be fighting
                                              for survival from the ravages of an unstable climate. We have a

                                              responsibility to the other organisms which we inhabit this earth with
                                              and due to our action, we are fast inhibiting their ability to live
                                              alongside us. New Zealand could be leading the way with putting in
                                              place carbon reduction and achieving carbon neutrality, but we are
                                              not. Let's make it happen and lead by example!

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                              international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
