A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We need to do as much as we possibly can to contain and reduce the
important because...                          effects of climate change both natural and man-made. The lives of
                                              our children and those beyond depend on lessening the harm that

                                              human appetites cause in the destruction of animal and plant life on
                                              earth.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as effective
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
Further comments                              We will need the wisest counsel available to effectively lay out for

                                              the general public the actual, fact-based effects of doing little or
                                              nothing AS WELL AS practical steps that individuals can take as
                                              participants in the processes of reducing the damage we all do.
