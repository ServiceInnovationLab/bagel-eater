A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Because it affects each and everyone of us. Getting this right is vital
important because...                          as without every opportunity being seized now to make an impact
                                              such as the zero carbon bill - we will have larger issues facing the

                                              nation due to our impact and the effects we have long term. Without
                                              these changes coming into affect all other challenges nationally and
                                              globally become a very distant 2nd. We need this for not only our
                                              immediate future but future generations also securing what we once
                                              took as being the norm what we expected to have access to, to

                                              enjoy, to thrive and live along side of is now changing so rapidly we
                                              are in real danger of loosing so much far too quickly by inaction.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
