A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I am concerned about human -induced climate change, and I think
important because...                           there are also other, strong reasons for moving away from fossil
                                               fuels. This includes global conflicts caused by mining them, and the

                                               pollution and health issues caused by burning them. I also enjoy
                                               intensive cities that are dominated by public transport, cycling and
                                               walking, far more than use of private vehicles. I would prefer to see
                                               us move towards this model in our urban areas, regardless of uptake
                                               of electric cars.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                               international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it must honour Te
                                               Tiriti o Waitangi. It must ensure a healthy transition for workers and
                                               communities, and help us prevent passing on the costs of climate
                                               change and/ or carbon emissions to future generations.

Further comments                               New Zealand is poorly placed to address climate change currently,
                                               but will feel the effects of rising sea levels and possibly of global

                                               conflicts. However we are well-placed to turn our climate policy
                                               around, if we do this under the current government with strong
                                               climate policy and ethics. Let's do this!
