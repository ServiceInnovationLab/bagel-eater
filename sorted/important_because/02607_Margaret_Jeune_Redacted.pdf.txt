A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Nature is already feeling the effects of the changing climate.Getting
important because...                          to net- zero global emissions by the middle of the century is essential
                                              if we are to keep the impacts of climate change on people and

                                              nature to a minimum.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              We need a plan so that when we're making decisions like how to use
                                              land,including farms and forests and what machinery to buy(coal or

                                              wood-fired),we do it knowing that if it's going to last a long time,it
                                              needs to be consistent with New Zealand's zero- carbon target.
