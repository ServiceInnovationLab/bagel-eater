A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Climate change is now an inevitable reality. It is not a question of
important because...                          avoiding disaster but of mitigating it. I am moving from my current
                                              suburb because it will be under water in a few decades.


                                              The only way to tackle this is with collective action. As long as
                                              carbon emissions are volutary the market will always dictate that the
                                              company not going with the more expensive action.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
