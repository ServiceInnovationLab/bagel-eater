 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is The climate changes we are seeing already are causing great harm.
 important because...                          If we don't change our behaviour regarding fossil fuels and petrol
                                               carbon products our children and grandchildren will suffer greatly. It

                                               is a moral issue that human behaviour threatens the whole world.
                                               The wealthy countries have caused most of the damage and the poor
                                               are suffering most of the harm so far.

 Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

 Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

 Further comments                              There are great opportunities for turning things around but greed
                                               and selfishness are the barriers
