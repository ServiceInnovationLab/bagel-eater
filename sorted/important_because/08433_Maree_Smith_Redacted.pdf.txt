A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is NZ must act now to take drastic action to cut Carbon. We should be
important because...                          leading the way globally in this area. Almost half of NZ's emission
                                              inventory results from agriculture - with Methane making up the

                                              majority of emissions from the sector. We must be innovative as
                                              Kaitiaki of our natural environment and we must protect the planet fo
                                              future generations.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits. If International credits are used then
                                              they must be verified as being 'real' and should not impact NZ's

                                              carbon credits by lowering the price and reducing incentives to plant
                                              trees in NZ.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
