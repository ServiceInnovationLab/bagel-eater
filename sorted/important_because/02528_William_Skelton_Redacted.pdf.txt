A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is It is critical to the survival of all life on earth. Continued failure by
important because...                          governments and the general population is inexcusable. Attempts to
                                              rationalize away the fundamental imperative if mitigating climate

                                              change by scare mongering with distorted visions of economic
                                              collapse will lead to exactly the result those desperate to maintain
                                              their economic stranglehold on the majorities are fundamentally
                                              doomed to fail. It will not be a pleasant experience when global
                                              desperation reaches its tipping point and this event horizon is

                                              accelerating toward us.

                                              Speak up NOW! Do what you know is right. Have courage and you
                                              will be a real human being hero.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
