A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I was sitting outside at night with my 22 year old daughter. we used
important because...                          to live 15 km to the north and we were thinking the edge of
                                              atmosphere, skin around the earth is just as far, straight up as it is to

                                              our old house. She finds it terrifying, so do I, how little that is and
                                              how fragile and easily wrecked. She is a smart woman, she knows
                                              the science, she is right to be afraid and we must give her, and her
                                              generation, hope of a future.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              No more excuses, there is no planet B, we face mass extinctions of
                                              species including our own.
