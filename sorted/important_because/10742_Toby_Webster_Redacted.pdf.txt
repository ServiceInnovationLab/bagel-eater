A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We have an obligation to future generations and to the rest of the
important because...                          world to do our part. Nations like Aotearoa, where we have relatively
                                              low economic and industrial inertia, must lead the way. We've always

                                              described ourselves as citizens of the world and tidy kiwis. Lets live
                                              up to that, and help preserve the natural beauty of this land.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations. It must also make
                                              provision for holding both local and international business
                                              accountable in a way that presents a significant and legitimate
                                              deterrant to breach of the act and abuse of the environment.
