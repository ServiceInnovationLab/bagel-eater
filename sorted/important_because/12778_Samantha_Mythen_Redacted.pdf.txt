A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is so so important because
important because...                          the future of New Zealand, of the human race and of Earth is in our
                                              hands. We can no longer keep discussing climate change and

                                              pondering over what to do, but we need to take ACTION. This Act is a
                                              wonderful tool that we can use to divert the course of history. We
                                              can tell the younger generations that we stood up for the Earth and
                                              gave her a voice.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              New Zealand is known for it's beautiful environment and we need to
                                              protect it. We could be a leader on the world scale of combating
                                              climate change. The time to act is now.
