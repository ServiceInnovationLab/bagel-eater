 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is A climate law like Zero Carbon Act is important to New Zealand in
 important because...                          order to keep our emissions down. Studying urban planning at the
                                               University of Auckland, has made me realise to find future outcomes

                                               of reducing climate change via public transport, agricultural
                                               practices, and using more sustainable building materials and
                                               renewable energies for urban development.

 Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

 Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
