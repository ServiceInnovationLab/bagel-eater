A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I have two kids, I feel that this is one of the biggest challenges of our
important because...                           time. I want to be able to tell my kids that this generation is doing
                                               EVERYTHING we can to ensure their planet is livable for them and

                                               their children. This is not someone else's problem, this is ours and we
                                               need to own it. We are ready for strong leadership and for change.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
Further comments                               Make sure please that we don't look to pine forests for the majority

                                               of our carbon sink. Diversity if the key to resilience in all things
                                               including our forests. Pines kill our soil and our waterways.
