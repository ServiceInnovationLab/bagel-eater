A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is our future depends on it. We need to act now and to act boldly, and
important because...                           for this reason I strongly support the Zero Carbon Act and believe
                                               that it must contain strong and ambitious actions and targets. I

                                               support the call by Ora Taiao for legislation that is "fast, firm, fair and
                                               founded on Te Tiriti - with health at its heart".
                                               I also support the detailed submission made by Generation Zero.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and representative of Tiriti partnership.
                                               The Commission should advise the government on targets and policy

                                               planning. The Government should have to publicly respond to, and
                                               provide rationale when it deviates from the Commissionâ€™s advice.
                                               The Climate Commission should also act as an independent
                                               watchdog, publishing progress reports and highlighting problems.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
Further comments                               I agree with the submission by Generation Zero, that "Climate

                                               change is bigger than politics", and that we need responses that look
                                               beyond the three year election cycle and offer sustainable, long term
                                               solutions.
