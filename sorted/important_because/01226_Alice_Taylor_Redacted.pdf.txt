A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is This is the future! This is the future for our economy, for our
important because...                         upcoming generations, and importantly for out planet. We, as a
                                             nation, need to get ahead of the curve.

Long-term target                             I support the pursuit of the most ambitious target - reducing total

                                             greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a
                                             science-based approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions
                                             are as efficient and effective as possible: we should aim for negative
                                             levels of long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases to
                                             sustainable levels. This target should be reached by reducing our

                                             own emissions and building our forest sinks, not by using
                                             international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides sound, evidence-based
                                             advice, but does not make final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
