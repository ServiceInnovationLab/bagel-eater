A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We have suspected for the last 70 years that our activities were
important because...                          changing the climate of our planet, and known for the last 40 years
                                              that our atmosphere is absorbing 0.68 watts per square meter per

                                              day (the equivalent of dropping 400,000 Hiroshima bombs per day).
                                              Yet we have done nothing substantive. We are not prepared for what
                                              is coming. Already we are getting storms beyond what our
                                              infrastructure can handle, and they will get significantly worse before
                                              we have any hope of improvement, even if we take the most

                                              stringent action we can to reduce CO2 in the atmosphere.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              Please, please, treat this as the most important issue at all times.
                                              Because it is.
