A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is
important because...                         Climate change is the most important issue of the next 100 years.

Long-term target                             A long term target is good but we must start moving in the right
                                             direction now. This target should be reached by reducing our own

                                             emissions and not by using international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, whether it makes
                                             final decisions or not.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation as soon as possible.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
                                             Farmers and rich people are not the only ones with a stake in our

                                             climate.

Further comments                             We have delayed too long. Lets make a start today.
