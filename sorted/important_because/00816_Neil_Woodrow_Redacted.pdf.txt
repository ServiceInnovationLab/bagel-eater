A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is It will provide a framework for assessing legislative decisions that
important because...                         potentially impact on the longer term NZ contribution towards
                                             reversing climate change .

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                             international carbon credits. The approach should also assess the
                                             economic impact of changes, with a long term objective to maximise
                                             benefits and minimise costs to the overall economy.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours all New
                                             Zealanders, ensures a just transition for businesses, workers and

                                             communities; and avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
