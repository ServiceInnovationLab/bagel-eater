A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is While it's a complicated and controversial matter, it's also simple.
important because...                           We need change. I like to think of my actions as directly impacting
                                               the next generation; my children and my friends children. I feel it's

                                               my responsibility and duty to leave this earth in the best state
                                               possible for them because I hope that's what others would do for me.
                                               The one thing that keeps going through my mind is "Why not?" It
                                               would be detrimental for me, with such privileges, voice and
                                               opportunity I have been born into in this beautiful country, to waste

                                               it. Please, this is important for Aotearoa.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
