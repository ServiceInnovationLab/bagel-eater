 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is
 important because...                         I'm young and this is MY future.

 Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                           I support an independent Climate Commission that is made up of
                                              experts and provides advice and can make some decisions.

 Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi; ensures a just

                                              transition for workers and communities.
