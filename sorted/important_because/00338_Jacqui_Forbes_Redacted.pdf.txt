 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is we don't have any time to waste. Climate change is dangerous and
 important because...                          expensive too. We live forgetting that we are a part of nature and we
                                               need to be compatible with the systems of this planet first and

                                               foremost. There are probably too many human beings on planet
                                               Earth, we therefore need to be really careful about how we live on
                                               our beautiful planet.

 Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

 Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

 Further comments                              Investment now will save money in the future, it we don't put money
                                               in now then we will pay much more later on. Be wise, invest now.
