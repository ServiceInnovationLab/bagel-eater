A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is 1. It sends a message to the word that we in New Zealand are
important because...                           listening to the other countries / international organisations that are
                                               making progress / trying to hold country accountable.

                                               2. The environment is the most important thing in the world. It
                                               supports all life, all human life and it will be our legacy - good or bad
                                               - the future generations. It is our responsibility as the dominant
                                               lifeforms of this planet to look after it.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also strongly support taking a science-

                                               based approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as
                                               impactful as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived
                                               gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This
                                               target should be reached by reducing our own emissions as much as
                                               possible and not by using international carbon credits. We must also

                                               help our vulnerable pacific neighbors.
Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               The longer we put this off the harder it will be and the larger the
                                               consequences.
