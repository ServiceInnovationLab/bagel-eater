A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is the effects of climate change are being felt more and more. We need
important because...                           to take measures now before it is too late, and the Zero Carbon Act
                                               is an important step in this area. Although a small country, every bit

                                               helps. We have access to natural energy sources and new
                                               technology means non-renewable resources are not essential
                                               anymore. I want my children to grow up healthy and able to enjoy
                                               the beauty and relatively clean environment that my generation and
                                               those before me have been blessed with. I also don't want our greed

                                               to have a negative effect on those living in poorer nations around the
                                               world.

Long-term target                               I support the target of reducing total greenhouse gases to zero by
                                               2050 (albeit recognising this is a big challenge), with efforts to
                                               reduce our carbon emissions as much as possible immediately. I also
                                               support taking a science-based approach to ensure our efforts to

                                               reduce emissions are as effective as possible: we should aim for
                                               negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases
                                               to sustainable levels. I strongly believe this target should be reached
                                               by reducing our own emissions and not by using international carbon
                                               credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               Thank you for your time and consideration of this matter.
