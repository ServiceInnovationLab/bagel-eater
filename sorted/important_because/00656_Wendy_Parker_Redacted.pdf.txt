A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is this is the first time the entire world has a scientifically proven global
important because...                           crisis to deal with. Most countries acknowledge the evidence and
                                               have shown their concern for global warming by signing up to their

                                               responsibilities to reduce it under the Paris Agreement. There is a
                                               genuine need for this action to be taken with urgency and cross-
                                               party political involvement is the only way for governments to act
                                               with responsibility for long term gains for humans and the planet.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               If an Act such as this were to remain within the scope of party
                                               politics, nothing would be achieved because of vested interests. The
                                               world is at a crisis point and there is no longer time for politicking.
                                               We need a cross-party commitment that is well advised and

                                               prepared to act with integrity. There is no time for delay.
