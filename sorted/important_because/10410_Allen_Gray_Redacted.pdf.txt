A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is In terms of the generic collapse of global ecosystems currently
important because...                           underway, the effects of climate change upon the Earth, the
                                               ecosystems of the Earth, and the peoples of the Earth is the most

                                               difficult to deal with. Having said that, the major cause of the
                                               collapse of global ecosystems is the impact of industrial civilisation
                                               upon the living Earth - get rid of this, and we may solve the climate
                                               problem, along with many others.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking an approach that

                                               ensures our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible:
                                               we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                               short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target should be reached
                                               by reducing our own emissions and not by using international carbon
                                               credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
