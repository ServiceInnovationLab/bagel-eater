A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Passing a strong and comprehensive Zero Carbon Act is vital
important because...                         because the time to act is now and Aotearoa has the potential to be
                                             a leader in this area. We must be bold and ambitious for the future of

                                             our children.

Long-term target                             I wholeheartedly agree that we need the ambitious target of
                                             reducing total greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050. I support a
                                             science-based approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions
                                             are as impactful as possible: we should aim for negative levels of
                                             long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable

                                             levels. This target should be reached by reducing our own emissions.
Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              Tangata Whenua must be consulted in the development of a Zero
                                             Carbon Act, as is their right under Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
