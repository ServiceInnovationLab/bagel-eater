A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is An ambitious carbon policy is a moral obligation to future
important because...                          generations of New Zealanders and Pacifica peoples. Given our
                                              geographic economic context it behooves us to take a leadership

                                              role in this space. Carbon policy must be comprehensive and
                                              ambitious as it will affect to course of our social and economy
                                              development and impact on most other aspects of public policy. Its
                                              therefore very important to get this piece of legislation right.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
