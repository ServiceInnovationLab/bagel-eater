A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We need to have this law to ensure that the generation that is being
important because...                           born, has a earth that is habitable when they grow old and so on for
                                               generations to come. Climate change is affecting the world faster

                                               than most predicted. New Zealand needs to lead the way on this
                                               initiative, so that other countries have a basis and follow our lead!
                                               I love nature, birds are one of my favourites. A friend of mine
                                               recently visited Canada and noted how eerily it was with few birds.
                                               (Mining of the Canadian oil sands up north is having a massive effect

                                               on the nature)

                                               we continue to lose nature to extinction, that it happens so
                                               frequently now that few sit up and take notice.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

                                               We need to take the lead absolutely. Set our own goals and then
                                               ways we are going to achieve such an ambitious target.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations!

Further comments                               I feel honoured to live in a country that has moral convictions and
                                               that is taking the lead, to make a better tomorrow, for not only NZ

                                               but the world!
