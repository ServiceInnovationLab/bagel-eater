A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Only legislation will get the job done. We need systematic change
important because...                         towards a zero carbon economy.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by as soon as possible, 2050 at the very latest.


                                             I also support taking a science-based approach to ensure our efforts
                                             to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible: we should aim for
                                             negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases
                                             to sustainable levels. This target should be reached by reducing our

                                             own emissions and not by using international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                             This is urgent work. It must happen.
