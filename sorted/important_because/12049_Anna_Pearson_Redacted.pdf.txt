A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is A climate law clarifies our country's position on Climate Change and
important because...                         makes change mandatory, which is the only way I think we'll get
                                             results.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                             as possible. We should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                             international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              We must avoid passing on the costs of Climate Change to future
                                             generations.
