A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We only have one planet! And we are destroying it fast. Zero carbon
important because...                          is just the beginning of what we should be doing! Zero pollution of
                                              any kind, zero deforestation, negative population growth, negative

                                              economic growth etc should be the aim! Sounds impossible? Well,
                                              it’s either that or we die. Sorry. The planet will be fine, it’s been
                                              through a whole lot extremer conditions. But it won’t be viable for us
                                              anymore.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2020. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for very rapid adaptation being included in the Zero
                                              Carbon Act. We don’t have time to adapt slowly.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
