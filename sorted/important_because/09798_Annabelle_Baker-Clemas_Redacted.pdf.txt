A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is There are people around who know ways we could effectively stop
important because...                         using carbon emitting processes in and "for" our day to day lives and
                                             consuming. WHY DO WE NOT PUT THESE HARMLESS OR LESS

                                             HARMFUL TECHNIQUES TO THE TOP OF THE LIST FOR EVERY PERSON
                                             AND COMPANY IN NEW ZEALAND. We are no longer being governed
                                             by money hungry bussiness men/politicians so lets show everyone in
                                             and around New Zealand just that and make a difference, before
                                             there is ZERO chance to right our wrongs. :) Every person in the

                                             world is effected by us, just acting like we are not going to be
                                             effected.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                             international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
