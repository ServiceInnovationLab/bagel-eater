A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I support strong climate law such as the Zero Carbon Act because I
important because...                           am concerned about the impact that warmer temperatures will have
                                               on our Aotearoa as we know it., our ability to grow the crops that we

                                               do and being an island nation we are already seeing the devastating
                                               impacts that rising sea levels can have like on the West Coast of the
                                               South Island.

Long-term target                               Everyone will benefit from the total greenhouse gases to net zero by
                                               2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to ensure our
                                               efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible: We should

                                               aim for negative levels of all gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits because we should not have to ride the
                                               coat tails of others achievements we should be able to pave the way
                                               for our own sustainable society.

Climate Commission                             I believe the only way this will be effective is with the establishment
                                               of an independent Climate Commission that is made up of experts

                                               and provides advice, but does not make final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               The decision for this policy needs to be based not on the currency of
                                               money but on the currency of quality of life.
