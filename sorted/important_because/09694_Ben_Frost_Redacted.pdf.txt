A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I have two kids who's future I want to help safeguard. I am a Passive
important because...                          House Designer working in an NZ Construction industry responsible
                                              for a huge proportion of the Carbon footprint. Trying to change the

                                              'norm' and do better than the very poor Building Code we have here
                                              is like trying to turn around the Titanic. I really hope that Acts such
                                              as this have a positive knock-on effect to the construction industry,
                                              NZ Building Code and wider manufacturing industries so that we can
                                              avoid the ever looming iceberg...

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                              international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts, listens to advice from experts in their
                                              field and not lobbyists, and is able to make an impact on the decision
                                              making process.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair and avoids passing on the
                                              costs to future generations.
