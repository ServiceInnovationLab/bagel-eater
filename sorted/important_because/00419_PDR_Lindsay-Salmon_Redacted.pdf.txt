 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I have grandchildren and I want them to be able live outside an eco-
 important because...                          dome! Zero carbon is vital to help stabalise the damage we've
                                               already done to the climate.

 Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                               gases to net zero by 2050. We've got to do it! I also support taking a
                                               science-based approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions
                                               are making enough impact: we should aim for negative levels of
                                               long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable
                                               levels. This target should be reached by reducing our own emissions

                                               and not by using international carbon credits. Sadly we can't trust
                                               the international credits, we must do it on our own..

 Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission.
                                               It ought to be composed of experts and they should provide advice,
                                               but the final decisions need everyone's input.

 Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on too much of the costs to future generations.

 Further comments                              It's nearly too late. We are certainly losing our native habitats and
                                               wild life because of climate change already - yellow eyed penguins

                                               are a good example of a threatened species. Please get us on the
                                               track of zero carbon.
