A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I am concerned for the terrible ramifications that human kind will
important because...                          suffer if we do not curb climate change through government
                                              measures. Even if New Zealand is able to avoid such consequences

                                              for the time being, due to our relative development and privilege, I
                                              am concerned for those in developing countries who have done very
                                              little to contribute to climate change globally, and yet are now most
                                              at risk for its effects. I think it is only true to New Zealand's
                                              pioneering and humanitarian spirit to not only do this for future

                                              generations, but also for those in the immediate future who will
                                              suffer unduly.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
