A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is all the experts tell us we must act immediately or the world will face
important because...                          environmental and therefore economic and geo-political chaos.
                                              There is no other option but to radically change the way we think

                                              about transport, housing, waste, our economy etc. This is more than
                                              our Nuclear Free Moment - it is even more serious than that...

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits. Future governments should not be able
                                              to reverse decisions unless the independent Climate Commission
                                              okays the changes.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions. Future governments should not be able to reverse
                                              decisions unless the independent Climate Commission okays the
                                              changes.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it ensures a just
                                              transition for workers and communities.

Further comments                              Please act boldly - this will be painful and expensive but we are all
                                              doomed if governments and societies do not accept we need to
                                              change our habits and economies. The benefits of taking extreme

                                              action now will be huge - our green tourism industry will take off
                                              even more, the air will be cleaner and people will be healthier.
