A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We need to act now to ensure the future for our children and their
important because...                          children. The world is not ours to destroy. I support every effort the
                                              government makes to reduce our emissions and support other

                                              nations in doing so. It’s not a popular subject to broach but it needs
                                              to be NOW!

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
Further comments                              Thank you to all the amazing volunteers out there, working tirelessly.

                                              You are incredible and I support you! I want to do a lot more once my
                                              little boys are a bit more independent, I’ll be raising them to be eco
                                              warriors for the future of New Zealand and the world.
