A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is we need this law because climate change is the most pressing issue
important because...                          of our time

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              I would like to add an 'outside the box' viewpoint which stems from
                                              Traditional Chinese medicine. This medico-philosophy observes great
                                              detail in regard to disharmonies relating to climatic influences on
                                              both the body and nature. The unity of the microcosm of human life

                                              and the macrocosm of nature is a guiding principle. When climatic
                                              influences of damp, cold, wind, heat, dryness become excessive, the
                                              impact is noticeable and somewhat predictable. Examining climate
                                              change issues through the lens of 5-phase theory of Traditional
                                              Chinese Medicine can offer added insights into health and

                                              environmental wellbeing.
                                              This modern/ancient perspective offers a more pressing perspective
                                              on climate change and one which ordinary people can take on board
                                              and understand via a simple DIY application that is in development.
