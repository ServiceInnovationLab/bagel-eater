A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is it will be the central uniting strategy for facing our climate change
important because...                          challenge. Surviving the climate change we have already set in train
                                              as an organised global civilization means we will positively impact all

                                              components of human sustainabilty: economic, social and cultural.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              A fiscally neutral carbon tax is a really good idea.
                                              Ameliorating the impact of the zero carbon act on those industries

                                              and individuals most invested in fossil fuels and traditional farming
                                              will also be a vital aspect of the Act: however, their inconvenience
                                              and resistance must not be allowed to deflect our nation's will and
                                              urgent need to achieve the carbon neutral goal by 2050.
