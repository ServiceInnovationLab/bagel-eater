A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Ultimately, the climate isn't what needs saving - its us. And
important because...                           ultimately, climate change isn't an environmental problem - its a
                                               human behaviour problem; and solution. In that vein, one of the

                                               ABCs of behaviour change is to set a concrete goal with a deadline,
                                               which is what this act does. Even if we don't achieve it, the fact that
                                               we are thinking in this fashion I think is a step forward - namely, we
                                               are going to have to BEHAVE differently, and quickly, if we are going
                                               to save ourselves.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                               international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
