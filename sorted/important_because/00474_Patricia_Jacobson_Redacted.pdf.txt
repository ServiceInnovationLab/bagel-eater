 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is without government action and a concerted plan nothing we do will
 important because...                           be fully effective.

 Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                                gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                                approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                                as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                                while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                                should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                                international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                                that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                                final decisions.

 Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                                Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                                avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

 Further comments                               I am aware that so many of our supposed reductions actually add to
                                                our carbon total. Single use plastic bags may not be as bad as the
                                                substitute. My concern is that we truly investigate the alternative
                                                suggestions offered. I am all for electric cars but they also have their

                                                downside and though the batteries are being improved there is still
                                                some negatives. Can we make sure out alternatives stand up to
                                                scrutiny.
