A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I feel it is the moral responsibility of world leading countries such as
important because...                          New Zealand to make a stand and set high standards especially in
                                              light of recent decisions made by so called world leaders such as the

                                              US. I also feel NZ as a country with its unique environment and
                                              glacial systems is one of those worldwide that stands to lose the
                                              most from anthropogenic induced climate change in both the short
                                              term and the long run so it is important to act now.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
