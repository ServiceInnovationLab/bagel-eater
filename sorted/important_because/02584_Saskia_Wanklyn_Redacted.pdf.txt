A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Climate change is the biggest issue facing the world. There is no
important because...                          more time left to delay dealing with climate change. Nationwide
                                              intervention on climate change and a change to our lifestyles must

                                              happen now. The environment is of utmost importance and the
                                              destruction of it is not acceptable and not worth any sum of money.
                                              Climate change is already negatively impacting many lives and often
                                              affecting poorer and indigenous communities disproportionately.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
