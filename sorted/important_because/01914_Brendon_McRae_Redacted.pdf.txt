A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Its about future generations, about my grandchildren and this good
important because...                          earth we live on. God gave us a planet to take care of, not plunder
                                              and wreck. What will future generations say about us. I don;t think it

                                              will be positive. We need to act now.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              Come on New Zealand. Lets stop the hypocrisy and front up to our
                                              100% pure label which we tell the rest of the world.
