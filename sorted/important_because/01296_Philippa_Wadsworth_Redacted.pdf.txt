A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is The increasing carbon levels are changing our planet and affecting
important because...                           the life on it. It is causing suffering to living things that cannot adapt
                                               to the changes. This includes sea life an land life, some of which are

                                               badly affected already, such as the coral reefs and polar bears. It is
                                               heart breaking to think of the suffering which is yet to come.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice. I think that the
                                               commission should be able to override decisions if the target is not
                                               being met. It is vital that the commission needs to be independent

                                               and and the members making the decisions have no conflicts of
                                               interest.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               This act is vitally important to be implemented as soon as possible.
