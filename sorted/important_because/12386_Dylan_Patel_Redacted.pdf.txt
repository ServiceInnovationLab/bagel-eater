A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is New Zealand should be at the forefront of this movement and set an
important because...                          example for the rest of the world. It isn't impossible to become
                                              carbon free and all it takes is a little bit of time and effort now for it

                                              to be a big help in the future. I hope to see a 100% renewable
                                              energy NZ before I die and instead of tax payer money being spent
                                              on Northland it should be spent on renewable energy sources as well
                                              as new recycling plants or a ban on plastic and invest on renewable
                                              and recyclable materials such as bees wax etc.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                              international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              We are the future, we are the younger generation, we want change
                                              and we don't want to wait for you old school shits to make a change.
                                              We want it now.


                                              There will be huge consequences to future generations to come.
