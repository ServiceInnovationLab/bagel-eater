 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I would like to pass on our Earth to future generations in as near the
 important because...                          same condition into which I was lucky enough to be born. I do not
                                               want to see the ever diminishing number of species further stressed

                                               by climate change, or wars begin over reduced habitable lands, or all
                                               living things starved and thirsty because we did not do enough to
                                               halt our destruction.

 Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

 Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations. I would like to see
                                               those who have the most wealth within New Zealand pay the most
                                               towards a carbon free future.

 Further comments                              I would like the younger generations to have a larger say in how we
                                               deal with reducing our carbon emissions.
