A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is It holds the government and businesses to account and individuals
important because...                          clear, science-based goals and targets to meet. Climate change is
                                              the biggest issue facing our world today. Personally I am incredibly

                                              concerned about how climate change is affecting our oceans and
                                              destroying ecosystems as our oceans are the life-force that allow for
                                              the survival of every other organism and environment on the planet.
                                              The Zero Carbon Act gives a focus to enable targets to be met and
                                              commitments from different sectors to be measured which is one of

                                              the most important ways to mobilise and create lasting change as
                                              seeing positive results reinforces more positive action to occur.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
