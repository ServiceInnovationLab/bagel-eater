A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Growing up on Motu Aotea/Great Barrier Island, I learnt the value of
important because...                          sustainability and stewardship of our natural resources, which has
                                              unfortunately taken a back seat during this age of mass production

                                              and maximizing profits. Both to protect Aotearoa’s environmental
                                              integrity and allow us to keep perspective, we should aim to dedicate
                                              much of our time and energy to acting as stewards of our
                                              environment.
                                              Now, living in New York City, with its extreme pollution on land, air,

                                              and water, I have further realized just how easy it can be for us to
                                              ignore the needs of the environment and live in blissful naivety. We
                                              need to combat this on every level, and frankly, I’m my opinion,
                                              there is no better way to do this than through direct federal
                                              legislative change.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                              international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              I also support the widespread planting of native trees to both act as
                                              a carbon sink and to make up for widespread deforestation in
                                              Aotearoa.
