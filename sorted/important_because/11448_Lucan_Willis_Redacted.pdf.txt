A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I am 17 and in the generation that will have to deal most with the
important because...                           effects of climate change for our entire adult lives. It is also my
                                               generation that will have to raise a family into a world damaged by

                                               our destructive gas emissions. Any opportunity to reduce the
                                               damage that we are doing to our climate I will jump at because it is
                                               my future and my eventual childrenâ€™s futures that are at risk if we do
                                               nothing.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               Just a plea to anyone opposing this movement. Please think beyond
                                               your own lifespan to the lives of your children, grandchildren and
                                               great grandchildren to come, because climate change is here and it
                                               is very real and it is/will effect our lives in a negative way.
