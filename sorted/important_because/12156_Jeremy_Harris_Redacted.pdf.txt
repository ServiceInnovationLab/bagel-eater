A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is The world is at a tipping point when it comes to our climate. We need
important because...                          to act fast, and reduce our carbon footprint to allow the world to
                                              survive, and civilization to continue. The cost of inaction is too

                                              immense. We must act now, and reduce our carbon output to zero.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              Thank you for taking time, and reading this submission. I appreciate
                                              you all and all you do. I am excited by the future and hope that you

                                              are too, and are willing to what it takes to ensure it is as beautiful as
                                              it can be. Arohanui.
