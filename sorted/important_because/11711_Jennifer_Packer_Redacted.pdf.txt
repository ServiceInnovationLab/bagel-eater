A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Because we must act now, and across all sectors of our society if we
important because...                          are to have any hope of mitigating disastrous climate change. We
                                              finally have a government that understands the issues and I want to

                                              give them a mandate to do what needs to be done in order to give
                                              my children's generation a chance.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
Further comments                              Faced with sudden and deadly emergencies, like the CHCH

                                              earthquakes, people showed that they could pull together, dropping
                                              all their other differences for their common humanity. It seems
                                              harder to get people to put aside political and class differences for a
                                              long and slow emergency, but that's what we have to do. If this govt
                                              can manage to grt the opposition onside, to work together in this

                                              desperate emergency, it'll show leadership to the rest of us, with all
                                              our differences, and encourage real action where it's needed.
