A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is The earth is like a parent to us - providing for us, nurturing us, want
important because...                           us to thrive. We shouldn't treat our parent like we do our earth with
                                               this profit-driven, consuming mentality. It's not good for earth, it's

                                               not good for us. We need each other.
                                               Aotearoa wouldn't be without the long, white cloud. If we advertise
                                               ourselves as green, let's be green. Greed has gotten in the way of
                                               Green.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice based on research,

                                               not politics. The commission does not make final decisions but works
                                               on the behalf of New Zealanders and others who live here.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations or to point the
                                               finger at past generations for the problem. Just do something.

Further comments                               The problem has been generated and perpetuated by a minority of
                                               greedy businesses and politicians and others with decision-making

                                               power haven't taken it seriously. It's almost too late. It's too late to
                                               ignore it. I don't want my retirement to be spent in climate chaos.
