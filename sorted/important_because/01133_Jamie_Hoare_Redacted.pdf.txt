A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is in order to ensure a habitable planet for our tamariki and mokopuna,
important because...                          we must act together to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions
                                              locally and globally. Aotearoa New Zealand has it's part to play in

                                              mitigating the catastrophic effects of global climate change.
                                              Furthermore, this law will move technology, business, and lifestyles
                                              in Aotearoa New Zealand closer in line with the regenerative and
                                              circulars laws of nature. To live sustainably, we must alter our
                                              lifestyles to align with these natural laws.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                              international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
