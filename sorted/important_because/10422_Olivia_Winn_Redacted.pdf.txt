A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Continued reliance on a non-sustainable resource is short-sighted
important because...                          approach and I support the most ambitious target of reducing total
                                              greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050.

Long-term target                              I also support taking a science-based approach to ensure our efforts

                                              to reduce emissions have as much impact as possible: we should aim
                                              for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived
                                              gases to sustainable levels. This target should be reached by
                                              reducing our own emissions and not by using international carbon
                                              credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              As an energy engineer, I understand the importance of fossil fuels in
                                              the transport sector, but there are options other than fossil fuels
                                              available for ground transport; additionally, having the goal of net
                                              zero carbon emissions will help to push further development in the

                                              air and sea transport sectors.
