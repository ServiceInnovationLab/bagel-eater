A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is NZ needs to do our share in mitigating the impacts of climate
important because...                          change. We have many industries where there are opportunities we
                                              can take to reduce emissions. I work in the transport sector, and

                                              heavily support a greater amount of freight being moved by rail, in
                                              conjunction with the electrification of our rail network. Investors need
                                              to have a greater incentive to purchase vehicles (locomotives, even
                                              ferries) which are as fuel efficient as possible, or even electric.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.
                                              I support the government being able to alter the carbon budgets, but
                                              only to make our targets stricter.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              We also need to move away intensive dairy farming in New Zealand,
                                              it is having disastrous effects on our waterways. Farmers should

                                              have more incentive to at least move to less intensive dairy farming,
                                              or be given the opportunity and help to transform their land into non-
                                              pastoral horticultural forms of land use.
