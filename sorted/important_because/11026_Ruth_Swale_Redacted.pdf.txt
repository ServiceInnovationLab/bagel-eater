A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Extremes of adverse weather events are already having an impact
important because...                          here (and world-wide) and they will only accelerate unless effective
                                              action is taken.

Long-term target                              I support the target of net zero of overall greenhouse gases by 2050.

                                              I also support taking a science-based approach to ensure our efforts
                                              to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible: we should aim for
                                              negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases
                                              to sustainable levels. This target should be reached by reducing our
                                              own emissions and not by using international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              I support the goal of setting binding cross-party targets, as the
                                              importance of combatting climate change transcends the divisions of
                                              party politics.
