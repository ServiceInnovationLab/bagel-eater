A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is we need to bind all future governments, once the wording of the act
important because...                         is agreed on, and therefore ensure there is a broad consensus
                                             among the major political parties. This is necessary to provide a

                                             sustainable path into our future and give stability and certainty to
                                             the business and corporate world.

Long-term target                             I support reduction of our total greenhouse gases to net zero by
                                             2050 (and preferably sooner) and I don't want New Zealand to
                                             "cheat" by purchasing carbon credits overseas.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I believe that earliest possible adaption towards a sustainable future

                                             will be the cheapest overall option and reduce the costs of our
                                             current lifestyle choices that will get passed on to future generations.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
