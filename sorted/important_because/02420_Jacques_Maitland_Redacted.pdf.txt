A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is It ensures that our country plays its part in preventing a climate
important because...                          catastrophe from occurring. It ensures that we preserve our planet
                                              for use by future generations.

                                              The Zero Carbon Act play a part in addressing one of the greatest
                                              challenges of our time, which is human made climate change.
                                              The Zero Carbon Act play a small but required part in addressing the
                                              issue of Climate Change.
                                              Even though New Zealand's contribution to human induced climate

                                              change is small, it is paramount that all people and nations play their
                                              part in addressing climate change and other dangers to the
                                              environment.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
