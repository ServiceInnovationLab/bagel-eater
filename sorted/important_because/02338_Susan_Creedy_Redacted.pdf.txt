A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We are well past easy action on this issue. The facts have been
important because...                           glaringly clear for decades that the planet has been plundered and
                                               abused by human actions. Humankind now has to swallow the bitter

                                               pills for their follies. There are very clear answers to a sustainable
                                               future but the mess is massive. Everyone has to do their bit and live
                                               a much more gentle and rewarding life. Stop using Planet Earth as a
                                               fun park with no regard for the impact on all life. We must revere the
                                               air, water and soils as our life totally depends on their purity.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                               international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.
                                               This is essential with education being the key to success.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               The addiction to consumerism and tourism need very careful
                                               scrutiny. Affluence associated with greed, in all it's forms of

                                               exploitation, are the main contributors to the dreadful miss use of
                                               resources and pollute without a care. Marketing such
                                               "entertainment" should come under expert and informed
                                               examination and control. Education begins at birth. An act alone will
                                               not succeed.
