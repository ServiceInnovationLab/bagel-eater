A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I want our amazing biodiversity to survive into the future. I feel for
important because...                          the life that will suffer with ongoing climate change will bring to
                                              domestic, farm and wild animals, plants, trees invertebrates reptiles

                                              and birds. I also believe our children would want us to do something
                                              about the mess we have created. We need change, we need it now,
                                              and we need a lead from our government to guide our country into
                                              the future for sustainable but immediate and rapid change.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              We have the opportunity to lead the world, to be inspirational and to
                                              make a real difference, lets do it now.
