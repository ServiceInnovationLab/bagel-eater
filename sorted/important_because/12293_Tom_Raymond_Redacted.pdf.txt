A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I am currently studying Natural Resources Engineering and learning
important because...                         about climate change and it's effects has been alarming. I have a
                                             huge passion for the environment and particularly skiing and if

                                             temperature rise continues at it's current rate one day there will be
                                             no winter to enjoy. I view this law as hugely important. It's crucial for
                                             our generation but more importantly younger generations to be able
                                             to enjoy what so many have taken for granted.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                             international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
