A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is without immediate and intense action on the part of the
important because...                          governments the world over we are all up the proverbial creek with a
                                              paddle. No global anything... forget global trade and global

                                              economics, living a long and productive life. All these things are
                                              under siege and we have to act now to evade the worst effects of
                                              climate change. Let's get on with it now!!

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides scientifically based advice to
                                              whatever government is in power in the coming decades.

Adaptation                                    I support a continuously updated adaptation plan being included in

                                              the Zero Carbon Act to ensure the changing needs due to the effects
                                              of climate change are met for both the population of New Zealand
                                              and our pacific neighbours, particularly the vulnerable communities
                                              on low-lying pacific islands.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
