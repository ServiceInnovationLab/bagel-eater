A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We need this planet to keep functioning and global warming will
important because...                         destroy that.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. We must take a science-based approach:

                                             we should achieve negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing
                                             short-lived gases to sustainable levels.

                                             Keep away from international carbon credits - this is about our
                                             performance.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
