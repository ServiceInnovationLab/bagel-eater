A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I'm 39. My generation has failed. We've failed to curb global climate
important because...                          change. We've failed to make a commitment to our children to leave
                                              the world a better place than we were born into.

                                              We still have a change to correct our mistakes and turn things
                                              around for the better. We must always strive to improve things for
                                              those less capable than ourselves. That will always be those that
                                              come after us.


                                              For every small piece of effort we put in now, they can reap a huge
                                              benefit from our dedication and commitment.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
Further comments                              Thank you for taking this seriously and doing your best given difficult

                                              circumstances.
