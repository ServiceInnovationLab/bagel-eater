A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is the Zero Carbon Act is the best thing we can do to ensure a healthy
important because...                          future.
                                              As a doctor, I am very concerned about climate change- particularly

                                              the health impacts. We talk about the environmental impacts, but
                                              the health impacts are already starting to hit too. I want a healthy
                                              future for my children- both their health and the planet's health.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
                                              Further, it must also realise that the burden of climate change will be
                                              disproportionately borne by those with the least ability to adapt. Our
                                              more vulnerable citizens will be more affected and less adaptable;

                                              we must ensure the Act caters fairly to all in our community
