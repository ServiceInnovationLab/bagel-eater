A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I'm concerned about extreme weather, the health of our awa and
important because...                          moana, and the health of our people. I'm also concerned as a global
                                              citizen for climate change refugees and our Pacific neighbours. I

                                              don't want big or little business to profit off the destruction of our
                                              whenua.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
Further comments                              Please take a stand against corporations. Please get them to reduce

                                              their use of plastics in their packaging. Please pass legislation that
                                              makes sustainability easier and disincentivise single-use packaging
                                              and landfill.
