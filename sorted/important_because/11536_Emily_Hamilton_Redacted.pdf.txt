A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Put simply, I want to bring my future family into a world that is fixing
important because...                          itself, rather than continuing to ignore the dire issues our
                                              environment is now facing because of us humans. By changing this

                                              law, it is one of the many steps we can take as a community and a
                                              country to help ensure that the future generations of Aotearoa will
                                              be safe and happy in this land. I want to gift our future the ability to
                                              love this country the way that we love it now, and have loved it in
                                              the past, and we can only do that by preserving and cultivating the

                                              beauty we have now.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
