A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We have to think long-term about this huge issue. If we don’t limit
important because...                          our emissions now our kids and grandkids will suffer. If we don’t pass
                                              laws against carbon emissions, then no-one will look for solutions

                                              and better ways of harnessing energy. If we do get strict now then
                                              lots of scientists and inventors will have to work on alternate energy
                                              supply - benefitting everyone.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              This is urgent and you need to find a way to do it fast and fair.
