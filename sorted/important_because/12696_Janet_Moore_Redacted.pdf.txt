A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Climate change is already worsening existing problems and
important because...                          disrupting people's lives. It will get much, much worse, and setting
                                              mitigation strategies in law is the bare minimum we need to do.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                              international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act,
                                              but given the greater urgency to limit further emissions, and this
                                              country's advantages of flexibility and relative wealth, a plan for
                                              adaptation should be secondary to urgent, deep mitigation.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities
                                              here, while also ensuring that the just transition in this country does
                                              not compromise our efforts to ensure a just transition for people in
                                              communities elsewhere in the world.
