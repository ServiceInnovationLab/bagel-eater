A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Climate change is a huge threat to the peace, prosperity and stability
important because...                          that so many people have worked so hard to achieve. It threatens
                                              everyone's way of life, and the very existence of many people. It is

                                              everyone's responsibility to do something about it - every individual,
                                              family, organisation and government, no matter how small we all
                                              have a contribution to make. New Zealand must set appropriate
                                              policy goals at a national level as we must play our part.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
