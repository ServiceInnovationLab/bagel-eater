A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is A climate law is hugely important to NZ as a country.
important because...                          We are seen as a country of firsts, and yet we are trailing so far
                                              behind in the regulation and reduction of emissions.

                                              I love to spend time in the outdoors. I enjoy skiing in the mountains
                                              and fishing in the ocean.
                                              If ocean acidification and global warming continue to intensify, then
                                              these things that I hold dear to my heart may be just memories one
                                              day, quite soon.

                                              Lets set an ambitious target of net zero emissions by 2050! What a
                                              fantastic goal.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also recommend taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as beneficial
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and definitely not
                                              by using international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
