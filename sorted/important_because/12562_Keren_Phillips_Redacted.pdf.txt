A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Weâ€™re uniquely placed to be influencers on the global stage. NZ Inc is
important because...                          about having impact beyond our size, being a world-leader in ideas.
                                              What bigger idea is there than becoming a truly climate-aware,

                                              sustainably focussed, carbon zero nation who STILL maintains
                                              economic security and social harmony. Every brand strategy needs a
                                              big, hairy, audacious goal - could this be ours?

Long-term target                              I totally excited by the ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
