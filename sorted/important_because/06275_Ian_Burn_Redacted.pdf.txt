A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I'm concerned for the future of in particular myself, my wife and 2
important because...                           children. I don't want them to ask me 'why did you let climate
                                               catastrophe happen', 'why are 100s of millions of people dying and

                                               suffering unnecessarily and painfully.', I don't want my children living
                                               in a world with worse standards of living, lower life expectancy,
                                               higher rates of disease, hardship poverty and increased interethnic
                                               conflict brought about by mass migration.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               Please get this right this time, don't let the oil companies, the PR
                                               front people the fear of economic change deter you from what needs
                                               to be done to make the world healthier safe and fear. Don't let the
                                               lawyers and accountants and other economic rationalists confound

                                               you with their short term fear based circular logic. Look wider, take
                                               hope. Do the right thing.
