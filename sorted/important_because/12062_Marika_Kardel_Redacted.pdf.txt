A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Because we only have this one chance. If we screw up the
important because...                         environment of this planet, our children will have to face the
                                             consequences. I want a world for my kids to blossom and be happy

                                             in, not one where they have to suffer the damages we induced
                                             because we didn't try harder to change our actions for the better. So
                                             if we just keep going as before despite knowing better, how would
                                             we be able to look them in the eyes?

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                             international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
