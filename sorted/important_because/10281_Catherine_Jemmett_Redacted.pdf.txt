A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I love the Earth. Don't you? Humans will do what ever it takes to
important because...                          protect the ones they love, so why can't we do that for our planet
                                              too? Every single action we make in regards to reducing our carbon

                                              footprint counts in ensuring the sustainability of not just New
                                              Zealand, but the whole WORLD. If all of New Zealand unites on this
                                              front, we will undoubtedly make an impact on our planet's future.
                                              New Zealand's actions may sway other countries into introducing this
                                              law too. There are no bad long-term outcomes of the introduction of

                                              the Zero Carbon Act, so we need to just do it!

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
