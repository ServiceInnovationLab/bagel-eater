A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is The environment is so important to protect with climate changing
important because...                          already effective the most vulnerable people and places such as the
                                              pacific with sea level rise destroying people's homes and livelyhoods

                                              alongside climate change creating droughts in Africa. Extra weather
                                              patterns are also present within Aeoteroa and we need to look
                                              seriously at our actions to ensure there is a place for the next
                                              generations.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits. I also believe there needs to be a

                                              human based element looking at what can be done for the pacific
                                              and creating a climate change refugee status

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
