A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is It protects and preserves the country and climate that we currently
important because...                           take for granted. Without initiatives like the Zero Carbon Act,
                                               industries like the skiing and glacier tour industries will face being

                                               shut down. This will lead to the decline of popular snow centres like
                                               Queenstown, Tekapo, Methven, and Arthurs Pass, as well as towns
                                               that rely on glacier tourism such as Fox and Franz Josef. It will also
                                               have a long term effect on coastal communities like Kaikoura and
                                               Stewart Island with climate change and global warming leading to a

                                               rise in ocean levels and temperatures.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
