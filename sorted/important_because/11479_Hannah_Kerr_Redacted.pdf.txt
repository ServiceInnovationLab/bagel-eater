A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We only have one planet! We need to protect the environment for
important because...                          ourselves, generations to come and all the animals who share our
                                              planet!

                                              We are harming our planet and are almost at the point of no return.
                                              Do it for our kids and grandkids, so they can swim in the ocean and
                                              walk in forests and see all the animals not just hear about them in
                                              stories.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
