A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Anthropogenic caused global warming through use of fossil fuels
important because...                           already causes increased frequency of erratic and dangerous
                                               climatic events. Air and water quality is deteriorating rapidly.

                                               Ecosystems are failing through prioritising business profits in areas
                                               completely unsuited. The 6th great extinction is massively underway.
                                               Our responsibility to future generations must be to act now to halt
                                               practices that drive such destruction.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               It is already clear that those populations least endowed with
                                               resources suffer most and often catastrophically from the effects of
                                               global warming. Inequality of opportunity for survival, let alone
                                               wellbeing is increasing as the values which have driven exploitation

                                               of resources to these dangerous levels prevail. Only a combination of
                                               efforts locally and nationally/ internationally working urgently from
                                               now using what we already know is likely to be sufficient to mitigate
                                               for worst scenarios. Short term political expedience must be guarded
                                               against. We have much to do to become Carbon Zero by 2050.
