A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We have a planet. It's beautiful. But we are ruining it. Right now we
important because...                          have the opportunity to make an impact that will last well beyond
                                              ourselves. We have an opportunity to ACT. The best time to plant a

                                              tree is 20 years ago. The next best time is now. This bill is the same.
                                              We need to plant the tree and grow into a new way of doing things to
                                              save this planet beyond the immediate future.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions. This Commission should be enabled and encouraged

                                              to communicate directly with the public on issues to avoid the
                                              government of the day conveniently bogging things down in
                                              paperwork.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              Thank you for your time.
