A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is by ignoring the impacts of Climate Change, we are contributing to
important because...                           yet more damage, in the future, to the environment. It is
                                               unconscionable to ignore what we already know about climate

                                               change, and to continue to jeopardise the health and well-being of
                                               future generations.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions. The independence of a Climate Commission is
                                               essential; equally, this needs to be an advisory body, not a decision-

                                               making body.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               I feel very strongly that the recent tendency to put increased
                                               economic growth at the forefront of planning for the future is deeply
                                               flawed. Concentrating on economic growth is short-sighted the world
                                               is not capable of sustaining constant and unbridled growth. As a

                                               society we must act now, to ensure a future for coming generations,
                                               and a Zero Carbon Act will make a positive contribution to that
                                               action.
