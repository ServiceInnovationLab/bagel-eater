A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is A zero carbon act is inevitable. We chase unlimited growth on a very
important because...                          limited planet. There is short term incentive to pillage all we can
                                              from our land and give nothing back. However we do so by robbing

                                              the quality of life from those who will succeed us. Human induced
                                              climate change is here and has been since the industrial revolution.
                                              Any inaction comes at the cost of lives.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              New Zealand has been a world leader in many progressive acts
                                              throughout recent history. Yet we happily ignore the warning signs
                                              that our 'clean green' land is suffering by our collective hands. This
                                              act is necessary. Either we implement it now and minimise further
                                              damage, our we continue our path of growing inequality and

                                              unnecessarily increase the suffering of future New Zealanders.
