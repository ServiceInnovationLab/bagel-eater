A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is There have to be consequences for destroying a common good.
important because...                          People who are polluting and emitting high greenhouse gases should
                                              not be able to do this so easily, without any cost. As it stands, I am

                                              scared to have children because I am frightened by the thought of
                                              having to raise and protect them in what will soon be a very
                                              dangerous world if we dont significantly curb our emissions
                                              immediately.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
