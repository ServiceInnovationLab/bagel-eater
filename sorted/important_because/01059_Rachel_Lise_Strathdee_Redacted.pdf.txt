A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is as a country and as a society we need to transition to a climate
important because...                          change friendly approach as soon as possible. its the way of life for
                                              the present and future.government needs to guide and actively

                                              support this change. the sooner we change old habits and employ
                                              new ones the better. if we are to have a chance of minimizing the
                                              devastating impacts of climate change on our natural and built
                                              environments.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
