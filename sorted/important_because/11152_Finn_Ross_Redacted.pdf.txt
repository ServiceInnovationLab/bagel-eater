A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is It effects everything, including over 10 million people who will be
important because...                          displaced by flooding in Bangladesh in the coming 10 years. And the
                                              10s of thousands of people living in Kiribati our pacific neighbour

                                              who's homes are drowning where I visited last week and heard how
                                              desperate they are. Also the hit to the global food supply amongst
                                              many other things.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              The profound effect on global ecosystems and systems can not be
                                              underestimated.
