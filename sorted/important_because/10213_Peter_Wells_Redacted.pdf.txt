A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We hold our future in our hands & will set an example for the Pacific
important because...                          region. We cannot go halfway to a beautiful, healthy, and sustainable
                                              future!

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                              international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice on ecological, social,
                                              cultural, and economic context, but does not make final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              More local conversations and updates on the national progress would
                                              be great. It made a huge difference to us in Christchurch that MoE
                                              came to visit in June! Please keep it up.
