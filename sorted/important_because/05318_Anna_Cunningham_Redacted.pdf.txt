A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is we only have one planet earth. It is our responsibility as caretakers
important because...                          of this planet to protect it so that future generations can thrive on
                                              this planet. Human-induced climate change is will have a very

                                              tangible impact on our lives. We can either carry on with business-
                                              as-usual, with our heads in the sand, and make no change, or we can
                                              start to assess our impact and act to mitigate it. The Zero Carbon Act
                                              will make it easier for action to be taken to reduce NZ's carbon
                                              emissions.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                              international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
