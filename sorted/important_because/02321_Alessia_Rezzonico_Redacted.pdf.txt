A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Because without it there would be a lot of talk and ideas but no
important because...                          action. The government needs to act, and quick, as we do not have
                                              much time to change what is happening to our home. We can

                                              change house, but we cannot change planet. New Zealand has the
                                              opportunity to set an example for countries around the world, the
                                              opportunity to be bold and listen to the people. Governments need to
                                              set example for their citizens and ask them to act. A climate law
                                              needs to happen for the sake of the generations to come. Nobody

                                              wants to see their home destroyed by floods, droughts, sea level
                                              rising, pollution, poison, ... To avoid this to happen we have to act
                                              now, not tomorrow.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
