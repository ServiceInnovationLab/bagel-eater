A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is we have left it late in the day to make a real difference to our
important because...                           society. I look at my daughter and wonder what world would be left
                                               for her to grow up in, contribute to and live within. I note from

                                               discussions with my parents that times are changing and that social
                                               equity and intergenerational equity are still playing second fiddle to
                                               greed and one-upmanship. As such, the Act is critical to enabling us
                                               to make a real and sustained change that can help us continued
                                               prosperity and opportunity for all.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                               international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
