A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I live in a seaside community and notice the changes, I have
important because...                           grandchildren whose future I worry about.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               Some ideas: To quickly reduce the release of methane ban factory
                                               farming immediately - chickens, pigs, cattle and increase taxes on all
                                               animal products (food) using the same system we use for tobacco -
                                               driving consumers to healthier plant based alternatives. Meat/dairy

                                               tax to directly fund the health system.
                                               Tax incentives for owners of steep land to replant with native trees
                                               and plants .
                                               Tax incentives for marginal land owners not suitable for horticulture
                                               to be planted with a mix of native and or forestry trees. All farms

                                               with mycroplasma bovis should be assisted to sustainable farming
                                               without animals. Increase tax on all fuel and use it to fund rail, public
                                               transport and cycling.
