A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I want to raise my children in a world where this country and other
important because...                           countries around the world are as beautiful, if not more beautiful
                                               than they are today. I want them to know what a polar bear is, and

                                               be able to see one if they grow to be adventurers. I want my future
                                               grandchildren or great grandchildren to visit my hometown one day
                                               and see the special places from my childhood. Sadly, I am from a
                                               small village called Mapua which is likely to be partially underwater
                                               by then. I want all future generations to live in a country without fear

                                               of increasingly frequent weather disasters, without pollution, and
                                               without dwindling resources. This should not be too much to ask of a
                                               country with the current ability to eliminate carbon emissions.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
