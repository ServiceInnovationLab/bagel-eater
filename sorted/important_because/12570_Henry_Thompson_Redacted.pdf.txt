A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Not a big fan of Wall-E style environmental apocalypses. Would really
important because...                          like to continue enjoying breathing oxygen. And because New
                                              Zealand needs to reclaim its status as a moral leader on a global

                                              stage, not just a passive, spineless spectator. This sends a clear
                                              signal about our leadership in the area.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
Further comments                              I cannot for the life of me understand why this is still being debated.

                                              Sort it now before the legacy the current ruling generation leaves is
                                              one of exclusive destruction and selfish consumption at the neglect
                                              of every generation to follow.
