A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is current and future politicians (across the board, regardless of party)
important because...                          need to be held to account for formulating a just and fair and
                                              seriously-considered plan for reducing emissions and helping New

                                              Zealanders adapt to the major (and what could be catastrophic)
                                              impacts of climate change on our environment; on our lives and that
                                              of future generations; and on the health and survival of our planet as
                                              a whole. New Zealand has always been at the forefront of political,
                                              social and environmental change and Kiwis can again now lead the

                                              way in supporting and creating such a law that will guarantee smart,
                                              sustainable transport; thriving towns and cities; and clean,
                                              renewable energy both for our nation and for the world.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-life gases,
                                              while reducing short-life gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              comprised of experts, that provides advice but does not ultimately
                                              make final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
