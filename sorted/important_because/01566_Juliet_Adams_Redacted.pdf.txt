A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is important because every
important because...                           citizen needs to be educated and encouraged (even forced
                                               financially if necessary) to reduce their own demand for energy that

                                               has been produced in ways that create emissions that speed up the
                                               rate of climate change. It is not enough to focus on finding ways to
                                               maintain the supply of energy to meet current demand. Demand
                                               must be reduced, just as people have in the past become used to
                                               taking such action as a result of wars and disasters.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible. It is necessary to reduce methane emissions promptly,
                                               especially fossil methane from mining etc, in order to reduce world
                                               temperatures more quickly and so reduce the serious consequences

                                               of over-heating the planet. This target should be reached by
                                               reducing our own emissions and not by using international carbon
                                               credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               representing all the parties currently in government, as well as
                                               experts in this field, to provide advice to the government, which
                                               makes the actual decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               I believe that a system of short-term budgets for emissions
                                               reduction, as used by the UK, should be included in NZ, but with a 6-
                                               year cycle, not a 5-year cycle. With our 3-year electoral cycle, every
                                               elected parliament must be involved and accountable for these
                                               short-term budgets.
