A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is It's important because I don't want future generations to live with
important because...                          unnecessary volatile weather catastrophes. I don't want the oceans
                                              to overheat and die. I want clean air to be a given in Aotearoa. I hope

                                              for for us to do our part on a global scale. I want my young nieces to
                                              grow up able to enjoy the beauty of their country and planet. I worry
                                              about what living conditions will be like for my nieces when they are
                                              older. I don't want them to have to fear for their survival because of
                                              climate change.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                              international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
