 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is we aren't doing enough to deal with climate change. So many people
 important because...                          including myself are aware of the issue, but because it isn't directly
                                               impacting us *now* we are just ignoring it. People need pressure and

                                               reason to be making change, as we have shown over the past many
                                               years that we aren't doing anything without it. Buying international
                                               carbon credits isn't a sustainable approach as they are going to get
                                               more expensive. It also isn't the right approach- we should be
                                               making efforts to deal with the problem, not paying others to fix

                                               things for us. I am scared but hopeful for the future. Goals like this
                                               help me be more hopeful and less scared.

 Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

 Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
