 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We certainly need the carbon zero act plus a plan on how to get
 important because...                          there by 2050. If we don't start now time will pass us by. I would like
                                               to think we could do it sooner.

 Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                               international carbon credits.
 Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

 Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

 Further comments                              Would be real good if landlords saw the investment potential in in
                                               adding solar panels to rental properties, after all if it's if it's an
                                               investment on their own homes surely it's an investment in any

                                               property they own.
