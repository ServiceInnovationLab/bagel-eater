A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I live in dunedin on the coast, in South Dundin. The changing climate
important because...                          is a major issue as the rising sea level is causing major flooding with
                                              any major weather event. There is a lot of tourism on the Otago

                                              Peninsula that that is impacted adversely by the closure of the
                                              Portobello during extreme high tides.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2040. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
Further comments                              Carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide are all greenhouse gases

                                              and should be included in the zero carbon act.
