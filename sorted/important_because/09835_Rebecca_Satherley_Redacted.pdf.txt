A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is we need to take action and do all that we can to ensure that our
important because...                           future generations can also enjoy the amazing planet we all call
                                               home. I believe we have a duty to behave sustainably and not

                                               squander our children's future.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts nominated by their peers, and provides
                                               advice that must be considered prior to embarking on actions that
                                               might pose a risk of adverse effects upon the environment, but does
                                               not make final decisions. I believe that this commission should

                                               regularly publish progress, and should be free to do this without
                                               political interference.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               Any and all lobbying, lobbying funds, and identities behind those
                                               lobbyists should be made public whenever the outcome of the
                                               lobbying may result in negative impacts upon the environment. I

                                               believe the public should have access to all the information including
                                               vested interests in order to be able to make fully informed
                                               submissions based on facts on these matters.
