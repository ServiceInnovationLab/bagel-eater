A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is The ultimate effects of climate change are too devastating to
important because...                          imagine living through. At this point we MUST do everything we can
                                              to minimize the damage to our earth so that we and our children, the

                                              plants and animals around us are able to live without the terror of
                                              hurricanes, rising water levels, floods, tornadoes, drought, forest
                                              fires, water contamination and shortages, food shortages,
                                              displacement of numbers of people, eventually wars over limited
                                              resources. Itâ€™s frightening, and if we do nothing the lives of those left

                                              to deal with it will not be as blessed as ours have been.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              We must take steps now, and voluntary steps by very few individuals
                                              is not enough. Government legislations is essential.
