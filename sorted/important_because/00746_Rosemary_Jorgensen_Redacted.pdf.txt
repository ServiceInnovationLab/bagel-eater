A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We need a planet that we can live on. It will be OK for my generation,
important because...                         but I can't think that long term, it could be disastrous if something is
                                             not done now. We need to do a lot more than what is proposed at the

                                             moment

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                             international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                             The cost of doing nothing is already apparent, in the fact of more
                                             frequent storms, wild weather, etc. I agree the cost of doing

                                             'something' is also a lot, but could help in the long term.
