A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Mr Trump is alienating the American people and painting them into a
important because...                          corner that may make them reliant on him and his outdated
                                              philosophy. Our kids need us to get started in the opposite direction

                                              as soon as possible so we can make strides into improving the
                                              environment before it’s too late and we then have to face their
                                              questions about why we didn’t do enough when we had the chance.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              Maori raise their children to be guardians of the environment, we
                                              should all do the same, it makes perfect sense to protect the air you
                                              breathe and the land and water on which we rely.
