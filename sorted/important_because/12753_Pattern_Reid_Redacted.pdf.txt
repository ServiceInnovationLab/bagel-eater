A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We need to use all the tools we can including legislation to ensure
important because...                          we meet our emissions reductions targets! This legislation will signal
                                              to fellow NZ'ers and other countries that our government takes

                                              climate action seriously and is actually acting upon their
                                              international obligations. I also strongly support the inclusion of
                                              adaptation plans in the Act as 2/3rds of NZ'ers may be affected by
                                              predicted sea level rise and this issue needs a proactive approach if
                                              we are to avoid the loss of infrastructure, homes and potentially lives

                                              in affected areas.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
