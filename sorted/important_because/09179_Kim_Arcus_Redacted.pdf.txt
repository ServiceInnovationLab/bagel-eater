A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Family - I want a world and country that my children and future
important because...                          generations can live safely in.
                                              Business, I want a country that has a sustainable long term business

                                              path, and not the current one on a trajectory to an increasingly
                                              hazardous and costly future through necessary mitigations and
                                              increasing natural hazards
                                              Globally - for us to help show the world this is possible. We need
                                              early adopters to help shift the rest of the world. We also need to do

                                              it for our more vulnerable Pacific neighbours who are more
                                              vulnerable to natural disasters and sea level rise.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
