A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is The potential benefits for the next generation of New Zealanders are
important because...                           huge, as is the damage that will result if we do not act. To the extent
                                               possible, the focus should be on the industries of the future, which

                                               will make strong contributions to New Zealand's economy in a
                                               carbon zero world. Policy should not be dictated by those who see it
                                               as in their interest to delay change for as long as possible.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not only by
                                               using international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               It is important that clear signals are given as early as possible to
                                               enable communities and businesses to plan for the impact and
                                               opportunities of emission reduction policies. The large health
                                               benefits of cleaner air, notably in congested areas of Auckland,
                                               should get much greater attention than currently.
