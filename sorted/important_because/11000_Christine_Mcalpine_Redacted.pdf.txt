A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We have an economic system based on growth and consumption. It
important because...                          does not work. A circular economy is required and a mentality of
                                              contentment and creativity rather than materialism and

                                              consumption.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              Stop allowing non-recyclable materials into the country. Create a
                                              circular economy where the producers of goods are responsible for

                                              creating a recycling pathway that stops landfilling. I

                                              Organic farming should be developed as good topsoil is a carbon
                                              sink. stop importing artificial fertilisers, stop over-stocking, stop

                                              using pristine land for dairy expansion. Find balance and stability
