A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Our world is going to suffer badly from continued increases in
important because...                           pollution, in particular fossil fuel gases, if we continue to release
                                               those more and more.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                               international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               Please select one uniform, consistent carbon footprint calculator for
                                               every individual and business to complete in order to 1) make
                                               everyone aware of their personal impact and 2)have a consistent

                                               measure of the total impact from our country. Repeat this process
                                               annually, so that individuals and groups can be monitored on their
                                               progress towards zero-carbon. There are plenty of calculators
                                               available (Google: "carbon footprint calculator nz"), but there should
                                               be one consistent process to measure the individual contributions.

                                               Where possible the quality of the responses should be checked
                                               against known recordings of the outputs measured by individual,
                                               such as power bills, numbers of cattle etc.
