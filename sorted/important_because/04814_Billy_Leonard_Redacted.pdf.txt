A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Ecological reparations must be enshrined by law in order to enable
important because...                         the changes necessary to avoid our destruction -- especially in a
                                             country which is, per human population, one of the most culpable on

                                             Earth because of its animal agriculture.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                             international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support provisions for a programme of re-training animal farmers
                                             toward crop-farming.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi to the extent that the primary goals of the Act are not

                                             compromised; ensures a just transition for workers and communities;
                                             and avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
