A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I believe that if we fail to act on this now the planet will be very
important because...                          limited in it's ability to support life as we know it. The consequences
                                              of this will fall hardest on future generations and those in vulnerable

                                              situations such as our Pacific neighbours in low lying areas. It is
                                              totally unethical to sit back and enjoy the worlds resources and allow
                                              this to happen.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
