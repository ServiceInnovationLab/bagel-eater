A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is The window of opportunity to stabilise atmospheric warming gas
important because...                           levels is very small and the time is NOW. Very proud of this
                                               government for actually The window of opportunity to stabilise

                                               atmospheric warming gas levels is very narrow. The consequences of
                                               failing to do so are unthinkable and the time to prevent the
                                               unthinkable is NOW.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               Very proud of this government for actually leading on this and other
                                               issues ( eg therapeutic jurisprudence, education review, health
                                               targets review)
