A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Humans have already caused more damage to our precious planet
important because...                         than we can repair. NZ has n opportunity to be an environmental
                                             leader, but we have (in the last decade) been embarrassingly slack

                                             in our environmental care.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                             international carbon credits. It is also important to be open to new
                                             research and adapt our efforts if greater effort is needed.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
Further comments                             This Act is one necessary step in the right direction. NZ needs to take

                                             meaningful action to minimise climate change NOW.
