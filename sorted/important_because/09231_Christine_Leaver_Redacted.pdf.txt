A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is All the expert assessments I've seen (IMF, OECD, World Bank, UN
important because...                          FAO and others) show that unmitigated climate change will be a
                                              disaster for the world economy. I don't want to witness the economic

                                              loss, mass migration and insecurity associated with such an
                                              outcome.

Long-term target                              As a relatively rich nation, NZ must show leadership. That means
                                              reducing NZ's greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050.
                                              Furthermore, it would be irresponsible to put the responsibility on
                                              others' shoulders by using international carbon credits. So: we cut

                                              our own emissions.
Climate Commission                            There should be an independent Climate Commission that is made

                                              up of experts and provides advice, but does not make final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation to rising sea level and increasingly
                                              frequent adverse weather events being included in the Zero Carbon
                                              Act.

Climate justice                               There's no escaping from the reality that minimising emissions will
                                              entail some hardship and sacrifice. The less-well-off should not suffer
                                              unduly. Those of us (individuals and corporates) who are relatively

                                              wealthy should shoulder the lion's share of the economic burden.
Further comments                              Nothing like this has ever happened before, at least not on a global

                                              scale. We either grow up and tackle it, or our kids will suffer.
