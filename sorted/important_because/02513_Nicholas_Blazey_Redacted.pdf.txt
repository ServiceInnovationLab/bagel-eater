A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is It scares me how noticeable the effects of climate change are. As a
important because...                          sailor and a surfer I’ve noticed more violent weather patterns and
                                              native trees that should be heathy drying off. I’ll be having kids in a

                                              few years and it’s worrying thinking about bad the effects of climate
                                              change will be for them. Everyone needs to make a solid
                                              commitment including the government and I 100% support this Zero
                                              Carbon Act.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducidng total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
