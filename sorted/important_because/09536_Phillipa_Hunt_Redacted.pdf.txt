A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is important because it means
important because...                          that as a country we are taking positive steps towards ensuring the
                                              there is a good future for our planet and all its species, including

                                              humans. In the past New Zealand has lead the way globally in
                                              environmental reform but we have been slow in our response to
                                              Climate Change. As a country we need to make a strong stand,
                                              leading the way once again and showing the world that if we work
                                              together we can make a positive change in relation to climate

                                              change.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
