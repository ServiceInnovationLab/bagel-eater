A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Climate change is continuing to destroying our planet. As economies
important because...                         grew so did human greed and justification to take whatever we want
                                             from our earths resources without ramification. The only way to curb

                                             this greed and prompt people to move to new earth friendly ways of
                                             living, working, trading etc that is not based on greed at the expense
                                             of our planet is to put a law in place and follow through.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                             international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
