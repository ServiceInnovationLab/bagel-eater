A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is
important because...                         Existential crisis

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                             international carbon credits or any other international offsetting

                                             scheme.
Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                             that is made up of experts and has the ability to prosecute, warn and
                                             interact with relevant participants under its mandate. Like the FMA
                                             but helping enforcing climate change law through an open dialogue
                                             with industry.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                             avoids passing on all costs (both explicit and implicit) to future
                                             generations.
