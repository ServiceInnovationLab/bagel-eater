A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is A CLIMATE law like the Zero Carbon Act is important because we
important because...                          need to start measuring, qualititive and quantitive gains from
                                              different TYPES of trees, and looking at their value. The air we

                                              breathe needs to be cleaned, honestly .... the tarata or lemon wood
                                              makes you feel refreshed, invigorated - oxygenating the air around
                                              you as you walk in regenerative forest/bush. (like Dn townbelt) The
                                              Ngahere (common name for bush) translates as "bindings" - the way
                                              we exchange oxygen & CO2.....other trees are less effective at

                                              exchange and create their own problems, like releasing tannin from
                                              pines or kapok in town plantings.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
