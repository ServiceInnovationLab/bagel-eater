A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is important because we need
important because...                          a collective multiparty vision of how to stop and reverse the
                                              disastrous impacts of global warming. It is vital because entrenched

                                              vested interests particularly in the political, energy, commercial and
                                              agricultural sectors have no mechanism of ethics that can curb the
                                              excessive CO2 production that they currently depend on. By setting
                                              up a non-partisan, evidence-based, mutually assured path to zero
                                              carbon futures our entire society can make a fair and just

                                              contribution to global action for sustainable futures.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
