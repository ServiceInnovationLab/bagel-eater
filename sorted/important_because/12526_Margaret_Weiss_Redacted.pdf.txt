A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is we are a people of the South Pacific, many of whom in New Zealand
important because...                          live in coastal areas. We have neighbours who live on smaller islands
                                              than our North or South Island, also in coastal areas. This is an

                                              integral part of our lifestyle and our heritage and one which I
                                              consider important to maintain. We wish to see the most ambitious
                                              plans put into action to prevent climate change threatening the
                                              safety of this lifestyle. We wish to allow future generations to know
                                              the same privilege as we have known and to view the sea as our

                                              friend and not an enemy susceptible of washing away our homes and
                                              drowning our people.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
