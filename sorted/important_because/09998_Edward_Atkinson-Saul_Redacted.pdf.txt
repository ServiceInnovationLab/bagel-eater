A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I feel like this is self evident. We're 7.2 billion people in a locked
important because...                          room. We all know what happens when too many people are in a
                                              locked room and one has a dodgy tummy. We murder them, or we all

                                              suffocate.
                                              Maybe not murder. Change their diet.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
Further comments                              Please don't put me on a watch list because I mentioned murder. I've

                                              been watching Jim Jeffries.
