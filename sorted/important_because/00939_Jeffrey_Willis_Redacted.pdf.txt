A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Climate change is the most significant long-term threat facing
important because...                           humanity. This a question of the future habitability of our planet -
                                               and in that equation all of us alive today are in the minority. Those

                                               who will come after us deserve a planet which can support them, like
                                               the one that we got.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of scientific experts.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation to issues like sea level rise being
                                               included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
Further comments                               New Zealand has not been a leader when it comes to climate

                                               change. This is our chance to change that.
