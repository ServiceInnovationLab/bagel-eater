 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is It is the future of our world and our existence as the human race.
 important because...                          Strong scientific evidence is telling us that we have a short time to
                                               act otherwise the damage to this planet is irreversible, it is time we

                                               listen! I want a future life for myself and my kids where they see
                                               coral reefs and live in a stable environment without threat.

 Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

 Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
 Further comments                              We desperately need a plastic free NZ like we had a generation ago.

                                               We need legislation to ban plastic bags, pay coffee cups, plastic
                                               cutlery, we need food packaged in whole bulk foods easy free from
                                               creating an ever growing plastic waste land.
