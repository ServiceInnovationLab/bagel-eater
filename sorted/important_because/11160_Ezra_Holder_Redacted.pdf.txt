A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is This issue is not going away. It is so important that we start taking it
important because...                          seriously and implement an actionable plan to limit our greenhouse
                                              gas emissions. It is refreshing to see legislation being presented that

                                              will provide leadership in this area. I love New Zealand and I want to
                                              give my children the same opportunities that I was privileged enough
                                              to have, growing up here!

                                              Please think of future generations and take this issue seriously.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                              international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions. I think that it's important for the recommendations
                                              provided by the Commission to be

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids simply passing on the costs to future generations.
