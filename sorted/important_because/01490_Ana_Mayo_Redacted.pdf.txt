A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is The earth is a most beautiful host when we allow her to be, and if we
important because...                           treat it like garbage, polluting, pillaging, littering.. then our poor
                                               descendants will be the ones who have to suffer in a world where

                                               everything is toxic. Lifespans will decrease. Health and well being will
                                               decrease. This is just from a human perspective. Then there is also
                                               the eco-system including all other living creatures in the world. They
                                               all play a part in the world, and some of them are necessary for our
                                               own survival.


                                               I want a beautiful world that will thrive and flourish as long as it
                                               stands. Not just for humans, but for all living creatures.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

                                               What are we if not adaptable? Things change, and change must
                                               always be possible. But it is important that any change always takes
                                               into account sustainability, otherwise where will things be 100, 200
                                               years down the track. A scary thought, if change is not sustainable.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
Further comments                               Every human should be accountable, from the big corporations who

                                               have profit as their number one target, right down to our personal
                                               rubbish bins, houses and back yards.
