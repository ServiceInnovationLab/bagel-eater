A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is New Zealand has to show it is a responsible member of the global
important because...                          community. This requires balance in all our ecosystems and overall
                                              environment. Sustainability in industry and agriculture and within our

                                              society at large.
                                              There are already too many examples of a lateral approach to
                                              sustainability in New Zealand and the use of international carbon
                                              credits is one of them. We must take responsibility for what we
                                              produce and in what we consume.


                                              New Zealand still has an enviable reputation within the international
                                              community and along with our environment it will perish were we not
                                              to show our intent in regulating against further degradation.





                                              New Zealand is

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              The post war generations have already created through their own
                                              excess an enormous cost to future generations and now we must all
                                              take responsibility.
