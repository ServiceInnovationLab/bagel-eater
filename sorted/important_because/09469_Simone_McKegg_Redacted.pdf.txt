A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Because our natural environment is our future and only be arresting
important because...                         carbon can we begin to stabilise the precious elements that we have
                                             and start to rebuild them. New Zealand should be a world leader in

                                             this as we have the physical isolation to show how it can be done.
                                             Instead we are dragging behind hanging our heads in shame. I want
                                             to hold my head up and be proud of what we have done and to look
                                             forward to a brighter future of environmental stability.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                             international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
