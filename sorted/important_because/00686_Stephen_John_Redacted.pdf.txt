A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Anthropomorphic climate change is happening - and too quickly. We
important because...                         must act - each one of us - to do our bit to reduce emissions and our
                                             Government must act too. The Zero Carbon Act is a good

                                             commitment for NZ to make. Thus I support it.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                             international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
