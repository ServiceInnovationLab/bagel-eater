A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We need to implement a serious change in order to stand any
important because...                          chance of impacting the climate change trend that we have already
                                              set in motion. Half measures at this stage are as good as useless, no

                                              more than expensive token gestures. New Zealanders are known for
                                              their gutsiness and willingness to take on a challenge if necessary.
                                              Lets take on this one and show the world we mean business :)

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions. We need to be able to trust the experts on this one

                                              and to listen and implement where possible the changes they may
                                              suggest.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.
                                              We need to have a plan for the future that includes the inevitable
                                              changes we are unable to prevent.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
Further comments                              This is too important to sweep under the carpet. Listen now so future

                                              generations don't remember us with disdain and disgust that we
                                              knew we had a chance but did too little, but with pride that we
                                              fought damn hard (and maybe even changed a thing or two along
                                              the way!).
