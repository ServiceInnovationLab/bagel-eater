A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is There is a need to have a national policy to support and coordinate
important because...                          the actions required at all levels of NZ society to bring about
                                              changes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate their

                                              effect on global warming.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              The urgency of the situation cannot be emphasized enough. For too
                                              long the debate has been confused and protracted by climate

                                              change deniers. The actual increasess in global temperatures and
                                              extreme weather events are now providing clear evidence that the
                                              predicted changes are happening. There is an urgent need for action.
                                              A Zero Carbon Act is needed to empower both individuals and the
                                              state to make the changes required.
