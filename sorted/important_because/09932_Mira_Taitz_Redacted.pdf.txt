A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is It’s utterly selfish to not act when our children are going to have to
important because...                          pick up the pieces. Nz should lead the world not be lagging behind.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050 but I would prefer sooner. I also support

                                              taking a science-based approach to ensure our efforts to reduce
                                              emissions are as impactful as possible: we should aim for negative
                                              levels of long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases to
                                              sustainable levels. This target should be reached by reducing our
                                              own emissions and not by using international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              2050 is such a long time away - it’s the absolute minimum we can
                                              do. By 2050 so many of today’s decision makers will be gone already
                                              and we are leaving a problem for the next generation. Zero carbon
                                              by 2050 is the absolute minimum we should do and this law should

                                              be made harder to repeal than other laws as our electoral cycle is
                                              robbing future generations of the right to quality of life.
