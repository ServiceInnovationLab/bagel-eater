A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Climate change is happening a lot more rapidly than originally
important because...                         predicted. We and the whole world must act quickly for our sake and
                                             future generations. We are responsible for caring for the earth, our

                                             planet.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                             international carbon credits.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                             We all need to take individual responsibility; every little bit / action
                                             helps. Change and pollution are so obvious now. No way can we
                                             deny it. We need to act.
