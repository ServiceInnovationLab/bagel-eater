A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Climate change, and what we do about it, will define us, our era, and
important because...                         ultimately the global legacy we leave for future generations. It's
                                             important to consider the intergenerational effects of climate

                                             change. NZ economy is highly vulnerable to climate change, yet NZ
                                             policy makers have struggled to develop a coherent and
                                             environmentally effective domestic climate change policy. I hope
                                             that a Zero Carbon Act will manifest the change required.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                             international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
