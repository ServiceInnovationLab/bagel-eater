 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Global warming is increasingly a worry for wildlife and sealife, and
 important because...                          can impact native New Zealand wildlife, leading to reduction of
                                               populations. New Zealand is seen as clean and green, and in order

                                               for that to continue, the Zero Carbon Act can help to maintain that
                                               image, as well as reducing the rate of melting of the glaciers, which
                                               are a particular interest to tourists. Climate change is causing
                                               changes in weather, leading to several natural disasters. Some of
                                               this can be reversed by reducing our carbon footprint. New Zealand

                                               is a beautiful country, and I want to continue to enjoy it and allow
                                               future generations to enjoy it too.

 Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

 Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
