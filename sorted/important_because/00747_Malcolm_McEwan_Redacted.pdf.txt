A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Unless those of us living now make things better, mokopuna and
important because...                          future descendants will not have the choices we have had. We must
                                              all start sacrificing things we have taken for granted like meat and

                                              air travel to make an impact for future generations

Long-term target                              I enthusiastically support the most ambitious target of reducing total
                                              greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a
                                              science-based approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions
                                              are as impactful as possible: we should aim for negative levels of
                                              long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable

                                              levels. This target should be reached by reducing our own emissions,
                                              making lifestyle sacrifices, using renewable energy sources, leaving
                                              coal, oil and gas in the ground, and not by using international carbon
                                              credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
