A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We need this climate law to make sure that both public and private
important because...                          investment is made in a timely way towards a low emissions and
                                              zero carbon economy. The change is profound across the whole of

                                              society and this should be under-pinned by climate law.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that has to take a leadership role in making sure New Zealand
                                              undertakes its global responsibilities in reducing carbon emissions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              New Zealand was respected 50 years ago in taking a lead in
                                              renewable energy. We can do this again if we have a strong climate

                                              law and the willingness to fund both publicly and privately the
                                              innovation needed. The engineering profession, especially process
                                              engineering, has a huge role to play to lead the innovation required.
                                              This is a critical missing piece in the development of climate change
                                              policy.
