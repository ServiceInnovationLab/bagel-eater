A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is climate underpins everything about the way we live: how we work,
important because...                          where we build, how we invest, everything. Climate change
                                              exacerbates inequality, having the biggest and worst impact on the

                                              people least responsible for it. It also places the cost and burden on
                                              our kids and our kids' kids -- again, the people least responsible for
                                              it. The sooner we take action, the better our chances of having an
                                              effective response.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
