 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Climate scientists have been warning of the dangers of increasing
 important because...                          carbon levels for decades. Since then the issue has continually
                                               gotten worse and worse, with little action taken to seriously tackle

                                               the issue. We are now on the brink of it being to late to make a real
                                               difference for the future. Ambitious, inspiring, and decisive action
                                               needs to be taken NOW, or better, yesterday, to make a real
                                               commitment to being Carbon Neutral. The time for weak targets has
                                               long been passed. We NEED to be carbon neutral to ensure we

                                               minimise the serious impacts of climate change.

 Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

 Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
