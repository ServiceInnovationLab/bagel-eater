A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Climate change is one of the most serious issues our generation is
important because...                         facing. Multiple studies have shown the negative effects of fossil
                                             fuels on the environment and how this is destroying our planet.

                                             There needs to be a set in stone legislation that will see New Zealand
                                             strive towards a greener future that surpasses individual political
                                             parties agendas

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                             international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
