 A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is The science tells us that we are destroying the sustainability of our
 important because...                          life giving resources like air and water.

 Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

 Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                               final decisions.

 Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

 Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

 Further comments                              Time is of the essence here, and much of this work should have been
                                               done "yesterday". Hopefully we are not too late in rectifying our bad
                                               habits in destroying the only home we have. Migration to other
                                               planets is not a option for a very long time!! Please take this through

                                               the legislative process as a priority. Many thanks for your attention.
