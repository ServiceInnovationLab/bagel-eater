A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is whilst we might have to accept that the planet will have to endure
important because...                           many changes that will alter ecosystems and its natural beauty (sea
                                               and landscape), it is the political and economic stability of the world

                                               that will be most in jeopardy from the many natural disasters that
                                               will occur as climate change accelerates. For this reason, the world
                                               will be a less safe and secure place unless there is more agreement
                                               to reduce carbon emissions and increase carbon absorption.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.
                                               That adaptation should not subsidize breakwaters for individual
                                               properties in coastal areas but should concentrate on protecting
                                               public access to the coast and protecting public infrastructure such
                                               as roads, potable water supplies,and parks/reserves. The adaptation

                                               plan should identify areas that would be prone to flooding or land
                                               instability and prevent further development in them. IT should also
                                               look at long-term resettlement options for those in hazardous areas.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               Having helped plant more than 20,000 trees in what is now a
                                               registered Permanent Forest Sink, I would like to see more incentives

                                               through the ETS for variations on the permanent forest initiatives
                                               such as linear plantings on wasteland.
