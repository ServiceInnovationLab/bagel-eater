A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is it can make or break the future of human life on earth. Never mind
important because...                          that New Zealand only accounts for a small proportion of global
                                              emissions. Our emissions per capita are right up there with the

                                              worst. As a prosperous but polluting nation, New Zealand has a
                                              responsibility to take a leadership role on climate change mitigation.
                                              If not us, who? If not now, when?

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              History will remember us all for our response to this challenge more
                                              than anything else. Be bold on behalf of future generations.
