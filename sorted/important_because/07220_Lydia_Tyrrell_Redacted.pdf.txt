A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is climate change is already creating horrible consequences as storms
important because...                          become more and more devastating. We need strong action now if
                                              we want to live in a safe world.

Long-term target                              I strongly support the most ambitious target of reducing total

                                              greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a
                                              science-based approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions
                                              are as impactful as possible: we should aim for negative levels of
                                              long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable
                                              levels. This target should be reached by reducing our own emissions

                                              and not by using international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                            I strongly support the establishment of an independent Climate

                                              Commission that is made up of experts and provides advice, but
                                              does not make final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I strongly support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero
                                              Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              Go hard please!
