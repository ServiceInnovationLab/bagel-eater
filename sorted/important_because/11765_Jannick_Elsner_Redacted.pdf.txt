A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is my children should still be able to enjoy all the freedoms I relish,
important because...                         without being restricted by an environmental breakdown.

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                             must be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                             international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                             To make Aotearoas transport system carbon neutral I suggest the
                                             revival of the pubic transport sector, especially railway connections
                                             around New Zealand. A better train infrastructure, powered by
                                             renewable energies would not only make transport more affordable
                                             but would further boost tourism.
