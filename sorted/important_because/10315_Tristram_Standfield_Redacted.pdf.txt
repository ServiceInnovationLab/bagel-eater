A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Why the hell is this even a question? Long term, it's a choice
important because...                          between lowering the carbon emissions or letting them rise to the
                                              point where we can't reverse it and allowing our planet to be

                                              ecologically ruined. I'd rather lower them than face that.

Long-term target                              I whole heartedly support the incredibly ambitious goal of reducing
                                              total greenhouse gases to net 0 by 2050. Additionally, I support
                                              following a science-based approach to ensure our efforts to lower
                                              emissions are as impactful as possible: we should aim for negative
                                              levels of long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases to

                                              sustainable levels. This target should be reached by reducing our
                                              own emissions and not by using international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
