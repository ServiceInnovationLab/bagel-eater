A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is We have no alternative. There is no back up plan if greenhouse gas
important because...                          levels push us beyond the tipping point. Temperatures are record-
                                              breaking, vast amounts of ice are breaking off and melting,

                                              threatening polar species like the polar bear and even more
                                              seriously, causing rising sea levels all over the world. The planet is
                                              experiencing many more severe events, which have been hugely
                                              destructive, resulting in the loss of human and animals lives and
                                              destruction of houses and food crops.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                              international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
