A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I think the Zero Carbon Act is super important as our carbon
important because...                          emissions are a big part of global warming, and is partly responsible
                                              for greenhouse gases and the rising temperatures. Therefore, by

                                              introducing a law such as the Zero Carbon Act, we are majorly
                                              reducing New Zealand's part in global warming and climate change.
                                              With many more countries introducing an act such as this, it is a
                                              great start to reducing emissions world wide, and by New Zealand
                                              taking a stand, we are showing what a forward thinking, innovative

                                              nation we are. We had the idea of a Zero Carbon Act from what the
                                              U.K had done, so now maybe other small countries such as us will be
                                              influenced on what we do, and create and Act of their own.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful

                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o

                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations. The
