A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Not just this Country but our World needs to have a 'Zero Carbon
important because...                           Act'. What sort of future are we bringing children into? What about
                                               the children's, children? We made this mess & it's up to 'us' as

                                               individuals, communities, Countries & part of the Earth we all live on
                                               to make changes NOW. Climate change affects everyone & every-
                                               living thing around us. It affects our health, the food we eat, the air
                                               we breath & our oceans & all that live in, on & around them.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations. We need to make
                                               sure that those that follow after we have gone have clean air, fresh
                                               water, healthy food to grow & eat. Keep our Rivers, Seas & Oceans

                                               clean with abundant sea life living in clean water.
Further comments                               As a Grandmother I worry about my Grandchildren's future & the

                                               future of their children. I want to rest peacefully knowing we have
                                               done our best to give following generations the things we took for
                                               granted as children.
