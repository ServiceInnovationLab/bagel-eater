A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is I live in Fiji and I experience the effects of climate change on a daily
important because...                          basis (the temperature is rising and its getting hotter during
                                              summer). Also, the sea level is rising and affecting our low lying

                                              areas especially when there's even a slight heavy rain and many are
                                              forced to leave their homes and evacuate.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,

                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and

                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
Further comments                              I would strongly suggest this law be passed and enforced throughout

                                              the whole of NZ and also enforce this law in Fiji to help us help the
                                              earth and save lives from climate change!
