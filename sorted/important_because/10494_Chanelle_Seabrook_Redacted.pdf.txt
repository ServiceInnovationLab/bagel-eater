A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Now we (as a society) are fully aware of the consequences of carbon
important because...                          emissions and the effect that climate change will have on both the
                                              living and their surroundings, it makes absolutely no sense we would

                                              sit back and do nothing about it! An act is the only sound way to
                                              achieve significant change instantaneously, even though the efforts
                                              of many individuals nation wide are not going amiss, the bigger
                                              power needs to stand in so we can see a large change ... sooner
                                              rather than later!

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using

                                              international carbon credits.
Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission

                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
