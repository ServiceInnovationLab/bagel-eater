A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is Climate change threatens every part of our way of life. The earth
important because...                           operates on a finely balanced system which has supported human
                                               life for thousands of years. By altering this balance by emitting large

                                               amount of carbon into the atmosphere we are fundamentally
                                               threatening our current state of existence. I support this act because
                                               it's taking a preemptive step to prevent us from exceeding the
                                               earth's boundaries. By getting this act sorted now, we give ourselves
                                               enough to help transition workers out of carbon based industries

                                               without too much stress on them and their families. I also support it
                                               because it puts Aotearoa New Zealand on the map in regard to
                                               climate action and will provide pressure for other, larger emitting
                                               countries to act.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.
