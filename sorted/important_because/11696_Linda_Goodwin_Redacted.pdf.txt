A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is He Whenua, he whenua, whenua - it is all about the land we live and
important because...                         breath amidst. Without it there will be no he tangata, he tangata, he
                                             tangata. We need to act now for all and for those to come.

                                             Complacency with our environment is having a detrimental toll.
                                             Action must happen, including vigorous and immediate legislative
                                             efforts.Government and everyone are the custodians to he whenua -
                                             we need to be doing a better job - and we can! Now!

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                             international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                             Now is the time for the Zero Carban Act
