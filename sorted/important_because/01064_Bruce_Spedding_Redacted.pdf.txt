A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is It will provide a better future for ourselves, our children, following
important because...                           generations, our country and the planet. The Act will drive
                                               development in the best direction for the future with positive

                                               environmental, social and economic outcomes.

Long-term target                               I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                               gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based
                                               approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                               as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                               while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target

                                               should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                               international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                             I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                               that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make
                                               final decisions.

Adaptation                                     I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                                A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                               Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                               avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                               Economically we are dependent on commodity/primary products
                                               which could become a liability as alternative and less

                                               environmentally impacting forms of food production become more
                                               viable. We need to react now, by reducing our bio footprint and
                                               moving to quality not quantity agriculture. At the same time we
                                               should be developing our sustainability expertise with a view to
                                               becoming world experts and marketing this as well. We have long

                                               been a laboratory for economic experiments, lets use our own
                                               environment to develop expertise and sell our skills.
