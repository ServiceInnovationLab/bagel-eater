A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is If we don't act with urgency then the great extinction of the
important because...                          anthropocene will terminate our species as well. I'm almost certain of
                                              this even though many scientists such as Professor Guy MacPherson

                                              believe we are too late anyway. I hold out much hope because I
                                              believe that we do have hope if we get on with it, and perhaps the
                                              pressure of doing something will bring out the best of us should we
                                              decide to get a move on.

Long-term target                              I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                              gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                              approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                              as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                              while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                              should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                              international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                            I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                              that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                              final decisions.

Adaptation                                    I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                               A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                              Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                              avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                              I'm also looking for a change in attitude amongst those leading the
                                              way, because the danger is so great and we have too much to lose...
