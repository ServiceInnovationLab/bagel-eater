A climate law like the Zero Carbon Act is It will greatly help the preservation of New Zealand's beautiful
important because...                         natural landscapes which are also a crucial part of our economy. I am
                                             a skier and mountaineer who loves high country New Zealand and so

                                             a zero carbon act is very important in protecting our winters and
                                             glaciers that provide so much enjoyment and challenge. I want to be
                                             skiing well into the future! I want my grandkids to be able to ski in
                                             NZ!

Long-term target                             I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse
                                             gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based

                                             approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful
                                             as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases,
                                             while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. This target
                                             should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using
                                             international carbon credits.

Climate Commission                           I support the establishment of an independent Climate Commission
                                             that is made up of experts and provides advice, but does not make

                                             final decisions.

Adaptation                                   I support a plan for adaptation being included in the Zero Carbon Act.

Climate justice                              A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair in that it honours Te Tiriti o
                                             Waitangi; ensures a just transition for workers and communities; and
                                             avoids passing on the costs to future generations.

Further comments                             This is so important for our countries future and action must be
                                             taken now! I fully support this act which could not come soon
                                             enough. Protect our winters!
