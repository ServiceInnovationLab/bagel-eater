Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill






Reference no: 2443

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes




 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 I'd like to see gross 0 emissions! Set ambitious targets. Loads of trees are good, but not enough.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 Don't waste NZ money to buy foreign credits, that won't help achieve our target, just allows to pollute more.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 Making it even tighter.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Fossil fuel industry must not have a say.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Must not have conflict of interest.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
I'd like to see a few things: 1. Coal fire plants shutdown as of now (both power and other uses). Including Huntly, including Fonterra

milk drying plants! 2. Wood fire heating systems removed. No new should be sold. (winter emissions are caused by those) 3. Coal
burner heating systems removed. 4. Our current buses by no means reduce emissions. They are both extremely dirty both inside the

bus (you can smell the gases inside) and outside. Can't see how they are better than me riding in a self driving electric car (which is
probably done deal in 1-2 years). 5. I sincerely think that leading the way will do good for the planet and for our economy, the

technology solutions we are going to create is going to create far better GDP growth than predicted. 6. Regarding electricity markets
make a very simple change like Germany did: renewable energy takes priority. Renewable excludes bio energy, which has harmful
emissions. Consider that only solar and wind are 0 emission. Both geothermal and hydro are NOT 0 emission, there is no direct

emssions, though secondary emissions from biological processes (eg. bio build up in front of dams) need to be considered. Feel free
to contact me for pointers, but you'll find this in the scientific literature. 7. Take examples from Germany, they are leading the way of

transformation. 8. Develop an increased market incentive to promote electric cars.
