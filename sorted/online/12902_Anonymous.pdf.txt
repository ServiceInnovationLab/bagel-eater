Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 12902

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 Having certainty and clarity about the government's commitment to a target will help councils and businesses take more decisive and
 informed action towards reducing emissions as they do their planning.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases
 Notes

 Option 2 as a minimum. The Paris Agreement requires developed countries to do their share toward a target that offers reasonable
 hope that warming will be below 2 degrees. This means net zero longlived gases by 2050 at the latest, and preferably closer to 2040.

 The even more desirable goal of limiting temperature increase to 1.5 degrees implies a transition to net negative emissions of long-
 lived gases within the same timeframe. Current scientific views suggest that short-lived gases, at least those arising from biological
 processes, should be considered separately and that for these, stabilisation is the aim. The issue then is what is the appropriate

 stabilisation level. It is reasonable to let this be based on a recommendation from the Climate Change Commission in response to
 emerging understanding of the warming impact of different levels of stabilisation, and the effects of methane release from thawing
 permafrost. There is little doubt in current scientific discourse that the stabilisation level for biological methane would need to be well

 below current levels. Methane leakage from fossil fuel extraction and distribution should be reduced to zero by 2050 at the latest.The
 benefits of this would be wide-ranging, including enhanced water quality resulting from a shift from high-emissions agriculture to

 lower impact primary rural industries. The transition to a net zero economy is clearly a very significant challenge, but one that must be
 embraced to prevent ‘run away’ global warming and damaging climate change.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 New Zealand should make a strong and clear commitment to prioritize domestic reduction activity through new forest planting and
 other sequestration activities (e.g. soil carbon).Past experience has shown that the carbon credit approach is often largely ineffective

 in redcuing emissions, and the major danger here is that it gives a false impression of effective action, fostering complacence. There
 is also doubt abut the availability of overseas credits, given most countries would need to make significant reductions to meet their

 own targets and hence would not have large quantities of credits available for export.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes

 Businesses and councils need clear leadership and certainty about emissions targets in order to act decisively toward reducing
 emissions in their own planning. If there are major changes in scientific knowledge or international laws, agreements, or systems,
 government targets can be revised through legislative change.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes
Clause
6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

Position
Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

Notes
The third emissions budget should only be able to be changed under clearly defined exceptional circumstances defined by the

Climate Change Commission. It is crucial that new governments are limited in their powers to alter emissions budgets, given the
need for certainty, and consistent progress towards the 2050 target.



Clause

7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
The need for certainty and continuity in progress toward the target is too great.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes. Time is of the essence and clear, quantifiable direction is urgently needed. Plans should be completed witin a year of the Climate
Chenge Commission sets the budget.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Central government and local councils need to develop initiatives that incentivise businesses to reduce emissions, and councils
need to work closely with the businesses and individuals in their communities to plan in ways that meet their particular needs and
make reducing emissions a matter of improving quality of life in the community, e.g., better cycleways and excellent public transport

not only can reduce emissions, but improve well-being.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes, because th CCC can hold givernment to account, provide expert advice and support, and independently monitor progress
toward targets.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
Ultimately, councils and central government needs to act democratically and take responsibility for meeting the emissions targets.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
