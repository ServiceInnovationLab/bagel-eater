Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

David William Renison








Reference no: 1795

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 We don't need artificial targets. This is unproven science and we should not cripple our society on some poorly thought out

 hypothesis.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 We don't need a target.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Notes
 CO2 is not at at historically high levels and we should concentrate on real pollutants not sham ones like CO2.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 No

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes



 Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
No

Notes



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

We should look at the ACTUAL link 's between temp and CO2 levels not some poorly constructed computer models which have been
woefully inaccurate in their predictions. Climate change is a political construct not something based on actual science.



Clause

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

exposure to climate change risks?

No
