Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Kevin Andrew Muir








Reference no: 9163

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 A Clear statement of Government intent is the best way to ensure all sectors of society understand the commitment that needs to be
 made and the best way to ensure this is the main priority for future budget spending. Without a clear plan to avert climate change

 there is little point in focussing on other future social needs or priorities because will have a bleak and economically desperate future.
 due to the severe impact on our primary industries and land use.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 The focus on emission reduction needs to be a comprehensive one.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 We should include a focus on the development of practical small and large scale carbon sequestration projects as well as emission

 reductions. Research and development of effective torrefaction systems (or even "supertorrefaction systems; summarily the use of
 "char" processes, heating organic matter in anoxic conditions so as to create and sequester carbon using either existing stock/food
 crops or forestry including forestry slash and waste). There are significant opportunities for local primary producers and for export of

 expertise and technology in this field. Local small scale operations may be just as effective as industrial scale projects. Establishing an
 efficient industry in NZ will allow us to promote and encourage other first and third world countries. We have clear international
 obligations in this regard.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes

 This is a difficult decision because it may be necessary to act sooner, but we cannot risk delay and should strive to reach the target
 as early as possible regardless. Global warming must be kept below 2 degrees.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 They should form part of our overall fiscal imperitives. They are more important than any of the other targets the Reserve

 Bank/Treasury may have.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Notes
 This is too difficult for me sorry. It really does depend on what will most effectively get us to goal zero as soon as possible.
Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

As above.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Broadly, but there must be priority given to scientific knowledge over short o9r medium term economic co9ncerns. The biggest
economic concern we have is climat change.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

Essential that we have transparency, focus and avoid ignorance of the goals.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Science. Science. Science. Work with all scientific disciplines including the social sciences, but vested self-interested groups cannot
be allowed undue influence. Data, statistics, facts, reason and logic must prevail here.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
And it must be an august body with genuine Mana and influence. It's recommendations should not be ignored.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes
Mana and control please, Provided the commission has the right science dominated composition.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Broadly, yes, but Science first please.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes
Change is here, now.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Please can we have the best cross-party consensus here but please can we be guided by science and objectivity and not by self
interest or short term economic concerns. We are all going to have to change. We are all going to have to make some sacrifices and

suffer some short term losses perhaps. if we are smart, swift and innovative we can actually profit substantially, both in terms of a
healthy safe future and a booming carbon negative economy. Yes, carbon negative. We can help ourselves and others here and we

must try.
