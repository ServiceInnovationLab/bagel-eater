Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
The science behind this is politically motivated and the models are being constantly revised and changed as they fail to accurately

predict the changes we are seeing in the climate. We need to understand the effect of Space Weather and the effect of the sun
being at a solar minimum on the planet. The weather is changing on every planet in our solar system not just Earth. This is easily

verifiable and noted by NASA and other space agencies around the world. So are we sure that it is the CO2 causing the climate to
change? Greenhouse effect is definitely real but is it really as bad as we are being made to believe? People don't want to accept that

in order to get research grants you have to not go too far outside established theory. Who decides who gets the research grants?
Just like Doctors promoted smoking or the Catholic Church refused to accept a heliocentric model scientists can and do get it wrong

sometimes at a grand scale. When we look at the biggest polluters in the world they are not those being most targeted by climate
change law. This is because they are so called 'developing nations' such as China and India.Now USA totally withdrew from the Paris
Accords. Although they have made commitments and are making some token gestures they continue to pollute on a scale that

dwarfs NZ. Even if we were to purposefully pollute and emit carbon as much as we could we couldn't ever hope to match even a tiny
portion of what they output. Right now our economy isn't doing well. 15% GST on basic food items, increasing fuel tax, ignoring our

natural gas reserves and other natural resources, and other taxes are making NZ an unproductive nation where people cannot/don't
want to open businesses. Poor people are hurting and even living in cars. Having to beg the government for assistance as there

aren't enough jobs for them to get a decent wage. We are not in any way big enough to be considered part of this problem where it is
worth hurting our economy. We are not a rich nation. We are far poorer than other nations which are considered developing and falling
further behind. We need to make sure our economy is strong otherwise our emissions certainly will drop if we enter into a Venezuela

type situation. For example if something like Mad Cow Disease broke out here think of what a position we would be in. This is not the
only scenario we should be considering. An Earthquake in Auckland which damaged the harbor bridge is another example of

something that would cripple us economically. We absolutely must put our economy first before we start to consider global
commitments and virtue signaling. There's no point in being the #1 in reduced carbon emissions on the hollowed out shell of a

nation.
