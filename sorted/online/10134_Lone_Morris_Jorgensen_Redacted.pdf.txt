Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Lone, Lone Morris Jorgensen








Reference no: 10134

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 It is important to have a set target within a reasonable timeframe. This target should be within THIS generation as leaving it beyond
 that puts it into the 'whenever' basket and no workable decisions will be made until it becomes an emergency.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases
 Notes

 At this point we need to work with what is important and what is possible. Otherwise it moves to the 'too hard basket'



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 Can we really trust international carbon units????



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 The reason should be very compelling if it is to be extended. Revising it downwards is acceptable at any time.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Unless we have a budget we cannot know how we are doing.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes
 The budget should be changed ONLY if there are compelling reasons for doing so. 'Compelling' does not just mean economic

 impacts.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
Only downwards!




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Notes
I am not yet committed on this




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes

If there is no requirements the task will only be postponed



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The Government should first and foremost consider impacts on the environmnet. That also means that when economic
considerations are asked to be made that these economic considerations include the economic cost imposed on the environment

i.e. at the moment there is no cost allocated to the environment for the 'services' the environment carries out for us.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

It is important to have a watchdog to monitor progress (or otherwise). The commission will presumably not be sidetracked by multiple
other demands made on it. Thus decisions on ETS should ONLY pertain to the environment NOT to economic groups within NZ




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
The Commission should not have the final decision making power. That is too easily hi-jacked.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
I am not committed on this issue yeat




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

This must be a 'yes' as we know the climate change is happening now so advice also need to be given about how to adapt to it.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

I am still thinking about this - this is an issue that will clarify further as we progress.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

The more we know the better our decision making will be
