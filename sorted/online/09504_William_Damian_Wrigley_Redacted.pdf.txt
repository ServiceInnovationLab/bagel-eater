Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

William Damian Wrigley, William Damian Wrigley








Reference no: 9504

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes
 Provided that the Commission is open to any future changes to scientific knowledge.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Carbon Dioxide - Reducing net carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2050
 Notes
 The target must exclude enteric methane and other agricultural emissions as much as possible- in years to come food production will

 become a priority.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes
 Benefits from plantation forestry, as opposed to regenerating natural forest, are dubious. Purchase of international credits will buy NZ

 more time in which to make appropriate decisions.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 We live in interesting times. Anything is possible- war, plague and other upheavals. NZ's contribution to global emission is so small (
 0.17%) as to be insignificant. It would be foolish to commit NZ to a target that was either unachievable or damaging out of proportion
 to the benefits accruing.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 No
 Notes




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes

 . All NZ law is subject to the whims of Parliament, which is in turn answerable to the electorate, at intervals of not more than three
 years. To presume that the present electorate or parliament is more knowledgeable or superior to those that come later is extreme
 arrogance.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
All NZ law is subject to the whims of Parliament, which is in turn answerable to the electorate, at intervals of not more than three

years. To presume that the present electorate or parliament is more knowledgeable or superior to those that come later is extreme
arrogance.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
No

Notes



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The government may set the plans, but it will be over to the private sector to implement them, and absorb or pass on associated
costs. High compliance costs may threaten the survival of some business sectors. It will need to be a function of government to
assess the value of various sectors to NZ, and apply emissions credits accordingly. Transport and agriculture, for example, could be

awarded a higher priority than tourism.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
The Commission should have no role at all other than advisory- all decisions should be the prerogative of the government of the day.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes
At least two of the proposed commissioners should have demonstrable practical experience in land management.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

If the Zero Carbon Bill becomes law it will seek to chart NZ's course from its present level of carbon emissions to those considered
desirable and achievable by 2050. The circumstances that will prevail in 2050 are unknowable. It will be the function of interim

governments to continue to monitor the desirability and achievability of the 2050 target, NZ's progress towards achieving it ( or its
revised iteration), and its effects on NZ's citizens.
