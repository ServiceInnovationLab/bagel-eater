Suzanne Torkington









Reference no: 10062

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 We have only one chance to get this right, allowing alterations will give those with the greatest power a chance to advance greedy

 causes at a negative cost to the rest of humanity



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

At all times Iwi must be involved with any consultation process. Industries that benefit financially from the use of environmentally
damaging products should not be given any power to override any decisions




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes
The proposed expertise must include any new credible information/research/discoveries that may arise.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes

Notes
It is essential that all organisations and businesses within New Zealand share information regarding climate change risks in their

production methods, ingredients/materials, especially raw products and particularly on disposal methods. e.g. should the packaging
they use be environmentally damaging to dispose of.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

New Zealand needs to put climate change at the top of it's priorities. It is the most important issue because it effects not just the
future our this wonderful country, but the survival of humanity and the animal kingdom. Humanity made the decision to be the

caretakers of this planet, we now must take that responsibility seriously and ensure we do our best to repair the damage our greed
and laziness has created. Our children and their children must have a future worth looking forward to, as should all living species on

this planet. New Zealand once lead in such matters, it is time for use to regain the position as an ethical nation.
