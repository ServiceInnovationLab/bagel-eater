Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Patrick Morgan






Reference no: 9172


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes

 I strongly support the immediate creation of a Zero Carbon Act, with a net zero target by 2040. This is line with scientific consensus
 to reduce the chance of exceeding a 1.5 degree temperature rise. I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse

 gases to net zero by 2040. I support taking a science-based approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as
 possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Notes
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2040 as above



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 This target should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using international carbon credits.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 On the basis of current science the target date should be 2040 to maximise the chance of avoiding dangerous climate change.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes

 Yes, the target may need to change as the science develops.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Yes, the target may need to change as the science develops.



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes

We urgently need to decarbonise our economy to meet targets. For example, set carbon budgets for transport, agriculture and
energy production.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
We urgently need to decarbonise our economy to meet targets. For example, set carbon budgets for transport, agriculture and

energy production.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes
We are already experiencing the impacts of 1ËšC of global warming. We have seen marine heatwaves, causing our hottest summer

ever this year, along with more flooding events and cyclones hitting many parts of NZ. Until now, the Government has relied on
regional councils to come up with their own planning for this, but many of them are calling for national guidance. We need

Government guidance in this area, and a national plan.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

The Government must prepare a National Climate Risk Assessment.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

I regard this as the Govt's top priority.
