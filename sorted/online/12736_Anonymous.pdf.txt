Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 12736

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 Methane is the most emitted greenhouse gas in New Zealand so including it has the most opportunity for improvement. Also
 because it stays in the atmosphere for a shorter time, reducing it will have benefits almost immediately. Net Zero emissions is the
 most ambitious option. We need to be ambitious and raise the standard for other countries. Net Zero emissions by 2050 will benefit

 us the most and increase our opportunity for mitigation and adaptation.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Notes
 I support both of these options as long as the the overseas carbon units are legitimate.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 Its important that the zero carbon bill is strong and legally binding for whoever is in government.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 No, the government can change too often for it to be worth it. The emissions budget is too important for parliament to fight over

 every three years. This is a long term target for all parties to work together on.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
 To meet emissions targets, policy must change.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

The considerations are important. There should be more though because climate change is a very broad issue. I would like the
climate change commission to find out the most effective ways to reduce emissions, the changes that will cut the most emissions

quickly. For example, dairy farming. Reducing dairy farms will have much greater impacts than reducing beef farms because dairy cows
need more nutrients.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Its very important to work with social scientists. As well as policy change we need behaviour change. Essentially we need to change

our behaviour to mitigate climate change and meet emissions budgets. Social scientists know how to change peoples behaviour
effectively.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Add in a behaviour scientist because we need to change our behaviour in order to reduce emissions.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

We need a mix of adaptation and mitigation and often they go hand in hand. Changing our economy from animal farming to forestry is
mitigation because it reduces emissions and adaptation because it will be easier under future conditions.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

We need more! We must phase out animal agriculture and change our economy to adapt to climate change and be more sustainable.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Animal agriculture is the main driver of climate change. Please dont let our culture stop us from acting on it.
