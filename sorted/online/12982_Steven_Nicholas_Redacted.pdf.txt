Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
We need to have robust science around the role of our pastoral based industry as they have ability to build carbon into the soils and

compared to systems that rely on constant cropping of land which can deplete soil carbon. Take care not to lock targets and taxes
into legislation into effect without the ability to allow for changes in science and inovative initiatives.
