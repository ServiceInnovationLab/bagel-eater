Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Nick Kirkman








Reference no: 11957

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 I don't think 2050 is ambitious enough.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 We shouldn't be arguing about how to cheat on this. Just get it done. We can't have Cows and Dairy if the environment is totally
 destroyed anyway.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 We also need massive dedicated carbon sequestration technology to be developed, e.g. massive scale chalk mining sequestration

 and dedicated renewable power stations focussed just on powering sequestration tasks.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 The current climate models a) assume massive human sequestration efforts, none of which remotely exist yet, and b) prevaricate
 about secondary and other tipping point effects (such as permafrost methane release). These will happen, they are happening

 already and we need to be much more aggressive about dealing with these. 2030 would be a far better date.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes

 We will need to revise this downwards, not upwards.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
e.g. when the ice sheets collapse ahead of expectations. Gonna happen.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
The current IPCC models assume massive human intervention in sequestration. This is not even close to happening yet, but most

people are utterly ignorant of this. A 2050 target is nothing like aggressive enough.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

It needs actual teeth.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Seriously? We're not the USA. We need the best brains and talent with the most experience for these roles.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

We're going to need to adapt. Transport and infrastructure need hardening for 100yr events to become annual. We need to be able
to take them in our stride. Housing needs upgrading, seawalls need building, etc. etc.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
