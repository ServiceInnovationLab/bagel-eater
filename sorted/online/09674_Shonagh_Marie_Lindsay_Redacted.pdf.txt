Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
1. Climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing people in poverty here and in developing countries. We can’t ignore the

impact climate change is having on our neighbours in the Pacific and across the developing world. 2. Climate Change is a global
problem – it cannot be tackled by countries in isolation. New Zealand must demonstrate global leadership and match its bold

domestic emissions reduction agenda: by having an equally ambitious climate change strategy abroad. 3. Access to climate finance
is a matter of climate justice – those who have contributed least to the causes of climate change are typically the most vulnerable to

its impacts and have the least resources to respond. 4. We must take responsibility for our global emissions and the climate impacts
that we have contributed to. It’s very important that all New Zealanders have their say on how we make the shift to a zero carbon

future here in New Zealand but we must also help the world’s most vulnerable communities across the Pacific adjust to the impacts
on climate change. 5. We must ensure that the Zero Carbon Bill is transparent. This means the bill must include a requirement to
produce annual reports about New Zealand’s international climate change contributions in order to ensure that the Pacific countries

get the support they need and can plan to adapt to their changing environment. 6.Transparency in the Bill will promote public
engagement and political accountability. New Zealanders will be able to understand the international contributions we are making and

as a nation, we will be able to stand tall that we are supporting our Pacific neighbours adapt to their climate change reality. 7. It is time
for New Zealand to lead again. We have a history of global leadership: we were the first country to give women the vote and the first

to become nuclear free. It is time to take another giant step towards climate justice globally. 8. New Zealand has demonstrated global
leadership with our commitment to stopping oil and gas exploration – now let us continue that moral leadership and include
transparency in what and how we support climate change efforts abroad. 9. Demand that the Zero Carbon Bill supports the most

vulnerable people in the Pacific! .
