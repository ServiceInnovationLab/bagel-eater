Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Eileen Wright, Member of Green Party, Greenpeace and Forest and Bird (Eileen Hilda Wright)






Reference no: 1898


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 The Climate Commission as an Independent Watchdog would publish progress reports on target emissions and highlight any
 problems that arise, so that government is in a position to make the necessary adjustments to reach the stipulated net zero
 emissions target.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 Net zero emissions are a global responsibility, a target we must all aim for, using some emission reductions from overseas is
 hypocritical.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 The Climate Commission should be well placed to keep successive governments on track to meet the target of net zero emissions

 by 2050.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Definitely, this Act needs to be a serious proposition not something a change of government could destabilise at their whim or the

 whim of polluting industries.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No
 Notes
Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
These emission budgets should set out the pathway to zero emissions over each of the three 5 year timeframes.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
We need to bring on board our talented innovators to create emission free industries to replace industries that are emission loaded

and so create new jobs. We need to bring on board environmentalists to explore how best to interact with our land, iwi and hapu. This
is the only way we will meet targets of zero net emissions



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
In order to ensure the Climate Commissioners are the best people to advise and monitor progress towards the Zero Emissions Act ,I

would suggest we select equal numbers of female and male Climate Experts of different political persuasions, so that they can
concentrate on the job in hand with no outside interests clouding their judgment.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Notes
I would like the NZ ETS to be abolished.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
The Zero Carbon Act must cover how New Zealand will adapt to the impacts of climate change. This requires a National Adaptation
Plan which gives a clear direction to local government on how all sectors, iwi and hapu included, can coordinate their response to the

impacts of climate change.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
I do hope for the sake of my small grandchildren that we will come together as a country to recognise the need to work as a team to

reduce our carbon footprints. Let us be an inspiration to our international ,global neighbours.
