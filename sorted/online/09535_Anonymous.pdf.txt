 future governments decide that it is not their priority

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
Work on educating the public (Particularly the youth as they are the ones that are going to be dealing with these issues in 2050), and

help them find alternatives and cut back on their emissions (set goals)

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
I believe that education is key!! A lot of people know about climate change in the abstract, but they don't understand or know the

implications of it/how it affects us and our world. The government needs to make a more concious effort in educating everyone in
New Zealand, so that EVERYONE is equipped to make at least small changes- you can't change your behaviour if you don't know why

or how
