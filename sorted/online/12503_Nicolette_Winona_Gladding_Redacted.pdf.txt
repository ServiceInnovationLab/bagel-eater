Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Nicolette Winona Gladding








Reference no: 12503

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 However, I believe the target should be set for 2040



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2040



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Notes
 The target should be able to be revised only if the government decides it must reach the net zero target sooner to meet international
 agreements. The target should not under any circumstances extend beyond 2050.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes
 Any changes must improve outcomes by reducing emissions




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 But only if it wishes to make modifications that will allow NZ to meet its target more quickly.



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

I don't agree entirely. I believe that effects on the natural environment including ecosystems must also be a factor. Also, the extent to
which decisions will adversely impact pollution or emissions globally. We should not be able to export our emissions.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

Of course there must be a clear plan to achieve budgets/targets and it should be assessed by an independent panel of experts to
ensure the plan can achieve set targets/budgets



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
We will not meet targets if government selectively listens to business lobbies and government entities focussed on economic

growth. Net zero targets must take precedence over short-term economic growth. Therefore Government should hear from local
authorities, Greenpeace, Forest and Bird, scientists and the wider community to ensure we are on track to achieve targets. Also, I
believe that effects on the natural environment including ecosystems must also be considered. These considerations should be

global so that when considering HOW to reach targets the Commission must consider the environmental costs (if any) of meeting
targets including, for example, pollution generated by the production of solar panels. We should also consider and be responsible our

consumption of imported goods that are arriving from developed countries that have not set targets. We don't want to be in the
position of essentially exporting our emissions. Options assessments should consider these factors



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
It should also advise on options (incl costs and benefits) on HOW to achieve targets/budgets. This should include advice on our

impact on global emissions based on our consumption of imports. We should not be relying on other governments in terms of how
our imports impact global emissions. The Commission should be able to advise government on this matter (essentially trade matters)



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

With government having to clearly explain deviations from that advice



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No
Notes

I'd also like to see Ecologists, experts in international/global climate policy, International law and someone who can advise on trade
issues.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes

I think legislation around adapting to climate change should be incorporated into the RMA and the local Government Acts (alongside
a boost in funding). This Bill should focus on reducing our impact ON climate change not the effects OF climate change.
