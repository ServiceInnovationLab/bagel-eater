Notes
As a Kiwi selling NZ Food and Beverage products in China for the last 20+yrs I can attest to the incredible market value our
Clean/Green image provides. Unfortunately with the last Government's lack of concern for this, our Pure NZ brand is now totally on

the rocks as well expressed by the UK Guardians article "Dirty Little Paradise" As an economy with over 70% of our GDP relate on
agribusiness, economics and the environment are allies in building our international reputation/"Point of Difference" and

subsequently a prosperous nation. Due to our size, location and economic base we have a unique opportunity to take the lead on
the world stage as the cleanest economy in the world, without that what do we really have to offer the world of any real economic

value? English schools? Bungy jumping??!! Our moment is here. Lets show resolve and courage to meet the greatest challenge of a
generation.
