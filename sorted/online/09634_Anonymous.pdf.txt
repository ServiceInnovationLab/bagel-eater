Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 9634

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes
 Animal agriculture needs to pay for it's cost on the environment; Milk and meat prices will rise, encouraging people to eat plant based

 diets that are healthier for themselves and for the environment. Win win.



 Clause
 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

 Notes
 NZ has a very meat-headed and dairy heavy culture. Start promoting the benefits of plant-based diets now, to ease pain and

 resistance when meat+dairy prices rise, and to help farmers prepare to transition from livestock to crops. Waste management,
 particularly food waste and composting are areas we can make large savings primarily through education (and city council
 composting facilities). Education at these scales takes time; maybe even a generation. Start now. Include it in primary school

 curriculums & advice.
