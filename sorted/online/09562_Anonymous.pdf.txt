Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill












Reference no: 9562


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 Setting the target in legislation would provide simplicity and certainty.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 I am opposed to setting only a carbon dioxide target, as this ignores a big part of the problem. Agriculture's role in New Zealand's
 emissions needs to be addressed. While stabilising short-lived gases could be a workable compromise, I prefer the more ambitious

 target of zero net emissions across all greenhouse gases. This would encourage a transformation of New Zealand's economy, and
 show leadership on the world stage.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 I am opposed to any form of international carbon units unless it can be proven that the units are being bought from a country whose
 net emissions are well below zero. It is preferable for us to show leadership in transitioning to a truly carbon neutral economy.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 This would unnecessarily complicate the legislation, would normalise the idea of revising the targets, and might still fail to account for

 the future circumstances New Zealand will contend with. If any future situation genuinely makes the 2050 target completely
 untenable, or completely unnecessary, then it is likely that the government of the day would have sufficient mandate to make

 changes to the legislation.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 I'm concerned that future emissions budgets would be revised due to slower-than-planned progress in reducing emissions. This
 can't be normalised. However, it would be nice to think that budgets could be revised due to faster-than-expected progress, or
 disruptive technologies.
Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

It is better to not create the perception that emissions budgets can be revised. In truly exceptional circumstances, the government of
the day could choose to amend the legislation as a very last resort.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

New Zealand's economy and diet are highly dependent on meat and dairy. The Government needs to consider how business
innovation and consumer cultural change can be encouraged, to help transition the economy to more sustainable diets (eg plant-

based or synthetic). If we can reduce New Zealand's dependency on the meat and dairy industries then we can reduce our
vulnerability to the economic shocks that would be caused by global diet changes. It is better for us to be leaders (driving the
development of sustainable food industries) than for us to compete with overseas innovators while clinging to our current model of

production. This is a big, long-term issue that needs to be addressed in a considered, iterative way, bringing people, farmers, and
businesses with us and not leaving anyone behind.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
I support the option "Advisory, with mechanisms built in to hold Government to account"




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Any data feeding into a national climate change risk assessment should be collected according to prescribed standards. There is a
risk that different organisations will interpret such standards differently, reducing the comparability, accessibility, and ease of

integration of the data. Any such data should be in a standard, machine-readable format (eg collected via APIs), and if possible be
well-integrated with the rest of the environmental and government data ecosystems.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
The discussion document focuses quite heavily on the effect of the proposed emissions targets on GDP. It should be recognised

that GDP is only one very selective measure. Slower GDP growth isn't inherently a bad thing (in fact, it can be a good thing if it means
reducing the economy's burden on Earth's finite resources while maintaining an acceptable level of equality and wellbeing for all

people). It would be good to focus on the effect of emissions targets on a basket of measures summarising the wellbeing of people
and the environment, and not only economic growth.
