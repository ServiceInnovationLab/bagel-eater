SPEND THE MONEY NOW. Stop virtue signalling and actually take a stand - sure it might be a mild hit to our economy for a short time,

but we won't have a goddamn economy if we don't take a stand against climate change.

YES! The bill will be useless otherwise....



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Just do it. JUST DO IT. honestly...... The environment should come first - the economy can come LAST as far as I am concerned.

Yes

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

spend less on stopping it.
