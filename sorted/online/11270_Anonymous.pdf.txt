Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
The local Public Transport systems of New Zealand need to be revised & improved to help meet Zero Carbon targets. Local public

transport should be free or at least more of an economically attractive option than driving a car. Currently, from personal experience,
this is generally not the case. Strong consideration of economic subsidies to the general public within the areas of Renewable Energy
(Solar, wind) and Electric Transport (Bicycles and cars) should be made to promote growth in this area, while relieving and ultimately

eliminating dependency on fossil fuels. Accounting for 49% of the nation's greenhouse emissions, agricultural practices and
Resource Management legislation in New Zealand need to be reviewed and emissions heavily reduced.
