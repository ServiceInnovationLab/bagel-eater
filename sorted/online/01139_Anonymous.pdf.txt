Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill







Reference no: 1139

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 I would only support changes to a more ambitious goal



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes
 I would only support changes for more ambitious goals, not reductions



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No
 Notes




 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Yes and these plans need to be informed by SMART objectives, indicators, and a transparent monitoring strategy. There needs to be

 transparency also on the achievement (or not) of the targets and the further actions taken.
Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
There needs to be focus on (1) the biggest emissions source, the animal agriculture, and (2) the transport system, where NZ has a

very large potential for improvement (reducing dependency to car, serving not only environmental objectives but also health,
inclusion, equality and participation in the local economy)




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

The Commission's recommendations should be key elements of decision. If the Government were not to follow them, a strong case
should be required.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
There needs to be a strong competence in *change* management, especially transitioning out of animal agriculture and car-
dependent transport system. Transitioning *out of* but also with a clear vision of "towards what". "Engineering/infrastructure" is very

vague; I think that there needs to be competences in the transport system (beyond infrastructure) and in water and energy
engineering and conservation.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes

Every aspect of the forward planning needs to take into account the climate change, probably beginning with the Zero Carbon Bill.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

I can't find these functions in the document



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
Notes

Reporting should be independent



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
The document is overly focused on the economy. I find it very inappropriate, given that it is question here of (1) our survival as a

species, (2) our moral obligations towards the living beings and our future generations and (3) the development of New Zealand as a
nation and society. Vision needs to lead, not the economy. The economy needs to transition in a way that supports the vision. In the
opportunities, a few key elements are missing: (1) modal shift in transport: reduced overall costs (infrastructure, environment, health,

participation in the local economy, people's well-being) (2) Increased accessibility an participation, through a less car-dominated
system. The current situation makes it difficult for whole demographics to participate in the economy, education, or other
opportunities (see work of Karen Witten et al, on transport-related severance in NZ). Philipp McCann had made a clear case for more

accessible and better functioning cities - I had put some key points and links here: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/case-cities-new-
zealands-economy-tamara-bozovic/ (3) better water quality, through decreased dairy and animal farming (I do hope that the biggest

generator of pollution will be tackled and that animal-oriented agriculture will transition to plant-based sustainable farming, for
environmental but also moral and ethical reasons). This will have positive outcomes on health but also tourism, matching the "100%
pure" label In terms of solutions, the EVs should not be presented as one for cleaner air, given their high emissions of thin particles

(https://www.thenewamerican.com/tech/item/23226-study-electric-vehicles-pollute-more-than-gas-powered-cars ). They are also
hardly an environmentally-friendly solution at all, given the needs for non renewable materials, roads, further contribution to urban

sprawl and continued need of roads & road renewals. The end of oil will mean the end of asphalt too, but also the need for more
resource-efficient transport solutions. Finally, while I am thankful for the opportunity to contribute (noting I am not a New Zealander
but do consider myself as a contributor to this society), I regret the level of language of this document and the formulation of the

questions, making them not necessarily accessible to all.
