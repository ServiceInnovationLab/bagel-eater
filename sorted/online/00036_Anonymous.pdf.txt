Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill






Reference no: 36

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 The Climate Change Commission can decide if it sees fit to increase the target - ie. be carbon negative by X% by 2050, or achieve
 carbon 0 before 2050.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 Disingenious question. What are you really asking here? Agriculture and its emmisions should not be given a free pass. Agriculture is

 our biggest emmitter and if we include them it forces us to find solutions. Pressure and stress are big motivators in getting the job
 done.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 This works best for brand NZ - clean green etc. If we can't do it with a population of only 4 million in a developed economy then either
 no one can or we are incompetent. We need to set an example, be innovative, find solutions that can be exported.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 Unless its to accelerate the process. We need to shoot for the stars and worst case we reach the moon.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes

 If the case that this 3rd budget is to be watered down, there should be rigorous checks and measures.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Exceptional circumstances need to be clearly defined. A local natural disaster eg Christchurch earthquake should not be considered
 an exceptional circumstance. Perhaps we can put local exemptions in place in such a scenario but keep national targets unchanged.

 Also a global / national economic crash should not be an exeptional circumstance. (They're not really exceptional as they seem to
occur every 10 years or so anyway and we are due for one soon it seems) In other words we should not allow the disfunction of our

economic system to dictate our emmision reduction targets. GDP, unemployment, inflation etc are not accurate measures of
economic and social health. We should not prioritise these false measures over life itself.




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
The government should be required to respond to recommendations from the CCCommisison within 1 to 3 months not 3 to 6.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

Timeframe should be defined.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

UNEP - auditor or advisor.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Consider legislation that could trigger the Commision to take over decision making if the government fails to meet its targets, fails to
set carbon budgets appropriately, fails to keep NZ's obligations under the ratified Paris Accord. Or a system where the Commission

can 'fine / sue' the government (or the even better the ruling party/ies) and monies used for appropriate carbon e reduction activities.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Prioritise society over the economy pls



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes
Biggest adaptation needed is to foster and allow the building of a parallel economy that mitigates as much as possible the potential

for total collapse and chaos. Decentralised renewable energy grids. Business shifting to a social enterprise model (as opposed to
private, shareholder) to keep things going - supply chains etc. Ensure food stability and security - localised vertical farms for eg.

Community resilience and self-sufficiency. Decentralisation. Crypto. 4 day then 3 day work week to save resources. So much to do....



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
