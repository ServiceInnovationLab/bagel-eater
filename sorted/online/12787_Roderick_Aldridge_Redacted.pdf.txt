Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Roderick Aldridge, Roderick Francis David Aldridge










Reference no: 12787


Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 The government should start by embedding some fundamental principles which should be followed setting up and operating the Act.
 These should include Fairness and equity - a just transition for all people and sectors of society Comprehensiveness - it should apply
 to all people, groups and activities in the system Sustainable - the effect should be to provide desirable and stable future for our

 grandchildren. Honor the Tiriti o Waitangi by working in partnership with Maori to include tikanga Māori and Māori worldviews. The
 government should set the target in legislation now. It should try to build an all-party consensus if possible to give more long-term

 certainty. It should also seek input from experts particularly the Climate Change commission.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 The government should prioritise the targets according to the period and time of their effect. GHGs emitted early in the period will
 use up more of the permissible capacity available before 2050 requiring drastic cuts to later emissions.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 This should include other carbon sinks such as developing or restoring wetlands or any other way of reducing net GHG emissions.
 Experience shows that NZ has no control over the integrity or actual effectiveness of foreign or even internationally acredited

 schemes..



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No

 Notes
 Only in exceptionable circumstances such as a major natural disaster or game-changing new evidence backed by solid scientific
 research.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 This is necessary to provide as much certainty certainty as possible



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes
Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Only in exceptionable circumstances such as a major natural disaster or game-changing new evidence backed by solid scientific
research.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
I generally agree with the proposed list of considerations to take into account when setting emission budgets.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

It is no use having a target without any plan to achieve it as happened previously. Emissions continued to increase despite the target.
The government should have a reasonable time to develop a plan - say 6 months . Definitely not more than 8 months.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The most important issues are Comprehensiveness. fairness and equity, sustainability and honoring the Tiriti o Waitangi (as

mentioned in Qestion 1) Consultation as widely as possible with priority given to the Climate Change Commission and those with
relevant scientific knowlege and community links.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Monitoring the progress towards achieving climate change goals and advising Government are to fuctions for an expert body. Policy
decisions are for governments (politicians). The Commissions would have a conflict of interest with their role of monitor.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
Th Commission making decisions would have a conflict of interest with their role of monitor.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
I generally agree with the list. I would like to see expertise in sustainability and wise use of resources. Also the effect on general

wellbeing.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
The Commission needs to understand and advise what can be adapted to. what needs to be adapted to, and the limits of adaptation.
Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

I generally agree with the proposed functions.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

The government needs the most comprehensive information it can get.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
To be really effective you need to take a holistic systems approach. There needs to be more emphasis on eliminating greenhouse

gas generation at source everywhere in the system. Nearly everything that is produced causes GHG generation in its production
There need to be the right incentives reduce net GHG emissions everywhere in the system, for producers goods and services more

efficiently with fewer GHG emissions.. Then there is the exponential growth in production, much of it producing ephemeral goods
which are used briefly and then thrown away, depleting resources and generating waste, including GHGs and toxins. Universal
product stewardship and a price on all net GHG emissions – at a price equal to the damage they cause is the only way to really deal

with climate change. If they cannot afford the price, then the should change their production so that they can. Otherwise the goods
should not be produced. Of course this would cause massive disruption if it was introduced immediately, so it would need to be

phased in. This brings me to the third point. Change is urgent because more than half the GHG emissions emitted before global
temperature rises above 2ºC have already been emitted, and emissions are still increasing for the reasons above. All emissions now

use up what is available before 2050, requiring more extreme and disruption if we are to meet the target and prevent unacceptable
temperature rise and potentially a positive feedback loop with irreversible effects. The Government needs to work with everybody
both here and worldwide to achieve the fundamental changes needed. The climate Change Bill begins to address the problem, but

more comprehensive action is needed if we are to meet the taget and avoid catastrophic change.
