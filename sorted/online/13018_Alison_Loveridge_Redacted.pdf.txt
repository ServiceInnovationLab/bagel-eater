Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Alison Loveridge








Reference no: 13018

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 It is important to have a strong goal. Urgent action is required.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 Stabilizing short lived gases is achievable - new technology may make it possible to go beyond this to net zero short lived emissions
 in the future but that is not certain at present. Agriculture has not had strong goals set for change and while making progress it is

 better to have a trong message for change now, than a weaker one that creates less momentum for change. It is important to
 maintain its role as an employer and contributor to the NZ economy as a whole and support for the goals must be prioritised.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes

 The firewall concept whereby meets its goals for domestic reductions of emissions but may also contribute globally is well thought
 through for a small country dependent on international relationships



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 If zero net emissions could be achieved earlier than anticipated this should be strongly supported. Tragets should not be delayed
 beyond 2050.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 It is important to have clear steps for each year with the aim of measured achievement for the short term (5 year) plans. But long term
 goals must also be planned for - so that subsequent governments have a clear tack to follow and the plans are not subject to political

 expediency and erratic changes by new governments



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 15 years is actually a very short period in terms of the extent of change required. If new technology or other favourable circumstances
 allowed the goals to be achieved early the subsequent plan (4th) could include further reductions
Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

As above, the shorter the time frame the less likely lower emissions than planned for can be achieved. The closer the time more
important strong targets are to mobilise resources for change



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
The social aspects are crucial and far more needs to be considered than fuel poverty. The social presumably includes cultural change
and the understanding that information and technology etc are intimately connected with people's understanding of what is

important in life, how life should be lived, and how everybody can come to see themselves as having an important contribution to
change and see it as creating opportunities rather than to be resisted.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes

If the plan is not available early, and it will presumably include consultation and publicity will create widespread discussion in the lead
up, momentum will be lost. Delay encourages people to hope that new technology developed overseas will save us making hard

decisions. It is quite possible that overseas solutions will not work in New Zealand and the slippage in time hoping for such solutions
will make change much harder and more expensive when it comes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Climate change will be experienced locally and local government is crucial in all plans and needs to be adequately resourced. Social

service providers will be very important in terms of understanding the flow on impacts of plans and budgets to ensure that groups
with few resources already are not further excluded by change. Local consultation and including ordinary people is also important.

The Christchurch City Council's "Share an Idea" shows what can be achieved if people get excited about the possibility of being
listened to and could help work through details of impacts.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

These are important functions. It will also be necessary for the advice and reporting to be available and able to be acted on by all
sections of society, not just central/regional/local government. Attention to process and progress will be required across all sections

to ensure government action doesn't lag.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

Exact levels of available units, their costs and administration needs to be supported across all political parties and thoroughly debated
to prevent the sort of political action of the past where new governments have removed the effectiveness of plans. However giving

Commision legal powers to enforce their plans is too authoritarian



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes
Needs more emphasis on social science expertise to assist conversion of knowledge into action and identify vulnerable groups within

society and their needs. Communication and "community engagement' sounds top down and so not able to engage in the ways
required



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

it should be wholistic in approach. Adaptation will be unavoidable and planning needs to start early



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
Sharing information and acting jointly will be essential to making the degree of change required in a short time frame. new
technologies are improving our ability to share data all the time and discussion on privacy, safety of data from cyber crime etc is under

way.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Urgency should not lead to overlooking social justice issues
