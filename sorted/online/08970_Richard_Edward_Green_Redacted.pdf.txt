Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Richard Edward Green






Reference no: 8970


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes
 Layman - not qualified to answer this




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 New forest planting only a stopgap measure - every tree planted will one day burn/rot as timber and return its carbon to the
 atmosphere. Also, forest land will be needed for settlement as climate change refugees start arriving. Solar energy MUST be fully

 exploited. (see Stonefields development in Auckland - 8000 roofs and ZERO solar panels, neither hot water nor photoelectric. This is
 madness. Make solar compulsory on all new dwellings and subsidise retrofitting. Include farming in emission reduction calculations
 and incentivise diversification away from livestock.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Who knows what technology the future will bring???



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes



 Clause

 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
 Notes
 Transport and heating (electricity generation via solar), de-escalating livestock farming in favour of horticulture and organics.
Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
But it should also have a strong focus on mitigation, given that the seas will rise regardless.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

Stupid question. Of course it should. No brainer



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Notes

What layman can answer this?



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Provisions need to be set in stone against the risk of any future National/Act government coming to power.
