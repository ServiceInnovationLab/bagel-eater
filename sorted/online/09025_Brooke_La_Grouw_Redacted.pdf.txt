Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Brooke (Brooke La Grouw)




Reference no: 9025

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 None. The government should not be considering carbon as an emission or greenhouse gas. CO2 is essential for plant life. I breath
 out CO2. Volcanos breath out CO2. Natural burning forrests give off CO2. CO2 is NOT bad, its good.. Wake up!




 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 No target.. Leave CO2 alone!



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Notes
 No target.. Leave CO2 alone!



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Notes
 No target.. Leave CO2 alone!



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 There should be no budget or government spending to control a natural emission relating to CO2.. Other gasses proven to be
 harmfull should be considered only with proof... proof! and not by some C+ scientist paid for by the government!



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes
 No government control should be used to control CO2.




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Notes
 No emissions budget should be given to government for control of CO2.



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes

 No government or commission should be setting budgets to control how an essential gas like CO2 should be controlled.. We need
 this gas to support plant growth. There is also no scientific correlation between climate change and CO2 levels.. The climate has

 been changing from the beginning of time. Adapt! not control!



 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Notes

 No. I dont want government controlling climate in any way during any time frame.
Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
None. Let nature and climate change be.. Climate change will only get worse if government intervenes, like everything else

government intervenes in..



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

We don't need a climate change commission. Let the climate change as it will, and adapt to the change as it happens.. Controlling
CO2 will not have any reducing effect on climate change.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Notes
None.. there should be no ETS. The ETS is a scam!




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
There is no logic in wasting money on experts with an imaginary agenda to controlling CO2 emmissions.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Notes

The zero carbon emmission concept is a fake science to begin with. Carbon dioxide is essential for our climate. Humans will adapt to
real climate change regardless and don't need government to lead us down a path that destroys our economy and our climate..




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Notes
What a load of crap! Climate change is NOT locked in from historic emmissions.. Climate change is natural and will happen if we are

here or not.. Government will destroy us with it's bullcrap science long before the climate will have any serious effect on our humanity.
Adapting to our environment is normal, and we certainly don't need government to do this on our behalf. Government hinders

humanities positive flow forward, it does not help it..



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Notes

No. For god sake no! Let the climate alone. You have no clue how it works!



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
Climate change is a natural ongoing event, and is not caused by carbon. The government can help by staying out of something it

knows nothing about. Why on earth would government want to minimize production of one of the most essential compounds like
CO2. This is what supports plant growth and our existence, and the main reason we are thriving on this planet..
