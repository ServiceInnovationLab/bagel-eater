Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

     Richard Arlidge









Reference no: 12126

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes
 There has to be leadership from Central Government otherwise it is the tyranny of leaderlessness



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 Dare to struggle dare to win - Don't fool yourselves half measures might make it a little bit better. Be honest - Be the LEADERS




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes

 When assessing net carbon balance remember the West Coast of the South Island is the only area/province in NZ with a net positive
 carbon footprint. The forests here swallow up the CO2 generated in the polluting cities and farms of the rest of NZ.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Once the melt rate of the glaciers and ice sheets accelerates (sea level rise will not be linear) then more action may be required.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes
 Emmisions budgets will have to be increased in time. Start hard and go for it now.




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
You need to take into account the fact the West Coast is the great NZ carbon sink. The forested lands of the many National Parks and

stewardship lands are constantly regenerating. Gorse soon turns into bush (30 years) on the West Coast but not in Nelson or
Canterbury because the lower rainfall means the gorse mulch stops young plants growing. The higher rainfall on the West Coast

breaks this mulch down and the gorse becomes a nursery crop. These forests are the carbon sequesters. Set up a provincial ETS so
that the polluting provinces pay rates to the West Coast.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

Will the NZ ETS be a political football or will it have BALLS?



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
But not all academics. Get a few lay people from the provinces - you will surprised at their world view. .




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
We need a big plan NOW.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

Who is going to pay for retreat and relocation?



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes

Notes
The rate of change will not be linear so you need to be adaptive.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Sea level rise is having an impact on the roading infrastructure on the West Coast of the South Island. How much has the Government
budgeted for throwing large rocks at the ocean in the next 10, 20 and 30 year periods. Sea level rise will not be linear! Start quarrying
today.
