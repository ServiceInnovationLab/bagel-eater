Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Anna Dobson








Reference no: 583

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes
 Legalise industrial hemp to sequester carbon and for soil remediation, medical cannabis and alternative materials manufacturing. Also

 enact laws to phase out animal farming of all sorts and enable subsidisation of plant based diets for humans and animals. This will
 achieve net zero emissions. Lets be clear on who the actual perpetrators of carbon emissions are: Farming.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 Legalise industrial hemp to sequester carbon and for soil remediation, medical cannabis and alternative materials manufacturing. Also

 enact laws to phase out animal farming of all sorts and enable subsidisation of plant based diets for humans and animals. This will
 achieve net zero emissions. Lets be clear on who the actual perpetrators of carbon emissions are: Farming.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes
 Coordinate local net zero emissions strategies with international net zero emission agreements, to increase the environmental

 benefit and effect.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 The 2050 target should only be revised to achieve net zero emissions locally if the current strategies in place to reduce carbon
 emissions are insufficient as regards time frame or capacity. I think NZ could achieve net zero emissions by 2035 and we should try

 with stricter strategies and more forceful and defined conditions.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Yes. Having a defined timeframe enables real time and frequent checking of efficacy of the strategy against the goal in order to
 determine if more action is required to achieve the goal within the timeframe, or sooner than the specified time frame. A timeframe

 enables fine focus on the effectiveness of the strategies outlined to achieve the goal, and allows time to introduce further strategies
 to increase the success of the goal .



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes
Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Only if the goal of achieving net zero emissions, is achieved within a shorter timeframe than 2050.




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes. Timeframes will hold governments accountable ideally.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
A national climate change risk assessment Climate change exacerbates existing risks and creates new risks. Many councils and

communities are already dealing with some of these. At the moment, our actions to adapt are ad hoc and we cannot measure our
effectiveness. To address this, we propose introducing a compulsory national climate change risk assessment that is updated

regularly. The Climate Change Adaptation Technical Working Group has recommended that this type of assessment is a priority. If we
can get a better understanding of which areas and communities are the most exposed and vulnerable to risks, we can ensure we are
taking the most effective actions to address these. Our first step is determining what the risks are for people, infrastructure, the

natural environment and the economy. This information needs to be accessible and standardised to help decision-makers, including
iwi and hapū, communities, transport and infrastructure sectors, private sector firms, and central and local government. A risk

assessment would need to align with and inform other risk work by the Government. It could provide valuable information to the
National Security System and the Ministry for Civil Defence and Emergency Management and other interested agencies. The

proposed national climate change risk assessment would: • identify risks to New Zealand that arise from, or are worsened by climate
change • provide the necessary evidence to improve how we communicate current and future risks and opportunities • provide a

foundation for investment and decision-making, and guide future work • inform development of a national adaptation plan • inform
planning and actions to minimise the cost of future climate-related disaster response and recovery • contribute to an approach
across all sectors to help stimulate action in a systematic way • provide accessible and standardised information for decision-making.

Placing this requirement in primary legislation means future risk assessments continue to take a broad view across the economy and
society and there will be continuity over time, creating a more stable policy environment. A national climate change risk assessment

would be publicly available, updated at five-yearly intervals and the Climate Change Commission would hold responsibility for this.
While the Commission is being set up, central government could initiate the first risk assessment, with future assessments falling

under the responsibility of the Climate Change Commission. Future assessments could include information obtained from the
adaptation reporting power, if developed (see below). All of that above I am in agreement with. Also I am in agreement with all of
this:What expertise could the Climate Change Commission have? We seek your views on the range of expertise that the

commissioners could have. The UK Committee consists of a chair plus five to eight committee members and an adaptation sub-
committee with five members. The members have a high level of standing in society and are sector experts rather than

representatives of particular stakeholder groups. We consider our Commission should have similar credibility and the following
essential expertise: • climate change policy (including emissions trading) • resource economics and impacts (including social

impacts, labour markets and distribution) • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests • climate and
environmental science including mātauranga Māori • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning, insurance and

local government • risk management • engineering and/or infrastructure • community engagement and communications. Desirable,
but non-essential, expertise could include: • business competitiveness • knowledge of the public and private innovation and
technology development system. Including the expertise needed in the Commission in the Zero Carbon Bill aligns with the UK

approach and the recommendation of our Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment. This is who I think could be consulted:
People involved in Industrial Hemp - hemp to sequester carbon, and Vegan food producers growing plants for meat/dairy/wholefood

and processed food types. Vegans growing plants for industrial level manufacturing should be subsidised and supported in the ways
that meat farmers have been for years. Meat and dairy farming need to be phased out of existence as they are the primary

contributors to carbon emissions. Plant production for carbon sequestering and human and animal food production needs to be
prioritised, legally and financially endorsed in preference to animal meat and dairy production to fully achieve net zero emissions.
anything less and you are merely pandering to the financial and conflicting interests of the Meat and Dairy Lobbies.
Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes. I would like for the Climate Change Commission to have the strongest level of influence on New Zealand governance and
legislation. I would like to vote for Decision making powers in this regard.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes
same answer as above.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Also include those manufacturers and industries with known net zero emission histories ie Vegan plant based food manufacturing,
Horticulture ie Hemp Industry, Organic Horticulture. Exclude all animal exploitation based industries such as meat and dairy farming

from being a stakeholder. Meat and Dairy farming are the culprits of continuing carbon emissions. Continuing to include the
perspectives of the Meat and Dairy industry and their interests which conflict with reducing carbon emissions would be an ignorant

decision to make.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Again: The strategy of banning Meat and Dairy industries within New Zealand is the most New Zealand can do to achieve net zero
emissions by 2050 alongside endorsing and enabling Vegan food production and Industrial hemp/horticulture/native forest tree

creation to sequester carbon. These contributions to the strategy are essential.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Ban Meat and Dairy Farming in New Zealand as their continued industry presence will compromise and sabotage the goal of net zero
emissions. Subsidise financially and legally endorse and support Vegan plant based food production businesses for human and

animal food, create a greater list of plant species enabled to sequester carbon such as Industrial Hemp, Manuka, Horticulture, NZ
Native forests in a polyculture not a monoculture.
