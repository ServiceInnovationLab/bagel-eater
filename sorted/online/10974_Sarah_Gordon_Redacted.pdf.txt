Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Sarah Gordon






Reference no: 10974


Submitter Type:     Business / Industry

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later

 Notes
 Zero Carbon Bill is a bit of a misnomer if you are also looking at reducing methane and other shorter living gases. I don't think the
 destinction is understood by the wider public. It would be better to take the time to engage qualified people onto the Climate Change

 Commission whou are experts in their field and let them advise the government/cabinet who may have a different agenda depending
 on their own personal drivers



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived

 gases
 Notes

 Currently there is not a viable commercial affordable option for farmers to attain this goal while still being able to maintain a profitable
 business. I recently attended a workshop and while the science was explained well there were still no practical options for farmers to
 use although some of these are being explored by scientists currently



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes

 It is important to invest in infrastructure that will stop effluent being poured into the sea every time there is a weather event. I have
 been told that Rotorua District Council discharge effluent into the forestry which seems a pretty archaic way of handling sewerage.
 There needs to be conformity across district council along such lines as effluent treatment and disposal. It is not only businesses and

 farming that contribute but also councils who are charged with maintaining standards. To me this seems pretty hypocritical.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 It makes sense to allow change when presented with new information not just to lock onto a solution and follow it regardless of
 whether circumstances change



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes
 It is important that there is the opportunity to revise our options as more scientific information comes to hand, eg if it is going to

 bankrupt the country to achieve the last little bit you would question the wisdom of doing this.
Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
as above, the safeguard being that it is under exceptional circumstances - this would need to be clarified as to what this constitutes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

It is important to break the goal down into manageable chunks with definite time frames



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The provision of sound, accurate tools to measure emissions - at the moment it seems as though tools that weren't designed for the
job are being shoe horned to fit eg Overseer, which for years people have been qualifiying using it by saying " this tool wasn't really

designed for this but it is all we have" Surely after all this time something fit for purpose could have been developed



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes
need an independant commission outside of politics to maintain a consistent approach not one governed by who happens to be in

power at any one time



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
As long as there is a balance i.e. not weighting towards any of those listed attributes in particular - if there is a bias it should be

towards peope with technical knowledge and also as long as the best people are picked not the people that will give the current
government the answers they want to hear.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
It is important that a realistic and balanced view is taken over this bill, not singling out of one industry as a scapegoat. It is also

important that people have a reallsitic view of the science behind the bill and that the Carbon credit side of things is well understood
and possibly needs a second tier where for instance if you have areas of planting on farms that you may not get a monetary value of
carbon credits but it should offset your emissions to a measurable degree as this will encourage planting of waterways, gullys, etc

that might not fit into the current criteria as far as size and species but surely has a value to carbon monoxide sequestration.
