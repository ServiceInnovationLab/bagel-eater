its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause

Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
We feel carbon trading is a financial scam and does nothing to reduce emissions as it enables emitters to continue asper usual, Air

NZ's fly all you like but buy a tree to feel good about it is a good example.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Seen in a motor museum in Switzerland in a climate change exhibit, They will not be doing anything about tourism, in particular air

transport as this is their main income earner. Perhaps NZ needs to be aware of what is happening in other countries, particularly in
relation to their main income earners and agriculture. We need to remember no other country is including agriculture and if NZ cuts

it's agricultural production this will be taken up by countries with far greater emissions than ours. Let us remember WE are world
leaders already.
