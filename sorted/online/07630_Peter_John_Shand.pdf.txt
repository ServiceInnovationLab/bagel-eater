Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Peter John Shand









Reference no: 7630

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes
 Start as we intend to continue, do the hard yards first.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 Weight for weight, methane has 105x the warming impact of CO2 during the 20 years after its release, so It would be a massive

 backward step not to address it ASAP.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 Although planting trees is essential, it should not be seen as a 'lucky save'. In assessing the impacts of greenhouse gases, we need
 to avoid 'compartmentalisation', separating the carbon budget into different areas, which has the effect of making, say, the forestry

 and farming sectors look less-polluting than they actually are. For example, in the case of forestry, the CO2 cost of using chainsaws
 and diesel-powered machines, as well as logging trucks - and in farming, milk tankers and Fonterra's use of coal to power its plants -
 should be set against those product supply chains, instead of being divvied out separately as Transport and Industry. On the second

 point, we should get our own house in order rather than relying on overseas organisations to be doing what we should be doing.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 But the focus must always be on: what sort of planet are we leaving our children.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
Yes

Notes
Yes, but again the focus should be on medium- to long-term goals rather than short-term ones governed by say election cycles or

feathering nests now rather than later.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

1. Stick and carrot: Tax the polluters and use that money to support low-carbon initiatives (eg, tax internal combustion motors and
their hydrocarbon fuels then subsidise electric cars and the charging network). 2. Identify low-hanging fruit (gain public support and

move quickly): So the average Kiwi expends about 17 tonnes of CO2 a year (2012 figures) but really can't do much about the (roughly
50%) agriculture emissions. What they can do is a) use an electric vehicle (a saving of at least 5T CO2 per family when 'embedded'

emissions are taken into account) and b) adopt a vegan diet (saving 1.8T CO2/year). Straight away, a several-tonne saving, if people
can be encouraged to take up these options (via the aforementioned stick-and-carrot method). 3. Join the dots: Avoid the
'compartmentalisation' of carbon budgets (mentioned in response to Question 3), enabling high-polluting sectors such as dairying to

externalise some of their costs. Detailed research is required to ascertain the true carbon, or GG, cost of products, including
'embedded' or externatised costs, and industry must be required to be upfront about these costs (for instance, the oil industry has

not released the embedded pipeline-to-petrol-pump costs (drilling, pipling, shipping, trucking, refining etc) for well over a decade. 4.
Don't let farming, or any polluters, off the hook. It's an extraordinarily tough call to make, but necessary. Food production (and its

manufacturing and transport) is simply the biggest threat to climate. Agriculture needs to be turned to the diet we need to adopt -
vegan. This would not only hugely reduce our greenhouse gases, it would lead to more trees being planted. To this end, the Govt
needs to urgently come up with a map that identifies the best soil types, weather etc to grow various crops. Then it needs a 'stick

and carrot' approach to transform pastural farmland into horticulture. The positive here is that this land will eventually produce roughly
10x more food, employ many more workers and reinvigorate rural towns. 5. Improve infrastructure: Continue to upgrade public

transport; electrify rail, buses and ferries (while taxing air travel); design and build electric ships for our primary exports; continue to
develop cycleways and walkways ......




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

Only committed action within the next two decades will save humans from extinction.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

I agree the commission needs to be advised by such experts but they will have narrow fields of interest. While requiring a deep
understanding of climate change and related issues, the actual commissioners will need to have a big-picture, broad-brush
approach, and have the ability to convey that succinctly and clearly to the Govt and public at large. I suggest budding commissioners

are asked a list of 5 questions: 1. Do you think humans will survive climate change unless we immediately start taking robust
measures to alleviate it? (A 'no' would be a massive fail.) 2. Are you concerned about what sort of planet we might leave to our

children, grandchildren and future generations? 3. What actions have you personally taken to mitigate your impact on climate
change? 4. Do you have a vision for what broader actions could be taken? If so, what? 5. Do you have a good grasp of the science

behind climate change, as well as aspects of human psychology and construct that make our response to it so far so
underwhelming?
Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
A no-brainer really. We already know the climate has warmed sufficiently for the sea level to rise 5 metres (although we don't know

exactly when but we need to look beyond those dodgy end-of-the-century estimates). It is beyond stupid to allow new infrastructure
and development in low-lying areas, for example, unless certain precautions are taken (such as making houses transportable).



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Humans have had a very narrow window to do something about climate change. Perhaps 50 years, of which 30 have already passed -
and we have literally lost considerable ground already. For the sake of future generations to enjoy this beautiful planet, DON'T MESS IT

UP.
