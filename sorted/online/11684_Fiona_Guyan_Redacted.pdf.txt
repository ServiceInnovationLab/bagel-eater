Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Fiona Guyan, Fiona Ross Guyan








Reference no: 11684

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 This should only be changed in line with new international agreements backed up by scientific bodies (IPCC), or to speed up the
 target.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 It is urgent that emissions reduce particularly quickly in the first phase of emission reduction, not later.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 We are learning more all the time about causes & effects of climate change,. We don't know how effective the safeguards will be.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 As in Q1, only if targets are strengthened or backed by IPCC.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 5 years should be the maximum.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes
 But only if the Commission is in full agreement, & scientific research can improve target time.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
 Notes
 We are already in exceptional circumstances.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes, on the 'how to' achieve targets. Not on the targets themselves, or the budgets for them.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
3 months max.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
These plans need specified implementation: responsibilities, timelines, accountabilities, consequences. They need teeth. No person

or body responsible should be above liability.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Our recent history shows us that advice to government on the environment, even when sanctioned by government,(eg., from the
Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment), can be ignored. The Commission needs to be appropriated sufficient resources to
be independent, & guaranteed access to MfE resources. The Bill needs to specify this.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes
The wording could be changed to "NZ ETS or alternative methods." The reliance on the market using ETS is too much in doubt. It has

not worked in other sectors, eg., housing. Carbon budgets, or introducing carbon taxes, could be alternatives.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

But also, in international climate change, bio security, bio diversity, health, and social science.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes
Much more direction & compulsory implementation is required. Recent events have shown that many people need a catastrophe on

their doorsteps, to realize the extent of change in the natural world. In our own area, I work as a landscape gardener, and am getting
numerous calls from residents in an area that was inundated in the storms earlier this year. The developer of this subdivision back in

the 1970's was refused consent the first two times he tried, but on his third try the council ignored their own predictions of future
trouble. Now the insurance companies are very busy there. (Thus escalating insurance costs to us all..)



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

But the suggested tools 'A national climate Change Risk Assessment, 'the National adaption plan', & the 'National adaption reporting
power' are positive examples of clarifying & strengthening the parameters.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
Optimally this would be brought under the responsibility of the Commission itself, rather than another body.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

This Bill is the most important piece of legislation this year. It needs to be future government-proof. Thankyou for setting this Bill in
motion!
