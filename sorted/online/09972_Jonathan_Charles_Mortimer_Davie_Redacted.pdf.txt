Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Jonathan Davie, 1958 (Jonathan Charles Mortimer Davie)










Reference no: 9972


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Carbon Dioxide - Reducing net carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2050
 Notes

 Methane should be treated exactly the same as CO2, a flow gas. There is a huge difference between greenhouse gasses coming
 from a new source ie fossil fuels and those coming from biological process which naturally cycle, this needs to be acknowledged.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes
 There must be flexibility incorporated so that changes in understanding can be included.




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
 Notes
 I would like to see flexibility as a priority, for example if science changes it need to be able to be quickly incorporated, too often laws

 that seemed good become distortionary in an unexpected way



 Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
There should be agricultural scientists included. If the government believes agriculture produces 49% of greenhouse gasses there
must be liaison with the scientists.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
Separate it out otherwise it will become unwieldy



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No
Notes

Set it up separately, not under a law



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
No
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
My main submission is about the contradiction in recognising CO2 as a flow gas (being incorporated by plants then respired by
animals), and the lack of recognition that methane which while a different cycle is effectively the same idea. If carbon dioxide is zero

then methane is 25 times zero, that is the maths of it.
