Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Cornelia Nell Harrison





Reference no: 12037

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 WHY NOT set a target now? Not setting it infers indifference, lack of commitment and most importantly, lack of understanding of the

 real effect that emissions have on our changing climate.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 As it is scientifically proven that all greenhouse gases have a negative impact on the environment then we must aim for net zero
 emissions across ALL greenhouse gases. Fear of the changes we have to make in order to live in an emissions free world should not
 be greater than our fear of the changes we have to make in a world impacted by the effect of these emissions ie it will be far harder to

 live with the environmental and health changes that result from climate change caused by all greenhouse emissions than it will be to
 go through the process of positive change.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Notes
 The only reason to change would be to bring the target date forward.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes
 It should only be able to be changed to allow for a more ambitious target to be reached.




 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Notes
 Only if it is all based on science, not interpretation and/or opinion.



 Clause

 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
Of course. Setting time frames are needed whenever a target is set. These plans must be made available to the general public, and

should be required within a short timeframe following the Emissions Budgets being set (under 12 months)



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Health and social equity ie the significant potential benefits of combined action for health, equity and wellness. Government must
take under consideration the Treaty of Waitangi in it's planning. And also thought must be given to any and all sustainable economic

opportunities



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
It is essential to also include health and wellness expertise.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes, in so far as the Zero Carbon Bill is in itself a process to adapting to climate change.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
There needs to be transparency to ensure accountability and enable constructive co-operation between organisations
