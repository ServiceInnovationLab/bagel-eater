Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill








Reference no: 8277


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 Every bit helps to keep the temperatures from raising further and faster. Methane may be 'short-lived' but is an accelerant so please

 focus on getting all warming gases down as soon as. All industries including primary industries must be part of the solution



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Notes
 I do not favour ETS - prefer a carbon tax



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 'Yes' is ticked for pragmatic reasons only. Would be ideal if constraints can be set out to ensure that flexibility does not lead to the
 release of more warming gases than planned for 'economic' reasons. In other words best to ensure target can only be revised to

 accelerate the decrease in warming gases



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
 its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
Yes

Notes
This seems the best option for a democracy. However, the recommendations of other advisory bodies are easily ignored by

governments. Need to explore legislative measures to ensure that the government of the day is held accountable. The ballot box is
simply not suitable in this situation. Need other measures in addition to this. Monitoring is useful but not sufficient to keep a

government focused on the task especially with so many lobby groups wanting their interests to be excluded from measures
requiring the reduction of warming gases.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Notes
I don't favour ETS approach



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
It would be good to have a polymath (or two) or integrators to overcome the 'silos' effect. Would like to see an ethicist on board too.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause
