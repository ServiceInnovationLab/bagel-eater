Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Maureen St.Clair Dunn






Reference no: 9471


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later

 Notes
 It is prudent to set a target to reduce emissions. However Humans will never stop the climate changing. So the priority must be to
 adapt, shift and manage the changes already taking place and into the future.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases
 Notes

 As outlined above; no use making targets we can't meet!



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 No

 Notes
 Five years is such a short time. Surely more could be achieved and money spent more wisely in a 10 year period? Once again -
 threshold targets are going to be hard to attain.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Difficult to answer these questions as unable to access the pages referred to in "Our Climate Your Say" :(
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Need to work with farmers, industry, forestry, market gardeners, food producers, transport (public and more affordable electric

vehicles), medical profession and emergency services.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Hopefully there will be regular communication between the CCC and government at all stages.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
Otherwise what is the point? The two are inextricably linked!




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Would like to know more on these functions.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
Notes

Definitely needs to be a broad spectrum of society, community, experts, land, sea and river occupations.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
Focus should be on reducing emissions from petrol-driven vehicles, use of chemical sprays, plastics, manufactured perfumes,

cleaning products, fleecy materials etc. etc. And ALL important; planning for the changes in climate already here and into the near
future; floods, sea inundation, storms with the resultant damage to structures, power supplies, drinking water and possible injuries

and or deaths. Emergency services; police, fire and ambulance should be part of the overall picture. NB/ Found the 'Our Climate Your
Say; website but could not find the relevant pages referred to in the questions :O(
