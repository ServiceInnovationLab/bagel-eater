Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 10767

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 I favour setting the 2050 goal now for the purposes of accountability. The goal may force the governments hands on necessary
 action where it may not have but for the goal.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 Per the Ministry for the Environment, agriculture GHG emissions make up 49.2% of our total, and carbon is not the main issue there.

 Any targets that exclude the main GHG emissions from agriculture would be avoiding a significant part of the issue as unfortunately
 industry that has prominent release of short-lived gases are common in New Zealand. For any legislation to be effective, it needs to

 cover all of the issue green house gases.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 By restricting it to domestic emissions reductions, we can ensure that New Zealand is actually making a difference on the world
 scale.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 It would be bold to assume that we can predict all of the challenges that New Zealand will face with climate change, and the potential
 for revision if necessary is important. However the accountability referred to in question one is also important. I still fall on the side of

 being strict, however a means or revision in exceptional circumstances would be useful. This should only be used with thorough
 consideration from the climate commission to prevent parties that may be less willing to do what is necessary for the environment

 from abusing it. Should circumstances worsen however and action be necessary in a shorter time frame, this revision method should
 not be a means for stopping New Zealand from adjusting to more ambitious targets.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 Like question four, only if completely necessary or if targets need to become more ambitious.
Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

See question 6.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Yes, specifically in terms of accountability. Should political parties change, this will become of upmost importance.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes, this will be important should NZ's efforts not be enough on a global scale. This should be informed by the climate commission,
given the expertise outlined.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
