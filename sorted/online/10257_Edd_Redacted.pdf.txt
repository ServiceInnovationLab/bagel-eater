Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Edd




Reference no: 10257

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 Net zero emissions isn't good enough. We need to emit LESS greenhouse gasses than we are now, not the same amount.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes
 See #1.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 You never know...




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 Any term with National in it could undo everything.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Only if they actually are exceptional. Like a cloud floats down to the ground and contains traces of coal deficiency and a swarm of
 honeybees spells out the letters "we actually need more greenhouse effect, thx." Don't let anybody weasel their way into pretending

 a non-exceptional circumstance is exceptional.



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes
 It's hard to agree when I can only find and read the summary, but it sounds alright.
Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
As quickly as possible, please.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
We're already putting out too much emission. We need to consider going net -50% or more for a while.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
They should know what they're doing.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Notes

Oh god...



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

I read the summary. It *sounds* good, but logic tells me the writing style is too unclear and indirect. Around the politics bush, so to
speak.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes

Notes
It would be incredibly interesting.




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Don't screw this up. We're counting on you.
