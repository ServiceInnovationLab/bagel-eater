 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes
Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Address those GHG sources which are easiest (economcally and technologically) to address in the short term first, such as
conversion of coal fired boilers at schools, universities and hospitals eg. by replacing coal with electricity or biofuel (eg woodchip) for

milk powder production. The Government could fast track this process by providing grants and low-interest loans to institutions to
encourage more rapid conversion away from coal.

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
1. The Government of NZ and MfE should be applauded for at last taking some concrete steps to ensure urgent and significant

action is taken to address the most serious environmental issue that humanity has ever faced. 2. Clearly, it makes sense to focus
resources initially on where we can have the greatest immediate impact (ie targeting the low-hanging fruit first), in this context
phasing out the use of institutional coal boilers, such as the one we use here are Lincoln University which uses approx. 2000 tons of

coal a year, would be good place to start. Grants or interest free loans (perhaps over a 10 or 20 year period) would be one way in
which the Government could facilitate a rapid transition. 3. The future of the Aluminium Smelter at Bluff should be reviewed - while an

important local employer it uses 15% of NZ electricity which could be better used for powering electric vehicles and electric boilers as
we transition away from fossil fuels. 4. Adaption to climate change needs to consider the global impacts of climate change especially

regarding the creation of "climate change refugees" and the impact of climate change on the global economy. This will require more
resilience to be build into a national "coping strategy" and plans to steadily increase our annual refugee quota.
