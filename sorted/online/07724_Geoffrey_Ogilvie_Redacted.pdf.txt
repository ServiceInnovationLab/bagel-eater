Reference no: 7724

Submitter Type:

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes
 Probably too late (2050). Loss of habitat and Greenhouse emissions particularly Methane from Melting permafrosts and polar ice caps

 has already past several tipping points and created many feedback loops that will see neat term 6th Mass Extinction (Anthropocene).



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 International Carbon Units is a stupid idea and should be avoided at all costs




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes
 Review will only be needed to reduce target dats. This however is putting the cart before the horse.



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No
 Notes

 Too little. Too late. Better the Government concentrate on the security of borders when the 6th Mass Extinction process begins
 within the next few years (Not decades).
Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
Too late but do it anyway.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Every carbon, methane and other greenhouse gas producer needs to stop increasing emmissions yesterday.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
No. Its too late for advice. We (Informed persons) know that we have passed Climate change tipping points and have set in motion

feedback loops that will take more than 140 years to remove.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes

Scrap the ETS as a bad idea and a stupid concept from the start.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

No. PM and Cabinet must act now to set up public planetary hospice processes to help the NZ public cope with the coming near
term 6th Mass Extinction. The planet is in Planetary hospice NOW.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

All sectors of the NZ socio-Economic paradigm need to be made aware of the near term 6th Mass Extinction on this planet. That
includes, Government (All departments), Business (All), Public Organisations and the population at large.
