Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill











Reference no: 2080

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes

 We should have acted on climate change 30 years ago, any further delays are simply adding to the cost!



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 We are only now experiencing the change caused by emissions from 30 and 40 years ago, we have to reduce emissions at all costs!



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 We should not buy into carbon units.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 We should be able to act sooner if practicalities dictate.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes
 Successive governments cannot be allowed to derail the process to reduce emissions



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 We have to allow for exceptional circumstances
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

We have to understand that a short term economic impact is to be expected in return for a long term gain. The more we delay, the
greater the overall cost will be.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Looking at all possibilities to reduce emissions including potentially changing our primary industries in order to meet those budgets.

The need to reduce animal agriculture is clear and by increasing our horticultural products we will be offsetting our other emissions.
We also need to stop investing in fossil fuels and stop all permits for further ff exploration. We already cannot afford to burn what is

here now, we must stop squandering more money in the wrong places!



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
Adaptation is vital, as this will be the hardest bit!




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes
It must be fully independent without successive governments being able to change the goal posts. It must be decided on scientific

basis only.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Do not allow those whose business is creating climate change to complain about the loss of their profits as a result of actions to
combat climate change. That is a dying economy and we cannot allow it to continue to have it's say.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

Vital.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
We need to have joined up thinking in our plans to manage climate change. It needs to be global action too. NZ could lead the way,

we could have a purely organic horticultural economy and be the food basket for Asia as well as our local economy. We could go
100% renewable power etc




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
Again if we do not, we will miss some vital information. Ministers must be told the truth, we need to know the reality of our situation,

not be lulled into comforting lies.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
NZ could be a world leader in adapting to climate change. We could be implementing solar panels on all public buildings, reducing our

power need nationwide, we could be investing in public transport in our cities, making cars an unaffordable luxury. We could improve
working conditions so those who could work from home, do so, reducing the need for a daily commute. The greening of public

buildings and open spaces would mitigate our pollution, the improvement in our recycling would reduce our need for new raw
materials. We need to become more self-sufficient, Community gardens a must-have, fruit trees grown in public spaces,
encouragement of vegetable gardens for all who want to grow their own.
