Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Jennifer Dymock








Reference no: 2540

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 This proposed Bill presupposes that there is climate change that significantly impacts on New Zealand environmentally and socially

 and which necessitates mitigation responses. This has yet to be proven scientifically



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 No Zero Emissions targets are necessary as significant impacts of climate change yet to be determined scientifically.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Notes
 There should be no targets as emissions are not yet scientifically assessed. Premature adherence to targets will negatively impact on

 New Zealand productivity and standard of living. No replacement "green" technologies are available or research into zero carbon
 alternatives planned.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Notes
 I oppose the Bill. However the scientific method allows for challenges to hypotheses. Cannot prove an hypothesis, in this case, that

 significant climate change is occurring, but evidence that disproves the hypothesis is considered and the hypothesis is then rejected
 or modified. Scientific endeavour always allows for challenges, flexibility and modification of hypotheses in the face of evidence



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes
 There should be no Zero Carbon Bill and no emission budgets set



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Notes
 Reject the Bill as insufficient scientific evidence is available



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes

 Reject the Bill



 Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Notes
Scrap emissions budgets




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Consider all scientific evidence NOT just that which conforms to pre-existing viewpoints




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
Scrap the Climate Commision




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes
Scrap the Climate Change Commission and the Emisions Trading Scheme




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Notes
The Commissioners have be selected to agree with political sentiment (not analyse scientific data)




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Notes
The zero Carbon Bill, in its very nature, is attempting to mitigate (not adapt to) climate change which has been occurring since the

earth was formed. Living beings on this earth have been subject to climate change for billions of years. Climate change is the norm.
The zero carbon Bill should thus be scrapped.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
Any change in future land use, production should be undertaken under guidelines which mitigate pollution including human and
animal waste, toxic waste (chemicals, plastics). Carbon dioxide and methane are not pollutants. They are part of the carbon cycle =

they are vital for life and cycle ie. are in balance.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
No
Notes

More bureaucracy and waste of tax payers money



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
As entomologist working independently in the Far North of New Zealand I have been monitoring insects in the warmest part of New

Zealand since 1999. Insects are regulated by temperature so are ideal indicators of climate change. I can report that since its arrival
in 1999 the Tropical grass webworm, Herpetogramma licasisalis, has not spread further south of Kaitaia, despite its food source

kikuyu grass extending throughout Northland as far south as coastal Horowhenua. As its name suggests this is a tropical insect
which is at the limit of its distribution in New Zealand north of Kaitaia. In 20 years climate has not warmed sufficiently for this insect to

extend its range (Dymock et al. 2009. Proceedings of the New Zealand Grasslands Association 71: 25-30). I am currently working on
distribution changes of a range of key insect indicators of climate change.
