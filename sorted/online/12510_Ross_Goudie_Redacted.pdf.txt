 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases
 Notes

 OPTION 2 in the light of the following information I support a 2050 target which is ambitious, clear, and science-based. which allows
 for the practicalities of New Zealand’s emissions, particularly from agriculture. It is important to take a science-based approach to

 ensure our emission reduction efforts are as impactful as possible. This means adopting a “two basket” appproach, which
 recognises the difference between long-lived greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide) and short-lived
 greenhouse gases (such as methane). Applying a two baskets approach to achieve a net zero 2050 all gases target would mean: ●

 Combining long-lived gas reductions with permanent carbon sinks (e.g. through permanent forestry and carbon sequestration in soil)
 to achieve negative long-lived emissions by 2050; and ● Reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. ● Commitment to
 reducing short-lived gases like CH4 to lower levels This would balance out to net zero across all gases, but in the most impactful way

 possible. Short-lived gases do not need to be reduced to net zero to stop temperature rise. They only need to be stabilised. New
 Zealand should aim for a sustainable level of short-lived emissions which fits with the Paris Agreement goals to keep global warming

 well below 2C, striving to 1.5C. Long-lived emissions, however, contribute to global warming until they are reduced all the way to zero.
 Because these gases exist in the atmosphere for millennia, finding ways to absorb more of these gases from the atmosphere than
 the amount we are emitting (known as “negative” emissions) is the most ambitious and impactful contribution New Zealand could

 make to counteract global warming. Accordingly, the Zero Carbon Act should prioritise reducing long-lived emissions to net zero, and
 then to negative emissions, by 2050 or sooner. The second option provides a fair contribution from agriculture over its whole profile,
 within the context of a bipartisan political framework. The principal emphasis must be on emissions reduction across the economy,

 avoiding over dependence on forests, which have limited capacity in the long term. In summary: ● I supports the most ambitious,
 clearest, science-based target enabling effective consideration of the difference between gas properties. ● We need to reduce all

 greenhouse gases, including methane. ● Applying two baskets thinking to our 2050 target, the most ambitious and impactful
 approach would be to achieve negative long-lived gas emissions, while reducing short-lived gas emissions to sustainable levels.
 Getting to this point would mean that New Zealand is contributing to global cooling. ● Set the framework for a constructive political

 debate within a bipartisan framework. Note: a two baskets approach means taking a scientific approach to different gases. It does not
 mean treating the agricultural sector differently from other sectors. Nitrous oxide, which is primarily emitted through agricultural

 practices, is a long-lived greenhouse gas. It absolutely must be reduced to net zero. The science is clear that methane emissions
 must also be reduced. However, it is simply not necessary to reduce methane to net zero to stop global warming.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 as long as forests get the current global price.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
Position

Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
Notes



Clause

7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

I generally agrees with the proposed list of considerations to take into account when setting emission budgets: ● scientific
knowledge about climate change ● technology relevant to climate change ● economic circumstances and, in particular, the likely
impact of the decision on the economy and the competitiveness of particular sectors of the economy ● fiscal circumstances and, in

particular, the likely impact of the decision on taxation, public spending and public borrowing ● social circumstances and, in
particular, the likely impact of the decision on fuel poverty ● energy policy and, in particular, the likely impact of the decision on

energy supplies and the carbon and energy intensity of the economy ● the government’s obligations under the Treaty of Waitangi ●
the three government objectives for climate change policy: sustainable economy, global and local leadership and creating a just and

inclusive society



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Engage with community groups to understand and enhance community capabilities in responding to climate Change



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
I generally agrees with the proposed list of expertise which should be collectively held by the Climate Commission: ● climate change

policy (including emissions trading) ● resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour markets and distribution) ●
te Tiriti o Waitangi, ● climate and environmental science ● experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning, insurance

and local government ● risk management ● engineering and/or infrastructure ● community engagement, communication and
action. Desirable, but non-essential, expertise could include: ● business competitiveness ● knowledge of the public and private
innovation and technology development system.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
I support the government being required to prepare a national climate risk assessment, and a national policy plan to address these

risks. A monitoring and reporting framework is also important. We need to think carefully about how local councils should be involved
in these processes.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
