Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

?, .. (Dean Foster)








Reference no: 11618

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 No target needed



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes
 No target needed , more research is needed before penalising innocent New Zealanders with more tax




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 No targets more research needed



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Notes
 Don't have a bill don't penalise us



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 Don't do it




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes

 it is best not to pass any such bills requiring and restricting the government, people need to eat and live first and foremost and
 banning using coal or oil when the research is not sound enough while families die of starvation or the cold or lack of work isn't good
 enough . If bills are signed into law then the ability to change them is important.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Please dont blow our taxes on paying overseas organisations re carbon credits , it is better not to sign into law any such bills but if we
 do the ability to change them is important



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
No
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
Those advocating for climate change action need to present their case and that's it .




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes
The C.C.C. can give a report that's it




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes
They can give a report only




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

Of course expertise is needed but it is all relevant and non biased opinions are needed



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Notes
Science now shows there is no way life on earth happened by chance ! From cosmic radiation to molecular biology Prof John C

Lennox shows clearly ( in his book "God's Undertaker: Has Science Buried God?")that now through science God must exist.Josh Mc
Dowellshows clearly in his nearly 1000 page "Evidence that Demands a Verdict " that Jesus claims to such diety have more evidence
than not.Jesus accurately predicted the Roman destruction of Jerusalem and also predicted the world will die echoing the prophet

Isaiah's prediction that the world will wear out like a garment. A recent article in the N.Z Herald showed that scientist/s believe man's
contribution to the global warming is only about .3% !!!! The causative agent ( according to the article )being the natural degradation

of the oceans' vegetation. Another N.Z Herald article showed the global warming calculations are clearly reliant on various computer
models showing some of the data or perhaps much or most of it is conjecture!Clearly trying to save a planet that science and

evidence shows can't be saved by spending a fortune and punishing taxpayers along the way is not wise.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

I am unlikely to agree with them sorry haven't read them.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes
Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
I certainly would like to see us look after our planet and save it if possible but paying $1.5 billion or so to overseas Emissions Trading

Organisations when computer models and scientists disagree on things making the whole thing unwise to penalise taxpayers.Of
course cutting down on pollution and producing more renewable energy sources and cleaner energy sources I think is great

.Painting fossil fuels ( and farting animals)as a huge bad proponent is not really a good idea.Putting C.O absorbing filters on cars and
factories seems a real easy fix!!!!!! Let's be intelligent and honest , ask people what they think about the computer models used in

the calculations re Climate change.. let's face it most won't know so then it would seem you have fooled them ! God bless
