Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill








Reference no: 1804


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 If possible set emissions in to a negative value



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 It was proven that international carbon unit failed in the Emission trade scheme and even if they have strong environmental

 safeguards we should not be relying on other countries to fix our part of the mess, New Zealand puts out a green image and needs
 to regain that by increasing the amount of forest cover we have.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 No, by pushing the date further in the future is just proving that not enough effort was put into meet the target.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 The Zero Carbon Bill needs to be about the betterment of the environment and not the budget. Changes should only be made when

 they benefit the environment.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
 The Zero Carbon Bill needs to be about the betterment of the environment and not the budget. Changes should only be made when
 they benefit the environment.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes, to a degree. However, if the economist have a large say in the the budget it is likely to turn out like the emission trade scheme ...
a failure



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

Putting a strict time frame into place will give the Bill a better chance at sucess



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

While economists will be included in the planning, it needs to be clear that the environmentalist should be running the show. The
budget needs to show that it is working for the environment and not lining the wrong pockets.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
I also think that outside experts in this area should be consulted.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes
The Government allowed the Emission Trading scheme to fail and thus should let others try and fix this mess. Presuming the Climate
Change Commission is made up of the best minds when have who are knowledgeable in the environment and its economics they

should have the control to the NZ ETS



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
