Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 1169

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 Should not set an emissions target at this present time while science is inconclusive regarding the contribution of methane to

 climate change.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 2050 target should not include short-lived gases.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Notes
 We are just seeing the environmental problems caused by mass pine forrest planting as these are being harvested now. They

 increase risk of forrest fires and the forestry slash during flooding/heavy rain events. Mass planting is a huge and long term
 investment into a product which is not a proven solution.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Notes
 the Zero Carbon Bill is flawed and should not be passed.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes

 The emissions budget should not be submitted.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Notes
 The emissions budget should not be submitted.



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause

 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Position
 No

 Notes



 Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Work with farmers who are are being unfairly blamed for emissions and who will be most affected by the restrictions on their business
and life practices. The calculations for total emissions of forestry practice are not calculated accurately to include total outcomes of

the timber not just in New Zealand.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
I believe this is set out with a bias against any industry but especially farmers



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes



Clause
