Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill








Reference no: 1763


Submitter Type:   Business / Industry

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes

 There remains no real-life evidence that dangerous man-made global warming exists. The weather events that climate scientists
 highlight as being proof of runaway climate change are not outside the bounds of natural variability



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes
 There is no need to enforce this legislation as the science is not settled and the negative effect on the NZ economy will be significant




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 The targets are not required



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Notes
 as above



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause

 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause
 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The Government must consider the economic damage this Bill will cause to NZ



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Notes
There is no need for a Climate Change Commission




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
No

Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes

Notes
Agriculture will be unfairly penalised. Since livestock are carbon neutral, methane from agriculture should not be included in

emissions targets. Without methane, New Zealand would have one of the smallest greenhouse gas emissions profiles in the
developed world.




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Passing this bill is economic suicide for New Zealand.
