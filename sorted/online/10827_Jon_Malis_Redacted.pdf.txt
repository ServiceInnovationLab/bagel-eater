 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes

 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
Methane from agriculture is nearly 40% of our GHG so you have to work with farmers. Fortunately the solution exists to this problem.

Look up Zeecol for the system to turn a dairy farm into a dairy AND ENERGY farm. Farmer can turn effluent into methane for electricity
and a fuel for market. The digestate from the methane production goes to an algae farm that produces vegetable oil (diesel

substitute) algae powder that is a high tech cattle feed supplement and clean water. Too many benefits to this system to list here.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No

exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
We should be making everything we can from NZ grown raw materials ie. Wood, flax, leather, bamboo, with value added

manufacturing here in NZ. Make tax or refund incentives for buildings made of wood that might otherwise be made of steel and
concrete. Heavy timber structures ate a great carbon sink. Aklnd will be doubling population by 2050 so mandate that all buildings

between 2 and 8 storeys shall be primarily timber. Mandate fuel efficiency standards that make us transition to electric vehicles. Get
75% of trucks and trains running on algae vegetable oil instead of diesel fuel. These changes will make NZ more energy and

resource independent. Mandate end to end recyclability for all consumer products. Only the most complex e waste should leave the
island. All packaging should be of easily recyclable or compostable materials ie. Glass, steel, aluminum, paper, flax, . Every region
should have it's own local recycling facilities.
