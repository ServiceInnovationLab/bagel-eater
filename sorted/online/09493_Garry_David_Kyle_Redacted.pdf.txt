Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Garry, Garry David Kyle










Reference no: 9493


Submitter Type:

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 Government sets a flexible target based on the best science now (i.e. Zero Net Carbon by 2050) but that that target can be made
 more stringent if new science or events dictate but not less stringent.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 We cannot afford to be selective in which contributors we focus upon. Each GHG has a different degree of impact upon Climate

 Change. Within this option the main focus must be on reducing gross anthropogenic emissions of all GHGs and a secondary focus,
 to reduce net anthropogenic emissions. New Zealand’s target must be primarily guided by the Paris Agreement and by any future
 international agreements signed by the Government.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 The sad history of buying credits off-shore has shown us that they are open to fraud and therefore we must have complete control

 over the trade. In simple terms, the need to resort to purchasing international emissions can be interpreted as a state of living
 beyond one's means. Thus, what we must focus upon is real change that reflects our policy changes. There appears to be no
 international mechanism through which “strong environmental safeguards” can be guaranteed. We have to avoid being seen as

 taking the easy option of transferring our liabilities to another State.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 The target should only be changed to increase the climate action ambition in response to updated scientific information and
 recommendations. In no should change be allowed to occur that decreases our ambition. Change should only to achieve a more

 stringent limit or timeframe.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Fully support this idea. The net zero emissions must be legislated and should only face change if agreed to by 70 per cent of

 Parliament.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
Notes

These Emission Budgets are set by the Climate Commission, bearing in mind that the Commission has an independence similar to
that of the RBNZ and the setting of the OCR. The Commission can enhance the Budget if research backs the need for such a

change. Politicians should be hands off.



Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Change should not be at the whim of any Government. Any changes must be based on scientific research that has been
internationally peer reviewed. Such changes should only occur if it increases the targeted goal.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
There are a number of other objectives that should be added to proposed list of considerations: *the need to preserve healthy
ecosystem function *the need for NZ to play its genuine and just part in the international effort to stabilise the climate - we should be

providing leadership in support of the Pacific nations. *the uncertainty that exists about making future predictions in relation to
climate change




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

I believe that there should be a fixed time frame- four to five months so that public scrutiny is possible. Public scrutiny of the means
by which the Government proposes to achieve the budget is the most powerful way in which the public can be confident that

everything is legitimate and above board.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The key issues to consider are Te Tiriti o Waitangi obligations, equity and fairness, sustainable economic opportunities, technology
relevant to climate change and a sustainable Society and Economy. There needs to be recognition of the fact that economic

resources are limited and therefore economic growth as a goal is not sustainable.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

I fully support the ideas set out in the submission to this question by wise response.org.nz



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
The expertise needs to be expanded in order to be wide ranging and independent: Climate change policy (including emissions
trading) Resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour markets and distribution) Te Tiriti o Waitangii and Māori

interests Climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori Experience with addressing adaptation challenges like
planning, insurance and local government Risk management Engineering and/or infrastructure Community engagement and

communications. Knowledge of innovation and technological development and investment An appreciation of values and ethics.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
Civilisation , if it is to survive what is ahead, then we will have to be able to adapt. This should be covered by this act, but it should be

the responsibility of a separate Ministry, working closely with the Ministry of the Environment and DOC



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Lets get on with it. This is an important issue which requires immediate action. We have wasted enough time thanks to the NATS.
