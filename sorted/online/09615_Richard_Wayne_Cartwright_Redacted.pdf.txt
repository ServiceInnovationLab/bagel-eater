Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Richard Wayne Cartwright








Reference no: 9615

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 A specific target is needed immediately because the need for reduction is urgent



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived

 gases
 Notes
 Mitigation of gas emissions from combusting fossil fuels and emissions from modifications to the carbon cycle - principally methane

 from ruminant animals - require totally different policies. Hence, targets for them must be separated. The targets are very different: 1.
 Reduce combustion of fossil fuels to zero, including offsets by forest sequestration. 2. Reduce methane emissions through

 incentives for alternative uses of land. Methane degrades to carbon dioxide over about 10 years, so the term 'short lived gases' is
 misleading.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 NZ must play its part without relying on offsets from elsewhere.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Circumstances can only become worse. Hence, revise targets only by making them more urgent.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 This approach is more strategic and requires more detailed analysis, which is needed.




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes

 Budgets can be changed only by tightening them.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
Yes

Notes
As for (6)




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
Targets without strategic plans have little meaning or effect.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Plans for meeting budgets must recognise that they will be implemented while adaptation is also taking place.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes
Adaptation to already 'locked in' climate change and mitigation of further climate change are part of the same global and local

systems. Hence, the Climate Change Commission should have oversight of the NZ response to both. In the medium term, adaptation
to climate change will require more attention than mitigation. All mitigation strategies will be implemented in while adaptation is also

taking place.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

I agree with them but much stronger approaches will actually be required.
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

Adaptation will require future insight to anticipate what will need to be done, then preparing for these actions in advance. All relevant
information that contributes to this should be readily available.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Ensure that this legislation creates a sound and resilient base for further developments as the need for them are anticipated. Add a
provision that requires establishment and continual refinement of Climate Change Future Insight, the scope of which is determined

by the needs of NZ decision-makers, both public and private.
