Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Philip Morgan






Reference no: 10892


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes
 Methane emissions are at net zero when the level of emissions are stable (which it is now). This carbon dioxide equivalent system is
 flawed. Over one third of these carbon emissions are fictional because methane is so over-stated. Most, if any, of these methane

 emissions don't alter composition of atmosphere.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 No

 Notes
 Do these budgets cover CO2 sequestered by trees, soil etc on agricultural land against NTO and any net increase in atmospheric
 methane? e.g. net emissions for farmers, also land covered with concrete and asphalt in city areas



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes

 None of the above. Any budget should be able to be altered as technical/scientific/economic/social/energy etc events happen and
 change.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes

 None of the above. As per question 6



 Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

No
Notes

As per question 6 in regard to budgets



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Food and security v global warming. Costs incurred on everyone e.g. power. Emissions moving overseas e.g. businesses moving
overseas. Use of GMO, nuclear energy to replace fossil fuels?



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
Depends what the measurements are based on



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Notes
Neither, methane emitters treated unfairly in ETS e.g. Air NZ could offset carbon with tree planting, pay no ETS - farmers with stable

stock numbers have net zero methane emissions however will still pay ETS



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes

More people with crystal balls!!



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Energy - loss of fossil fuels. What's to be used for industry, the powering of electric cars, domestic consumption. What is a low cost

alternative, nuclear? Updating of RMA to allow more dams, solar, wind and nuclear and GMO alternatives. Where does the billions of
funds that flow from fossil fuels and agriculture come from after they have been disrupted? Green manufacturing will go to Asia where
they have cheap coal power (60 plants built in the last 2 years). Expensive green innovation will go to where the main capital (money)

is. Who gets the billions that countries will be paying (based on flawed science) and what will the people be left with? The non-
security of food and energy leads to civil unrest.
