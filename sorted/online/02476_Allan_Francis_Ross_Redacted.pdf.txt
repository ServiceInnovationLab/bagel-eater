Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Same, Allan Francis Ross






Reference no: 2476


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later

 Notes
 This will allow for a better review of public and scientific opinion to be considered, including the option abandon the target.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Notes
 Set an intent to reduce it, but not by a specific amount



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 Pragmatic application that does not sacrifice our economy or reduce productivity



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 Given that the Paris Accord is collapsing and largely non-binding, and that the largest emitters such as China and India are forging
 ahead with emissions that overwhelm any reductions we make, we should not commit so far out



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

No
Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
We should be cognisant of the rapidly fragmenting global agreements to commit, the inability of other countries to achieve their
targets, and the lack of consequences of not complying with Paris accord or other such targets. We should consider the steadily

increasing number of scientific publications which cast huge doubt on the theory of AGW.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Needs to include experts from the sceptical science sector, there are many highly qualified individuals both in NZ and globally.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No
Notes

What climate change?



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
No
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Do not sacrifice our national economy for the virtue-signalling changes proposed. There is too much doubt about the relationship of
CO2 to 'climate change', NZ's total emissions are so small as not to make any difference to the global emissions budget, and our own

emissions do not effect our own climate as they blow away. If we really want to have a nuclear moment, perhaps we should consider
admitting that CO2 is not pollution, and has such a tiny effect on climate that we should just accept the cost of adjusting and
adapting as a cheaper and better return on our investment.
