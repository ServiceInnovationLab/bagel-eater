Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Ken Tod








Reference no: 12275

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 The government should not be setting any targets at all. There is no evidence that supports the theory that the level of carbon

 dioxide in the atmosphere affects the earth's climate.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 The best target is no target. Our carbon emissions on world wide scale are minimal and cancelled out but emissions from larger
 emitters such as India, China, Russia.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 Withdraw from the Paris Agreement and put the money saved into supporting work to return the natural environment to it's best and
 forget about climate change. Climate change is an natural cycle that is very complex and not well understood by the scientific
 community. Climate change will occur regardless of what we do.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Notes

 The bill should not go ahead at all. It's just virtue signalling and a sop to the Greens.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Notes
 I do not agree that any targets need to be set. Refer to my earlier answers.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes

 The government should cut taxes for everyone and trim it's own expenditure. Forget about emissions.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Notes
 Get onto things that are important such as reforming the RMA to enable more housing to be built. That's more important than a

 fantasy about affecting climate change.



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes
 No agreement on any considerations or actions taken by this government all all since it came into power. Reinstate the Oil and Gas

 industry, that will do more for the country overall than this load of nonsense.



 Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Notes
This government has proven itself unable to plan and has done away with the targets in various areas the previous government had,

such as in Health. Setting out plans would all be for show anyway. you will not measure anything and will falsify any results anyway.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The most important issues for the government to consider is not to make a whole range of uncosted promises and then tax the living
daylights out of the country to try and pay for them.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
Time to reduce the number of useless commissions, might as well start with this one.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Notes
Scrap the commission and scrap the NZ ETS, it's a total waste of time and taxpayer's money



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
Scrap this commission, it's just the latest in the hundreds of inquiries, committees and commissions that have been set up to waste

taxpayer money while looking like you're doing something, yet achieving nothing.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Notes
We do not need a Zero Carbon bill. We can adapt to climate change without it.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
Government and local government should stick to its knitting and stop inventing new ways of wasting taxpayer's money.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Notes
No - more time wasting and wasting taxpayer dollars




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Before taking any action to interfere with the national economy or the lifestyle of its citizens, the government should provide
irrefutable proof that human production of carbon dioxide in New Zealand is harmful to humans or any other lifeforms in New Zealand.
