Notes

I co-chair the Lancet Commission on Obesity which defines The Global Syndemic of obesity, under nutrition and climate change as
the biggest current and future threat to health. A syndemic is a synergy of epidemics which interact and have common societal

causes. There are many common drivers between climate change and obesity which need to be recognised. Both are mediated by
human overconsumption which in turn is driven by consumptogenic environments ie the easy and default choices and even desired

choices (for GDP growth) are to over-consume. The Commission MUST have a deep view of the fundamental drivers of over
consumption and recommend and monitor policies and actions. Deep actions include: preventing powerful vested commercial

interests from influencing policy development; circular economy systems which internalise externalities; systems analyses of the
problems with systemic solutions; powerful accountability systems to hold actors to account (government, industry, consumers);
alleviation of poverty etc. the full report of the Lancet Commission will be available in early 2019.
