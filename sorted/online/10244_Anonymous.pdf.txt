Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 10244

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 Any means possible. Sorry, I will have to leave this for the scientific experts in the area to determine. If that includes foreign reductions

 included, so be it. Just whatever will work fastest & best.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 If it's possible to do it by 2030, then do it. By that I mean, if it's possible to do this earlier rather than later, lets do this. We are already
 2 decades behind the ball.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes
 Yes - but only if the subsequent change is to speed up the process. Any attempt to slow or derail the process should be punishable

 with death (just jokes).



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Yes - only if it's to make our target emission reductions & time frame more ambitious.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Work with every sector of society. If what we do adversely affects those in most need, then we need to nail down other areas that will

lessen the affects on these people. NO sector shall be excluded, not the least the transport & agriculture sectors on some false
equivalency claim that they're providing NZ with the means to be a modern economy.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

Or option D, a mixture of advisory role & policy direction leading? Not sure. If I could TRUST a conservative government to do anything
right I'd say this is the Govts role. But considering I have zero trust in these people to do anything that is in the public or

environmental good, then I'd be skeptical of giving these roles to Govt. But of course, then we are giving a lot of power to a small
group of officials... Good question.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
If no, why undergo this exercise if we are only going to cover one half of the issue.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
Hiding behind 'commercial sensitivity' is a cop-out. There's a reason why Tragedy of the Commons should be compulsory in schools

again, we are all in this together, not some 'special' exclusions.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Ever since I was a spotty Geography student at Linwood High School in ChCh in the mid 1980s, doing my research project of particle

emissions in ChCh's infamous winter smog, the problems of pollution & it's adverse affect on humanity & the environment, it's been
pretty bloody evident that we need change. Going on to do a Geography degree at Canty Uni, studying under some of NZ's most
preeminent scholars in the area of Climate Change & human impact on the environment, the clear message in the late 1980s was

we were already too late to save us from ourselves. Honestly, 40 years later, that we are still having this 'debate' it beggars belief. But
then after nearly a decade of belittling science & academics (re the disgusting personal attacks on the likes of Dr Mike Joy), I can see

how we are at this point. We need RADICAL change. In my humble, but educated opinion, we are too late to the party, but better late
than never. Whatever we can do to make this process faster (yet scientifically rigorous), the better. I'm in awe of places like University

of British Columbia, where I am fortunate to have lived 5x since 1999, which has these goals already in place (some time ago). Some
say, so what, a University can do it. When the University year is underway, including the retirement homes, condos, student

accommodation & daily staff & students on site, UBC has an on site population of 110,000 people, or the same size roughly of
Dunedin. Does Dunedin have a ZERO emissions plan in place... We are well behind the ball on this one. But in order to combat the
inevitable big money back-lash, fronted by idiot conservative sock puppets, we must have a public education programme to

accompany this. When I was a teacher, I included the Tragedy of the Commons in all my units of teaching, this is an increasingly rare
feat these days. Civics education, with concepts of Te Triti & Tragedy of the Commons must be core to this. The general public must

be educated on this, they need to be able to buy into what they are doing & shown the benefits of it. In short, we are 30-40 years
behind the ball, do this, do it properly & do it now, but hurry up would ya? Many thanks.
