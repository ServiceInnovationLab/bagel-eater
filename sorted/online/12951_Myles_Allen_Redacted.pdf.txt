Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Reference no: 12951


Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later

 Notes
 Meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement requires net zero emissions by the time global temperatures reach "well below 2C" and
 potentially as low as 1.5C. When this will occur remains unknown, but it may be as soon as mid-century. The Government may wish to

 consider building flexibility into the Act to allow the date of net zero to be adjusted as the climate response emerges, although clarity
 regarding the temperature goal (e.g. net zero emissions by the time global temperatures reach 1.5C above pre-industrial, defined as
 the average 1850-1900) would be helpful.




 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes
 See our submission: Submission_ZCA_Allen.pdf: reducing the contribution of New Zealand's emissions to the increase in global
 average surface temperature to zero requires net zero emissions of long-lived gases including carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, and

 gradually declining (at approximately 0.4% per year) emissions of the short-lived gas methane. This is equivalent to net zero
 emissions across all gases if aggregated using the science-based GWP* metric.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes
 This is a political decision: as a non-New-Zealander, I am unqualified to comment.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 An explicit mention of global temperature in the Act would address the possibility that warming may occur faster, or slower, than

 current estimates suggest: the ultimate goal of the Act is to limit New Zealand's contribution to warming, not warming by any
 particular date. Allowing the timing of net zero to adjust to the emerging temperature response would address this issue, although it

 would be helpful for planning to make clear that net zero emissions will still be required at some point, likely early in the second half of
 this century if the more ambitious interpretation of the Paris long-term temperature goal is adopted.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Notes

 As a non-New-Zealander, I am unqualified to comment.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes

 See response to Q4: an explicit mention of the evolution of global average surface temperature and human-induced warming might
 be helpful in both the budget-setting and revision process.
Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

See response to Q4: an explicit mention of the evolution of global average surface temperature and human-induced warming might
be helpful in both the budget-setting and revision process.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
See response to Q4: an explicit mention of the evolution of global average surface temperature and human-induced warming might
be helpful in both the budget-setting and revision process.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Notes
As a non-New-Zealander, I am unqualified to comment.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The global academic community is very willing to help support the New Zealand government in framing a science-based climate

change mitigation programme.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

As a non-New-Zealander, I am unqualified to comment.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes

As a non-New-Zealander, I am unqualified to comment.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

As a non-New-Zealander, I am unqualified to comment.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Notes
As a non-New-Zealander, I am unqualified to comment.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Notes
As a non-New-Zealander, I am unqualified to comment.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Notes
As a non-New-Zealander, I am unqualified to comment.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
