Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Anthony Weddle




Reference no: 1202

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes




 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No
 Notes

 It should not take into account economic considerations in setting/advising on budgets as the economy is ephemeral whilst the
 environment is for ever. Of course, we need to then set strategies on how to cope with the economic impacts but they should not
 have a major role in setting the budgets.
Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
ASAP




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The obvious issue is how to meet the target, through the budgets.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
It depends on how the commission is set up. It needs to operate independent of government but be accountable to the people.

However, there needs to be cross party support for the commissions's operating parameters so that it can then operate to meet the
stated goal and set policy, in consultation with, but independent of, government.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

I don't think expertise is needed in the supposed needs of certain sectors of the population, since climate change is something that
affects the population, as a whole. Other than that, it needs expertise in the science of climate change and some expertise in the
methods of addressing it.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes

The climate will change markedly, regardless of what we do so we need an adaptation strategy.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

Yes but don't include phrases like "sustainably growing the economy"; it is not possible to sustainably grow an economy, so it should
not be a consideration.




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Just to reiterate that climate change is probably the most (but not only) environmental crisis that we face, and there is a risk of its
turning into an existential crisis. We should concentrate on removing our contribution to climate change forcing. We should also note

that the impacts of climate change may not change because of our actions in this country alone, so adaptation strategies should,
initially, assume that climate change will continue to track on the worst case scenario.
