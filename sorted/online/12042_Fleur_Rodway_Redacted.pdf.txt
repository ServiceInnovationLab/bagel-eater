Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Fleur Rodway




Reference no: 12042

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes




 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 The adverse effects of exotic plantation forestry must be carefully considered. Indigenous forest should be a significant component

 of any forest planting.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 What sanctions will be applied if budgets are exceeded?



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No
 Notes




 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Economic effects must be measured broadly and not over short timeframes - a narrow assessment of economic effects (such as
GDP) will give a false view of the true costs of any emissions budget and may lead to budgets that are not ambitious enough to meet

a net zero target.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Children and young people, MƒÅori, our Pacific neighbours - particularly those countries that are already being impacted by rising sea
levels.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Social impacts should not be assessed from a simple economic perspective - social science may provide beneficial perspectives.
Behavioural science and psychology may add useful perspectives as well.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
