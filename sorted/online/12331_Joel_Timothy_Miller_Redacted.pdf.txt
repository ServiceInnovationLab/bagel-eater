Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Joel Timothy Miller








Reference no: 12331

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 We need to be clear that the goal is to reach net zero emissions by 2050. If appropriate, the experts at the independent Climate
 Change Commission could advise the government of the day to revise the target if new information becomes available.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases
 Notes

 This is a tricky question, with many different views. My understanding is that it certainly makes sense from a scientific perspective to
 treat methane different from other emissions. However this doesn't mean we shouldn't also be trying to immediately cut methane

 emissions. I would say we need to immediately cut the amount of methane in parallel with carbon dioxide, but the end stabilised
 target doesn't necessarily need to be net zero.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 I'm not convinced that we can rely on overseas reductions. We should close our ETS to international trade. Our priority should be to
 get New Zealand to net zero emissions. the



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 If circumstances change and the experts at the Climate Change Commission agree, then of course. The tricky thing will be to make

 this immune from political interference.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Giving certainly to businesses seems like a good idea, so they can tailor their investments accordingly.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes
 We don't want our mitigation strategy to open to political interference. Only when recommended by the experts should budgets be

 changed.



 Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Again, only on the advice of the Climate Commission.



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

Mostly meeting emissions budgets should be up to the market and the ETS. But governments can obviously help provide further
incentives and protect against market failures.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Infrastructure investment is one big area where the Government clearly needs to play a role. There's no point in investing in roads if a
high carbon price makes them uneconomical to use in the future.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

It's important that the settings of carbon budgets is not open to political interference.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
