Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Jason Garman








Reference no: 1830

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 Physics doesn't negotiate with different gas types. They all cause warming, they must all come down to net zero.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 Overseas carbon credit schemes have long proven to be not good enough.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Yes, but only revising the target to below net zero, or bringing the net zero date forward to sooner than 2050.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes

 Yes, but the budget should ONLY be able to be altered down, to be more ambitious in emissions reductions. This has to be a race to
 the top in ambition, not a race to the bottom. No government should be able to weaken the ambition of a previous government.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Yes, but the budget should ONLY be able to be altered down, to be more ambitious in emissions reductions. This has to be a race to
 the top in ambition, not a race to the bottom. No government should be able to weaken the ambition of a previous government.
Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Climate Change is a global problem – it cannot be tackled by countries in isolation. New Zealand must demonstrate global leadership
and match its bold domestic emissions reduction agenda: by having an equally ambitious climate change strategy abroad. Access to

climate finance is a matter of climate justice – those who have contributed least to the causes of climate change are typically the
most vulnerable to its impacts and have the least resources to respond. We must take responsibility for our global emissions and the

climate impacts that we have contributed to. It’s very important that all New Zealanders have their say on how we make the shift to a
zero carbon future here in New Zealand but we must also help the world’s most vulnerable communities across the Pacific adjust to

the impacts on climate change. We must ensure that the Zero Carbon Bill is transparent. This means the bill must include a
requirement to produce annual reports about New Zealand’s international climate change contributions in order to ensure that the
Pacific countries get the support they need and can plan to adapt to their changing environment. Transparency in the Bill will promote

public engagement and political accountability. New Zealanders will be able to understand the international contributions we are
making and as a nation, we will be able to stand tall that we are supporting our Pacific neighbours adapt to their climate change reality.

New Zealand has demonstrated global leadership with our commitment to stopping oil and gas exploration – now let us continue that
moral leadership and include transparency in what and how we support climate change efforts abroad, particularly in the Pacific.
