Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 596

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 Draw a line in the sand NOW.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived

 gases
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 No idea what change this could mean, excess CO2 is not sustainable, it is a symptom of a dysfunctional non symbiotic system that
 ignores the need for balance to benefit ALL.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 Set budgets mean clarity and ability to plan. I also would not trust another government to keep us on track.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
 Set a bold brave budget, so it brings about change.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

Time is not on our side, we need to take bold step and encourage other nations to follow.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Existing industry, working with , not doing thing to them. Youth, generate ideas for their world. Transport- you must incentivise EV
uptake and promote the benefits, start to quash the myths: huge benefits when one person become empowered by one action,

then we'll see snowball effect of awesome!



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Transparency is key, accountability is key. If the Climate Change Commission are truly independent this can be great.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
We can control what we do, but we are sadly not able to demand others behave appropriately. We are in a vulnerable place, for

extremes of weather to a place for climate refugees, this need planning for.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
Collaboration will help build a robust reliable system.




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Be brave and bold, take a stand for the future. Changing the rules will encourage new innovations and tech, we can be at the front of

this exciting and essential shift in how we work with our planet to sustain our selves and those we share, if we change the rules we
work by.
