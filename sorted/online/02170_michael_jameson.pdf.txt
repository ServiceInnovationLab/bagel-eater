Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Michael McRobie Jameson









Reference no: 2170

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes

 I do not believe that the science that says CO2 is the sole source of Global Warming. Indeed has the IPCC or the Paris Accord
 specified what the density of CO2 in the atmosphere should be?Trying to set a country's target without a global target makes no
 sense at all, particularly when any of the reductions being proposed are going to reduce New Zealand's GDP by up to 22%.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 The target should be set ONLY AFTER it is clearly established that CO2 density.is clearly linked to hemispherical temperature control;
 the sensitivity of hemispherical temperature in relation to CO2 density; and the density that is to be attained to maintain
 temperatures, is specified and internationally accepted. It is difficult to believe however that the rise in CO2 density between 1958

 and 2017 [310 ppm to 400 ppm], a .00009% increase, is solely responsible for the temperature rises.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Notes
 Who, apart from the Minister and his entourage, says New Zealand should have an established target of zero emissions? Such a
 move, which will reduce the wealth of its citizens, seemingly to set an "example" to the rest of the world, seems to be a poor return

 for our Country.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Notes
 The Bill should NOT SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY!!!!



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes

 This Government clearly does not have the welfare of New Zealand citizens within their philosophy when they recognise that there
 will be increased hardship by the poorest of our Country, but they propose to offset this by welfare payments being made from the
 reducing GDP. This seems to be Marxist wealth redistribution in disguise.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes

 There should be NO EMISSION BUDGET set until the sensitivity of climate change to CO2 density is clearly established and an agreed
 Global CO2 density is established!



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes

 What is the point of reviewing something that should not be established until the sensitivity of climate to CO2 is able to be quantified
 and proven!!
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

How about some proper science, not science based on manipulated data and alarmist statements talking about 70 cm sea rise. An
Australian study, based on some 69 measuring points around the Australian coastline, estimates a 3 - 5 cm rise this century. The

Minister wishes to incorporate agriculture emissions into the mix because of methane and CO2 release. Is he also intending to
include humans who exhale CO2 at a density of 40,000 ppm at every breath cycle?



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

No
Notes
How can any Government set plans when the emission budgets are entirely artificial, and such budgets are going to result in

reducing the Country's wealth by up to 22%



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
WORK WITH: 1. The 68% of climatologists who currently do not support the theory that CO2 emissions are the sole source of climate
change; and 2. Climate model makers that are able to produce predictions that are believable and do not manipulate data. ITEMS

FOR CONSIDERATION: 1. Maintenance of the economy in a growth mode; 2. Cease attempting to ameliorate introduced hardships by
wealth redistribution; 3. Work with the Country's citizens; and 4. Prove to citizens that CO2 Density is the prime influence on

hemispherical temperatures [32% of climatologists in agreement is NOT enough];



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

The only thing the Commission should be advising on is what best science is able to predict with at least a 75% certainty of what
aspects and their most probable extent, will be impacted on by climate change in order to assist in the preparation of amelioration of

the threats.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes

NONE - The need for a trading scheme has the same merit as Canute had in holding back the tide and only helps contribute to
increasing costs for no real return.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
Climatologists, Physicists, Geologists, Biologists, Economists, Industrialists, and Engineers. There is no need for specific Maori
membership or consideration as their needs are no different to any other New Zealand Citizen




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No
Notes

All that could be included at the moment is generalities without any certain level of impact. Adaption can only come after better
science is able to predict with a greater level of certainty.
Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

The proposed functions in and of themselves appear to be sensible, but they must be backed by science that has at least a 70%
certainty in order to be meaningful and relevant. We are a long way from that situation and this is where research and development

should be directed before we embark on a programme that weakens our economy.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes
Setting up TARGETED ADAPTION reporting power sounds a bit like HG Wells "1984" . Once SCIENCE and NOT POLITICAL IDEOLOGY is

driving our research, then if reporting is justified the individuals and organisations that need to contribute will readily see and become
engaged without "Big Brother" driving them.




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
I thought that there was supposed to a DISCUSSION, but in fact we are required to accept the Minister is correct - CO2 Emissions are
the cause of all our problems - and only discuss how far are we prepared to go to restrict its release to atmosphere. I think the

discussion needs to start a few steps earlier before we start to close down our economy!!!!!. I also think that all citizens need be
given real data, not subjective ideology and alarmist statements, so that they are able to endorse or discard the shrinking of our

economy by way of binding referendum. At the very least, they need to have a clear picture of what life in our country will look like with
the withdrawal hydrocarbons [the most cost efficient and concentrated source of energy currently available to humanity], and a clear

plan on how this energy source will be replaced given that: 1. wind and solar energy require more energy and resources to
manufacture than they are able to generate [ask Germany and Scandinavia who have said that these scources cannot replace
hydrocarbons]; 2. Nuclear energy is currently denied to New Zealanders by current legislation; and 3. Hydro energy resources are all-

but at maximum capacity. How any Government could deliberately commit its population to a reducing standard of living is difficult to
comprehend. It is time to STOP treating CO2 as a pollutant - it is not. ASK ANY PLANT!
