Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Christine Ellen Henderson, Christine Ellen Henderson






Reference no: 11762


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes
 Short lived gases are fueled to a greater or lesser degree by intensive dairying and the overuse or urea. Going back to a clover-based
 source of nitrogen and reducing animal numbers to the carrying capacity of the soil need to be immediate steps.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 We need to undertake practical projects that actually reduce domestic emissions. No entity should be absolved of it's responsibilities

 by being able to offset emissions by buying overseas carbon credits.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 It would make sense to have the ability to revise targets if opportunities arise which enabled us to speed up the process and reduce
 the time line.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 The ability to select the 'low-hanging fruit' such as tree planting , energy efficiency, increased public transport, coastal shipping,
 increased rail use for passengers as well as freight, import substitution, and other low carbon initiatives in the first five years, buys
 time to work through the next two stages to ensure systems are set up to meet the 2050 target.




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes

 Bi-partisan agreement between all Political Parties is essential from the outset, and any changes must be ratified by the Government
 of the day following meaningful consultation of all interested Governmental and non-Governmental groups.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

I have not read the Discussion Document but the principle is sound. Again, there needs to be a general consensus before the
budget is finalised.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes, it is five minutes to Midnight. We do not have the luxury of procrastination.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

All sectors need to work with the Government. The Agriculture Sector needs to implement practical projects to offset it's emissions,
such as planting appropriate tree species or protecting native areas, with assistance from Government for fencing materials. The

equivalent of 10 percent of any farm planted in trees (or equivalent) is sufficient to offset the farm's carbon footprint according to a
Ministry of Forestry report of some years ago. Carbon credits could be the reward for agricultural carbon sequestration initiatives that
are permanent. The agricultural sector should be prepared to pay a carbon tax on fuel in line with all other groups and individuals.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Again, without having read the document I can see the sense in the Commission having this function. It may also be helpful for the

Commission to have a reference group made up of environmental groups to liase with.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
The level of expertise in the sciences would be essential, also social policy, communication skills and lateral thinking! Again, a

carefully chosen reference group could support the Commission.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes, as adaptation will be one of the strategies required to cope with changed conditions in the future.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
It is essential that organisations declare their concerns in order to future proof them. Insurance companies will have a major role in

shaping our society, as will Banks, for instance.
Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
New Zealanders are a practical people. I would hope that moving into a low carbon economy will be the catalyst for a sustainable

future where Climate Change is at the forefront of planning. The Government can play an important role in leading by example. For
instance, purchasing wool for carpets and insulation in all Government buildings, enacting legislation to require packaging to be fit for

purpose, restoring rivers dammed for electricity to ecosystem health, introducing progressive power pricing, ensuring education for
life, maintaining the Predator Free initiative- which also assists native forest carbon sequestration, restoration of rail passenger

services for the South island, emphasis on rainwater harvest rather than aquifer mining, assistance with funding for regional upgrades
of wastewater facilities, and an emphasis on value-added rather than an economy based on commodities. Taking the pressure of our
natural world must be part of our Climate change policy. I am much heartened by the determination of so many to make positive

changes for the sake of our Planet and future generations. Thank you for the opportunity to submit to this Proposal.
