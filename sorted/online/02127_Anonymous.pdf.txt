Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 2127

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 Act NOW! Stop procrastinating.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 Given our high rates of methane emissions AND high transport emissions per capita, this country needs to reduce all greenhouse
 gases.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 Stop treating climate change as a business and start acting as if our lives depend on sound long-term solutions. This is OUR

 problem.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 The chances of us over-reacting would appear to be far less than the history of under-reacting.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 I just want a realistic budget that will actually effect change for the better.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes
 It is high time we got real about long-term planning for our environment ...we've decimated the country since our arrival and it is time

 to 'make good', before there's nothing left to make good.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
But only to increase it ...the legislation should be untouchable by future governments.




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Business should be less a factor than it has historically been -as it's 'business as usual' that has got us into this mess in the first

place.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
Do something useful NOW! Stop destroying our environment in the name of big business.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The people, the land, the future...




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
We need a body that is above all the petty trade-offs that businesses and politicians have made to slow down any progress towards

making the necessary changes to actually halt emissions.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes

We shouldn't have a trading scheme ...it's too late for all that rubbish.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Just base it on real, peer-reviewed, properly researched science.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

I doubt that it goes far enough ...increased risk of major weather events, rising sea levels, fluctuating temperatures and the effects all
of this, and more, will have on our ability to survive. Personally, I still want to see this country and my children (and future generations)

thriving, not merely surviving.
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Re-Plant forests (native, not introduced species), do more to save what little we've got left after nearly two centuries of decimating
this country. Stop destroying our waterways and natural environments for big business and start REALLY thinking about the future!!! I

do not wish my name to be published or my comments be posted on any websites, as I am not a climate-change expert and these
are my (reasonably informed but not expert) opinions.
