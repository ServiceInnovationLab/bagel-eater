Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Ottilie Stolte






Reference no: 9446


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 Our first priority should be to decarbonise our electricity, energy and transport systems. We should have a ‘firewall’, in which NZ’s
 emissions must reach zero domestically, rather than relying on international credits. In NZ we have many advantages and should be

 leading not lagging in terms of our climate action.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 The only revision permitted should be to bring the 2050 target date earlier.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 That would allow us to track progress and see what actions we need to be taking to meet our commitments.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
 Notes
 Climate change is here and we need to act.



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
not sure and don't have the time to research this.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes, we should be aiming for an earlier target than 2050. For example, we could strengthen our 2030 Paris Agreement target to
demonstrate that we are serious about our emissions reduction response.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
We need to ensure that we can redirect infrastructure development. For example, working with central and local government to divert

investment in roads to instead bolster investment in public and active modes of transportation. We need government to incentivise
clean and sustainable industries and bring in polluter charges. That will help us to transition our economy and society away from old

polluting activities to new sustainable practices. As it is, disruptive technologies are coming (e.g. in food production and transport)
and we need to adjust both for environmental and economic reasons - otherwise we will be left behind.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

We need to ensure transparency and accountability and reduce the risk of people finding loopholes and 'work arounds' that allow
them to continue polluting practices.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
It should not have over-riding power given its undemocratic nature.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
not sure




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No
Notes

Its too late for this. We need to reduce carbon emissions and not waste time and money trying to avoid our global responsibilities.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Not sure and don't have the time to research this.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

NZ might be a small player globally, but we have among the highest per capita emissions. We need to take responsibility and reduce
our emissions. Shifting to a low carbon future by reducing emissions should be our main priority. Not trying to find ways to continue

business as usual. We are already seeing serious climate change with only 1 degree of warming so need to act now. A sustainable
low carbon economy and society has so many other benefits to the health of people and the planet. This is the future and we will be

left behind and we risk our international reputation if we stick to intensive methane producing agriculture and a car-dependent
society. The sooner we act the smoother this transition will be.
