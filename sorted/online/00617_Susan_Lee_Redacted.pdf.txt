 Business sector - no jobs, no taxes to support this. Also, this is going to impact poorer people and fixed income types, big time.

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
Aims to change commercial, transport and domestic energy sources from "fossil fuels" to "electricity" are inane. Electricity is not an

energy source but a vector of energy. You have to produce it somehow. And since we want to increase forestry, where is this
"biomass" going to come from? Food crops are going to be needed for food, especially in the shrunken economy forecast. Hmm, an

d also I see the Cow Anti Fart Vaccine is still in "development" and has been for 17 years, not that hopeful. But my biggest gripe is, we
are stopping natural gas exploration and happily burning coal! Just like Germany, so that we can have electric cars - this is mad! No,

wait, it's politics...
