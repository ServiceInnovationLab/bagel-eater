Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Peter Bacchus, Soil to Soul (Peter Michael Bacchus)








Reference no: 7272

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Carbon Dioxide - Reducing net carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2050

 Notes
 If we got on with the job it could happen a lot quicker than envisaged



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 forests should be species diverse as in our native forest. Agriculture can play a significant role by implementing regenerative and or
 biolgical farming systems. I can more than double carbon uptake in as little as twenty four hours and long term improvements can be

 made on that.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Yes it could happen a lot quicker than that if we got on with the job on all fronts instead of just talking about it. Unbelievably significant
 changes can be made within a decade of adoption.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 It is great to keep everyone informed all the time.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes

 There is always room for improvement.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 so long as it is an improvement, definitely no backsliding!!!



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes

These time frames may need to be adjusted as things may well progress faster than expected at present.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

getting accurate information and looking outside the currently accepted circle of experts.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes
We should not be trading emissions rather focus on reducing and increasing the uptake of carbondioxide from the atmosphere by

the best method possible with the view of doubling soil carbon with the next decade. that is over and above carbon stored in trees. It
only takes an unfortunate fire and all that carbon is returned to the atmosphere.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes
It does not contain the expertise for returning carbon to the soil at the greatest possible rate. In New Zealand this is VITAL!!!




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes we need to learn to live and work differently. Judging by the wild fires in Western U. S. A. we will have warmer water round us for a
few years yet which will change our weather patterns, especially in summer




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

Information sharing is important to public buy in



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Please do not plant more Pinus Radiata!! we have far to many already. We need trees that make quality timber not sap wood that is

dependent of chemicals for durability. Farms can have up to one third of the area planted in trees and grow more grass. We need a
much more integrated landscape according to the capabilities of the land
