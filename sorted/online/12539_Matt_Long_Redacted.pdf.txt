Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Matt Long









Reference no: 12539

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases
 Notes




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

 its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

The commission must, if we are serious about mitigating climate change rather than creating a political smokescreen, have on board
expertise on Soil Carbon Sequestration



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

I'm very disappointed that there is no reference to Soil Carbon in this paper. While Carbon emissions from soil pale beside fossil fuel
emissions they are a significant contributor, with estimates ranging from 40-500 billion tons of carbon lost during the industrial

revolution period. The loss of soil carbon also contributes to water pollution, loss of nutrient and water holding capacity of soils,
(Reduced yields and increased droughts.) and increases flood damage during heavy rain events. (Again through a lack of water

holding capacity.) The science is strong that the following factors cause loss of soil carbon. 1. Cultivation and erosion. 2. Overgrazing.
3. Loss of fertility. 4. Forestation. 5. Over application of synthetic nitrogen fertiliser. The exciting thing about soil carbon is that by good
management it can easily be increased and governments around the world are recognising this. This increase can be easily

measured and a robust measuring system down to a metre's depth has been successfully developed in New Zealand by Peter Floyd.
No country is better placed to increase soil carbon than New Zealand because of our extensive pastoral grazing land, and proper

management of this soil carbon will easily enable us to meet a zero net carbon emission target well ahead of the targets set out in
this bill. To achieve this we need a government that takes Climate Change and the Environment seriously, we need individual farmers

to be incentivised to increase their soil carbon by access to carbon credits for soil carbon, and we need a robust measuring system
such as Peter Floyd has developed to be adopted as a national standard for recognition of soil carbon at an individual farm level.
