Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 649

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 2nd half of Century is somewhere between 2050 and 2100, too vague. Too far off to have any accountability from anyone. Most of us
 will won`t be alive then....



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 Stretch Target, best to aim high and get decision making process underway, otherwise there will be a trend too push out the

 deadline for other long lived gases.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 Keep it local, don`t get lost in the international carbon credit trading schemes , which are prime for abuse and corruption. If carbon
 credits are given, make it from local carbon sinks only.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Only if the scientific concensus changes and new facts/information is gained,



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Makes sense to have a planned budget in place



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes

 Provided the overall plans and goals stay the same for 2050. New governments still need to have control of budget allocation.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
Provided the overall plans and goals stay the same for 2050. New governments still need to have control of budget allocation.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes

Of course, without a plan it wont happen. The plan needs a high level of accountability.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

We know what we want to do. We need the people (engineers, scientists) to advise on how we do it. Once we know the how , then
we can plan and budget for this.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes
Commision can advise on progress and outcomes. Independant parties would be best to track actual process and keep the system

honest and unbiased.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Entirely agree, we need leaders with essential technical expertise on how to overcome the problem. High level standing is irrelevant,

we need Leaders with expertise on how to solve a problem. Aiming for carbon neutrality is not a race/cultural problem. Keep
race/culture, sex, religion out of the equation when selecting commissioner, go by merit, not race or culture.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes

Its another important issue, but focus of group will become cloudy, if extending focus. Would be better to have another separate
panel to focus on the other important issue of climate change.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

I think by fully understanding the risks and consequences to our current lifestyles and getting that information into the public domain,
will get better buy in from the public of why we are trying to reduce the risks, and the consequences of doing nothing.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes
