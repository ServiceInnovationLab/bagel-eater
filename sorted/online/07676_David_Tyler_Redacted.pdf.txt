               David Tyler






Reference no: 7676


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes

 Question dosnt make sense to me. The goal/target is surely set already as net zero emissions by 2050.If not this is what it should be.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 Very silly question. Why make a half hearted effort when the survival of our species is at risk



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 Target may need to bought forward if/when we believe it is set too far out to save the Planet from such change which could no longer
 support life forms



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes

 This is a question for the Govt.but it should not be allowed to relax targets or budgets. because the science may be underrating the
 hazards.



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
