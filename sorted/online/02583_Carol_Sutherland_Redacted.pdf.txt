Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Carol Sutherland






Reference no: 2583


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 otherwise the commission will be merely today's tokenism that will soon be a sidelined office somewhere in the commission industry



 Clause
 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
 Notes
 R&D Also consultation with Maoridom
Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
Also to comment on whether trading schemes are effective or just shuffling the deck and that maybe carbon tax is the way to go.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
You would think scientists would be employed not old party hacks.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

One issue is to avoid, the other is adaption. So looking at two issues. Adaption is so complex according to region that response
involves Regional Councils. However, some District Councils are so useless it might require a national response if regions fail. Take
Thames Coromandel District Council, they are still draining coastal wetland reserves for the benefit of surrounding pasture . However

if Government can't monitor the Reserves Act how are they going to respond to blatant detrimental treatment of carbon sinks? How is
the Act going to be different form a fat policy document that doesn't give regulatory roles?




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Advising is all very good but for large emitters and councils there should be mandatory reporting. But then there is the issue of the

quality of those reports.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Refrigerants - New Zealand’s Climate Denial. Small amounts but significant due to potency. Example of legislation nobody paying

attention to. If we are to reduce greenhouse gases why in NZ so poor on refrigerants? The irony of people wringing their hands over
emissions yet nobody seems concerned over the fridge unless it fails to keep the chardy cool. When it fails the fridge is dumped,

gases released. Yes, yes there is a law that says such gases are not to be released into the atmosphere but like so many
environmental laws in NZ, few pay attention. (Even councils regularly flout the Reserves Act.) For if there is no enforcement it is as

good as no law at all. So let’s forget about announcing the edicts that cause no change and actually figure out a way to stop
refrigerants being released from discarded fridges, air conditioning units, dehumidifiers, heat pumps etc At present companies that
run transfer stations allow the dumping of fridges into scrap metal piles. They ask that they are dumped on condition that they have

been ‘de-gassed’. For a start that is not always checked and if it is, and found intact, the dumper is asked to de-gas. The most
common response is the dumper to simply cut the refrigerant line. The company running the transfer station then can claim it is the

responsibility of the dumper and wash their hands but it results in the same thing. It is free to dump a fridge as the metal is recycled.
The dump operator gets free metal out of the deal. Fridges make up a very large proportion of that scrap metal pile. Perhaps the

answer is to require transfer station operators to have a role in recycling the gases and for the polluter to pay. To dump a fridge with
gas will cost something to recover that gas but it should cost significantly more to dump a fridge with the refrigerant line cut. Yes,
there are refrigeration companies that de-gas fridges but it has been known that people pay for such a service only to discover the

company has simply snipped the line out of convenience. All fridges etc end up at the dump so why not concentrate recovery there?
How to get transfer station operators, that to me seem very disinterested in recycling, to carry out recovery? The pit seems cheaper

and more convenient for so much waste. I fear it might have to be a case of forcing operators to have a system in place that can
easily be monitored and audited if they want fridge metal. Will this result in them not accepting items at all and promote fly tipping?
Least then it will be an issue that is open as opposed to what exists in NZ now which is a total denial. I brought a dehumidifier the

other day but nowhere on the machine or in the manual did it list the refrigerant. So obviously the manufacturer doesn’t even think
the gas will be recycled. The store selling me the dehumidifier had no idea. An end of life recovery bounty system financed at the

point of sale would have worked here. But we really don’t care. We say we do, but it’s like buying a plastic dolphin to show how much
you care about the sea. There is a connection in people’s head but not in reality. Fridge dumping really does seem an issue we have

seriously overlooked in the plethora of Climate Change mission statements. I look forward to the day NZ gets real on hazardous
materials (well behind the OECD on that) and actually monitors what we are doing as a country. Choosing to take a bag to the
supermarket is not going to do it. Please consider gases used in rolling out more heat pumps etc. What is the end point?
