Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Jane Alexandra Dawson








Reference no: 11535

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 If there is not a firm target set in legislation, there is a danger that the response will drift along for the next few years before real action
 is taken. A clear target (with clear, and ambitious interim targets) means everyone knows what we are aiming for. The quicker we get

 started, the easier it will be to get to zero.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 The short-lived gases still create problems, so it makes sense to deal with them at the same time as the long-lived ones. We are
 going to be faced with a major shift in the way we do things, and it would be unhelpful to go through that twice over.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 NZ should take responsibility for its own emissions, not outsource the response to other countries. There would be significant costs

 involved in ensuring that international carbon units really were valid and that they remained in place (e.g. carbon sink forests stayed in
 perpetuity).



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No

 Notes
 Unless there is a strong commitment made (preferably supported by all parties in Parliament) that is binding, there is a danger that
 the target will be watered down when the necessary changes start to be noticed. NZ has a responsibility, along with everyone else in

 the world, to deal with our mess. That should not be able to be swept under the carpet for reasons of political expediency.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Interim budgets is an essential spur to activity. They should be challenging right from the first 5 year period, so people (i.e. the

 ordinary population, who are the ones who need to change habits) and businesses (who can enable people to change) take the
 challenge seriously.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes
 It would be sensible to have a mechanism for revising budgets based on what has been achieved in the previous budget period, but
 the budgets should only be able to be revised to make them more challenging (not less).
Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

It would be too hard to define a 'major event' to avoid the provision for adjusting being misused. And if there is a major event such as
a catastrophic earthquake, that should be taken as an opportunity to rebuild in a zero-carbon way.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Need a range of short, medium and long term plans. It is probably most important to start with the long term ones (e.g. ensuring that
all housing is built to a high standard of energy efficiency), but there should also be a focus on behaviour-change programmes that

can deliver benefits in the shorter term (e.g. incentives for children to walk to school rather than be driven). The Government needs
to work with all of us! We, as individuals, will be a crucial part of the change, and if we are not persuaded of the urgency of acting, the
change will not happen as fast or consistently as it should. That means (a) politicians setting aside their political ambitions to work

constructively together, (b) making it crystal clear that businesses are part of the solution (and might even benefit from changing),
and (c) investing in comprehensive education programmes that inspire people to do better (encouraging rather than berating them).




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

The Commission will be an independent body of experts, so is better placed to make decisions than either the governing party or the
whole parliament, both of which could (and probably would) be swayed by lobbyists and public opinion (which is likely to object to

changes that put prices up or force them to change their habits). But there should be some review mechanism in place, just in case
the Commission goes rogue.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
The 'desirable' expertise items should probably also be 'essential' ones.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes
Linking the two makes it clear that they are part of the same problem. Showing the cost of adaptation to people helps to highlight the

need to change our carbon footprints. Adaptation measures could be tied in with carbon reductions, so that for example if houses
need to be relocated, there is financial assistance to do so if the house owner rebuilds in a zero-carbon way.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

Placing that power in the Commission would make sense, as it is independent and politically neutral.
