Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Victoria, Victoria Threadwell









Reference no: 643

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes

 We need a target to be reached by 2050 or before, not in the second half of the century. The Climate Change Commission needs to
 advise on the targets within each emission budget to get there, and also how to get there in a way which encourages a growth
 economy and investment in new technologies. The ETS should not be the only tool used to get there. We want genuine changes in

 all sectors to get there.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 New Zero Emissions without a doubt. The agriculture sector needs to be included, as this will hopefully also encourage a change in
 mindset away from business as usual where technology is used to making farming less intensive, with a higher quality product which

 in the long term will have less impact on our environment.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes
 Yes, there is a place for the ETS as part of us meeting our goals, but this should be a secondary option. We should actively reduce
 our emissions, then use the ETS as a supplementary tool. As the ETS does not have a good history, it needs sorting out. It needs to

 be transparent and simple so history does not repeat itself. I also believe the ETS should not be in the first emissions target, but
 should be used to target the GHG emissions which are tricky to reduce after all sectors have made an honest effort of reducing their
 carbon emissions to as low as possible.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 Yes. We should set short term targets between now and 2050 (say 5 - 10 years). If we miss the 10 year target, then then 20 year
 target will need to increase. This should be in no way used to reduce our targets if we are finding it too difficult or as a way to give in
 to some sectors kicking up a fuss.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 I feel that we should have a plan in place to meet our 2050 target from the start, even if it needs adjusting. Without a long term plan
 we are making things more difficult for ourselves. For example the emissions budgets set in 2025 and 2030 (figure 2) to be put in

 place now.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
Notes

Yes. Definitely with the Climate Change Commission's advice though and not to be adjusted by each government for their own
benefit.




Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
I believe the first and second budget (so the emission budgets commencing in 2020 and 2025 in figure 2 should be set in place, and

only the third on wards emission budget be able to be changed. This prevents the govt. making changes to the emissions budgets
to benefit themselves.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes, this appears to be a holistic approach which is what is required. The Climate Change Commission also needs to work as an
integrated team so all of these considerations are looked at together, not independently of one another.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes

Yes, change has to happen now!!! Even 2020 is too far away in my mind for changes to start happening. Some of the 'low hanging
fruit' could be targeted as soon as the bill comes into place.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
The advice of the Climate Change Commission, keep the public consultation lines open. Industry leaders should have to put forward

their ideas for how their sector will reduce its carbon emissions for the Climate Change Commission to take into account when it
advises the govt.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
I believe the Climate Change Commissioning should also hold the govt. accountable to prevent the govt. making decisions for their

own benefit (e.g. winning votes, or keeping certain sectors happy). Obviously our international declaration to the Paris agreement
holds us accountable as well, but we need a body of experts closer to home also keeping the govt. accountable day to day.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
As I have said earlier, this should not be the main way that we reach our targets though. But yes, most definitely, an independent
Climate Change Commission needs to advise the govt.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
Yes, the more holistic the better. If all Kiwis know that someone in the Climate Change Commission is able to speak on behalf of

them, they will likely be more supportive and proactive when it comes to making changes which will effect them personally(or as a
business) to help us reach our targets.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

Most definitely. As we are already having to adapt, this needs to be included in the same Bill so the link between reducing GHG
emissions and the effect that climate change is already having on people and companies stays well connected. If there becomes a

disconnect, this is when people may become disheartened .



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes. The review of the adaption plan will need to be continuous as the effects of climate change are someone unpredictable,
especially the time frame in which aspects of the adaption plan will need to come into effect.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
Notes

A targeted adaption reporting power should be mandatory for all companies over a certain size in New Zealand. Companies should
have to report their risk and adaptation plans publicly as this will create a community of ideas and also inspire other companies on

how they can adapt to climate change.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
On a personal note, I am a Building Scientist (I make buildings more energy efficient as a tool for mitigating climate change) and I have

just had my role made redundant due to the large engineering firm no longer seeing any work in this area. This is really upsetting as
we know NZ's building stock needs serious assistance to become healthier and more energy efficient, and that there needs to be

drastic changed for NZ to reach its emissions targets - yet there is no work in this area in the buildings sector. So, I would love to see
new regulations put in place to make our buildings more energy efficient as a tool for mitigating climate change, as well as healthier.

This will require specialist skills like mine. From my experience this needs to be regulated. We can not rely on the developers or
architects/engineers to make this happen because the majority of people will only do it if they HAVE to. General comments:
Agriculture needs to be targeted, there needs to be mandatory reporting on GHG emissions and targets by each company, as well as

a plan for reaching the targets. Without this, we will not reach our international commitment to the Paris agreement as companies
tend to do the minimum required.
