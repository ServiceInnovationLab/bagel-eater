Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 11505

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 New Zealand needs to set an ambitious target now as we only have one earth to live in. We need to act now to make changes to our
 net carbon emissions and drive a change as soon as possible.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050 (or sooner) is the only way to go. This story of why we are going for this

 target needs to be told in good narratives to everyone in New Zealand.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 This target is our target and should not use emissions reductions from international carbon units. Its time we as New Zealanders
 used our own country to reduce emissions rather than relying on international credit.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 Various crisis such as the Global Financial Crisis (which was good and actually reduced carbon emissions), War (which could increase

 carbon emissions) and disasters caused by climate change or natural should not provide a reason to revise our carbon target. The
 whole point is to have a long term 30 year commitment to where we are going. Its like a saving account or kiwisaver you know where
 you would like to get to so you save accordingly no matter what. We we don't have this attitude we will not reach the target. Its also

 important to lock it in so future government reduce or stop the target in future on the pretext that we have crisis.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Setting the target forward is really important and the only way this will work. All of New Zealand needs to know where they are heading

 and what and why are zero emissions target is for.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The future generations of New Zealand need to be considered in setting plans to meet the budgets. Consultation needs to occur

with the children of New Zealand in a meaningful manner so that their voice is heard even if they can not vote for the government at
the time.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
The Climate Change Commissioner needs the expertise on p45 Our Climate Your Say. However it also needs expertise is working with

and supporting youth leadership and consultation. Its the youth of today who are going to be working in the future on the targets. If
the Climate Change Commissioner does not get working with Youth right it will not happen in the future.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes
We definitely need to be working on adaptation to climate change as we will be facing some major environmental changes in the

future.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
