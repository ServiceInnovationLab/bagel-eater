 Notes



 Clause

 Notes
 Yes, but ONLY to allow even further decrease (ie net negative emissions)



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes



 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

 Notes
 This is going to be a difficult process. We need to understand that shifting our economy in this direction is going to involve (potentially
 heavy) losses for some parties. I think it is important we figure out who those losers are going to be, as they will be the ones that

 require the most support and consultation. I'm particularly thinking of Dairy Farmers. They need to be presented with well considered
transition plans to either a) sustainable Dairy or (better yet) well-subsidized transition systems to other kinds of farming. This would

obviously involve huge investment and knowledge support. I do not for a second regard this is as simple. It won't be. But it's
necessary. At the same time, a well-publicized campaign for NZers to eat meat only once or twice a week. Again, this is massively

contentious, I imagine, but I think one of the stakeholders for this kind of change are the consumers of domestic goods with large
carbon footprints.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

I think 'communication' is a very important aspect here -- this process is going to HURT some people financially, and they will have
large media clout. The commission needs to be driving the message that this is an investment in out future. They need to be as
savvy and clear as the forces that oppose them. Essentially, you need a powerful eco-marketing voice, able to make the opposition

(those worried about the short term economic affects) look negligent or foolish -- because that's what they will be trying to do to the
commission.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
There need to be clear powers given to this body -- and a clear map towards progress.
