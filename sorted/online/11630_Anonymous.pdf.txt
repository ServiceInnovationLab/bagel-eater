Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 11630

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived

 gases
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes
 Trees are definitely not the answer. Pasture produces photosynthesis which turns CO2 into O2. There is more pasture and it grows

 more quickly than trees. Trees ruin soil and take 30years to grow. There will be more unemployed people living in NZ, fewer jobs,
 higher taxes and NZ will have to import more food instead of sustaining ourselves and exporting more. We will be at the mercy of our
 competitors.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Concrete evidence that this is actually happening. Use other plants that help NZs economy become stronger throughout, not just

 long term but now. Trees don't do this. Government, stop screwing over your own people. Agriculture brings in the money by
 exporting goods and services, provides work for most NZers directly and indirectly. Why are you trying to hinder/stop NZ Agricultural

 people from producing money for their country with the awesome skills that they have?



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes

 Under the Commissioners direction.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes
 Only if you have Commissioners who are realistic and tell the Government what to put into the second emissions budget (i.e. abolish

 it). Can we really trust the Commissioners, as the Government will be the people choosing who the Commissioners will be. Unfair!!
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
No

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Trees are definitely not the answer. Pasture produces photosynthesis which turns CO2 into O2. There is more pasture and it grows
more quickly than trees. Trees ruin soil and take 30years to grow. There will be more unemployed people living in NZ, fewer jobs,

higher taxes and NZ will have to import more food instead of sustaining ourselves and exporting more. We will be at the mercy of our
competitors.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
If you need Commissioners, they must actually have expertise in this area. Not made up to suit people in the Government putting

bums on seats and paying them a ridiculous wage for doing nothing. Is this the best use of New Zealanders money? Where else are
you going to get the money from?



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Allowing Governments to attack Agricultural sectors will seriously affect everybody in NZ in a very negative way (i.e. most people will

be unemployed, there won't be new jobs to go into, higher taxes, less income, everything will be more expensive to buy as NZ will
need to buy food in, instead of being a quality exporter that brings in money for our country), especially for something that is purely

based on assumptions. Are we really going to plant trees over 10% of quality, versatile farmland that produces renewable pasture at
least 4 times per year and through photosynthesis turns carbon dioxide into oxygen a lot quicker and more often than trees. Trees
takes 30 years to grow, don't need a lot of care, strips the nutrients from the soil and it would take a good 5 years to rejuvenate the

soil after the trees have been felled and stumps have been removed etc. The billion dollars worth seems to be only for planting trees
and paying bums on seats with fancy job titles, not what is needed to help our country to produce enough food for our people (all

NZers) and be exported to other countries, which brings in money for our country to help us live better lives. Our Government is
wasting our time, money and messing with our livelihoods at our expense. Fellow NZers do you really think that our Government

members are going to put their hands in their own pockets to put a large percentage of their paycheques into these assumptions?
Why should we?
