Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Steve, Stephen Maurice Lincoln








Reference no: 11681

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 Climate change is occurring now with an alarming increase in extreme weather events. 2050 may be too late as by then there will be
 much more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. We need a firm goal now and there is enough time to adapt.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 For reasons already stated: Climate change is occurring now with an alarming increase in extreme weather events. 2050 may be too

 late as by then there will be much more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. We need a firm goal now and there is enough time to
 adapt. Methane is ~20-25 times more destructive in trapping radiation than CO2. It still has a long life time ito decades. We must

 consider or we will distort the response.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 By being able to offset our emissions will reduce our response, letting us off the hook so to speak. Our emissions are our
 responsibility.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No

 Notes
 We near focus on a clear goal. It is a benchmark we can access our performance against. Having a moving target will diminish our
 response.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Could set targets for all 6 period of 5 years now.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 Need a fixed target so that we can monitor our progress and compare p[programs in other countries.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
Indeed we need timeframes if we are to meet 0 net emissions by 2050




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
Different focus. Very important but a separate program.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
But as a separate focus.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Notes
What about getting organisations to chart their progress to achieving 0 net emissions?




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Taxing carbon and other greenhouse gases will provide a mechanism for providing incentives to industry and individuals to move to
the lower carbon economy. Why do we not check vehicle emissions in WOF tsting? EVs market penetration will increase: what is the

government / private sector proposing to increase clean energy capacity to balance this increasing demand? Ireland weighs the
waste of individual households and charges them accordingly, why not New Zealand? Thank you for the opportunity: remember

necessity is the mother of invention and all we need is the will. We will have to manage those affected by job losses by providing
training in new skills and by offering alternative job opportunities.
