Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Please make this law strong enough so that subsequent governments cannot weaken it - we really need to stick to this for future

generations, if not aim to do even better. The law must be written in a way that it will be followed by every government that is in from
now to 2050. Also there must be stringent goals set to gradually move towards the 2050 target and robust testing and evaluation

methods to track our progress. Thank you for putting this through, it is a great moment for Aotearoa.
