 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes
 This option provides most clarity and certainty to allow strategic planning for response by organisations, even if the target is made

 somewhat aspirational and may subsequently need to be modified.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes
 A long term commitment to zero carbon must be made. The other options are too uncertain, impossible to quantify and enforce, and

 simply delay the inevitable. Allowing continued emissions of short-lived gases may obscure and eliminate the incentive to find
 unforeseen and relatively simple to implement measures to reduce these emissions. This would particularly disincentivise the cross
 sector and holistic approaches essential to achieving a fully carbon neutral economy (eg introduction of low carbon fertiliser

 production and other decarbonisation developments in agriculture).



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 I select domestic emissions as my strong preference. Substantially greater restrictions should be placed on the use of overseas units
 than just environmental safeguards. They should be used as a last resort, maybe with an extra cost discentive (levy?). Using overseas
 credits to prop up our own efforts Is very much a case of "robbing Peter to pay Paul", and again delays the inevitable. It could also end

 up costing more in the long run due to our inability to meet abatement targets as global carbon costs skyrocket in later years.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 The more certainty the better, but realistically by setting specific targets there must be a mechanism for adjusting the targets from
 time to time, both the total and between sectors. The bill might incorporate intermediate targets for 2030 and 2040 and define a

 mechanism to review these, and allocation between sectors could be addressed as proposed in the discussion document eg in 5
 year overlapping tranches or similar.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 Seems a very good plan in principle.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
Notes

Depending on progress, it is essential that budgets can be relatively easily adjusted ( up or down) as necessary to keep on track.



Clause

7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

A priority is to educate the public in simple terms as to the reasons behind the need for this climate change response (and how the
ETS is addressing this). Foremost is to connect the science with everyday actions. Most individuals and business owners still do not

understand the implications or believe the connection between the conseqences of global warming and their everyday actions.
Secondly work needs to be done to understand cross sector linkages and improve the outcome for sector interaction and

cooperation. Research funding is needed.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes
More timely decisions and less chance of political interference upsetting or watering down the climate change commitment.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
The list is ok, but it seems to me that access to expertise in understanding the technical capacity and options for mitigation in the
three key sectors of transport, stationary energy, agriculture and forestry is also essential.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
Keep it simple and focused. Adaption introduces a whole new batch of complexities and uncertainties which should be dealt with
elsewhere.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Notes
There is a need to avoid additional onerous reporting and audit/compliance costs on organisations. Maybe some framework similar to

upgrading earthquake building requirements could be introduced. Mandatory annual reports for example would in most cases be too
onerous unless it can be included as a component of other required reporting.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
No

Notes
Surely progress in adaptation could where appropriate be included in existing organisational reporting pathways and processes.




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

1. The discussion document continually cites impact on economic growth as the main criterion for the cost of mitigation measures. It
is time that this language was changed. Growth is not necessarily an indicator of benefit, and is finite, ie unsustainable. It is time that

public wellbeing and fulfilment are incorporated as a factor in overall cost/ benefit analysis of climate change response. 2. Agricultural
emissions must be brought in immediately. Agriculture cannot be exempted any longer as it is becoming a massive subsidy which will

increasingly be paid for by other industries and the general public. 3. Terminology- As a final comment, I think the use of "carbon" as a
heading in Table 1 to describe the net zero carbon dioxide target option is confusing and misleading, since methane is also a carbon
containing gas. Stick with the full name of the gas in the table headings and all references to this option, ie "Carbon Dioxide".
