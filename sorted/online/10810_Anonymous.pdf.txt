Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 10810

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Any legislation or policy must be flexible and responsive to change.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes
 Flexibility is key to success - as the environment changes (i.e. gets worse) over time or technology advances, the budgets may need
 to be much lower (or higher) than what they're originally set to.




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
Yes

Notes
Should also consider the broader social and environmental impacts on health; and consider the younger generations' voices and

opinions.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Communicating the process to the public - being transparent about what is going on and engaging youth on the journey could
strengthen the validity of the plans to the people benefiting from them. Using a responsive online tool (or even a website) to keep

the national community up-to-date could be a powerful opportunity to engage wider audiences in central government. I think it is also
imperative and crucial that central government works with local governments (particularly regional councils) on setting plans - after all,

they will most likely be the ones using the plans to guide their policies and plans on climate change, consenting and other
environmental issues.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

I think it is also important to have expertise from the health sector and from the primary industries sector, specifically agriculture or
aquaculture. Representation from civil defence and emergency management might also be relevant, in terms of understanding scope

and response to climate change weather events and how this ought to be best factored into the plans.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
Very glad this is FINALLY happening. I hope that the Climate Change Commission can actually be given the powers to make positive

and sustainable change. Given that the Commerce Commission has decision-making powers, then I wholeheartedly think the Climate
Change Commission should too - for far too long commerce and economy has been given preference over the environment. In order

for this Bill to have a sustainable impact, at least give them equal representation and powers. Climate change is past the point of
being political fodder, it is happening regardless of who is in power. On the consultation document: for future reports, please a font

other than Calibri. Something like Helvetica Neue or even Arial would be better from a style point of view. Calibri is just the standard
Word document template font that is so lazy and understyled, a piece of my soul dies whenever Calibri is used by government
agencies. Please sharpen up.
