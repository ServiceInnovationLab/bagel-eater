Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Scott Matthew Willis








Reference no: 11725

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 We need a solid and aspirational target now, and do all in our power to achieve it. Lock it in legislation please.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived

 gases
 Notes
 I support Jeanette Fitzsimmons call for a two basket approach but only if methane is first cut deeply and fast supported by science.

 We need urgent reduction in all greenhouse gases and the Climate Commission should have the authority here to direct a rational
 approach to rapid decarbonisation.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 We must invest all we can in domestic emissions reduction. This will be a stimulus to green growth, even if other parts of our

 economy necessarily shrink (we can't have economic growth in a bounded system without disaster).



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 I say "Yes" but it should only be revised in light of new climate science and only made more stringent. It should never be revised as a
 result of political pressure including economic concern.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Yes, 5 year budgets is a very good and rational way to proceed. It allows for planning and certainty and sets a very clear pathway to

 help a stable transition to Zero Carbon.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes
 Yes, but only when the subsequent budget is set and only in response to climate science.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes, the second emissions budget should be able to be changed, BUT only to be made tighter, and only in response to climate
science in order to reduce risk. It should not be changed on political whim. We are talking about species survival and we can't afford

to be timid.



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
We need to recognise that climate change cannot fit into a neat box to be sorted. It is already transforming society and our global

civilisation. So we must expect greater uncertainty. I support the considerations but I would like to add that I view climate action as the
most critical area to focus on, and I do not want a continuation of the myth of economic growth.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes

Of course. Otherwise it is just rhetoric. We need plans and we need immediate action. We don't have time to waste anymore.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Effective climate action will require a whole of society approach. Government should work with established NGO's like the Blueskin
Resilient Communities Trust, Wise Response, Generation Zero, Forest and Bird, and groups like Our Climate Declaration to build

greater and richer social licence. Government should also work with place-based groups engaged in climate action like the Blueskin
Resilient Communities Trust and member organisations of the Community Energy Network. You can gain much from the know-how

and flax-roots experience of the community and NGO sectors.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

I would like an independent CCC that makes decisions itself, in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS. We need a very
strong commitment to the long-term goal of Zero Net Carbon and a non-political body can work to the science and provide certainty
and authority. Government can then do its job at managing the complexity within known limits.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes
We need the ETS to be an effective tool. This may help achieve that, but if not, we should certainly consider a Carbon Tax.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Yes, but I also think that you need to move away from the standard Wellington approach and bring a wider and more diverse group of

people together. The CCC will need to understand the community sector and youth as well, and cannot focus on economic growth in
a finite world. We have to get over this idea of an extractive economy and start to build a regenerative economic system. I would like

to see the CCC supported by specific reference groups as well, to widen input and increase know-how as well as increase social
reach.
Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes, we have entered the Long Emergency, climate change is happening, we are causing it and we must adapt even as we work to

reduce its impacts. I want to see government practice adaptive governance and embrace risk and experimentation as we go forward,
to try out alternatives. I want to see government investing in community action to build community capacity for greater informed

action and gain strength from the flax-roots. I want to see government providing good stewardship and behaving responsibly,
working to support collaboration.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

We need some short term gains as well. Please consider supporting a Board of Inquiry into a National Environmental Standard for
small scale wind as recommended in the 2011 Board of Inquiry into the NPS-REG and in the 2016 review of the NPS-REG. This will
help deliver the challenging task of 100% REG by 2035 - a job we needed to start yesterday!
