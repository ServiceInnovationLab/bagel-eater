Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Daniela Bagozzi








Reference no: 4396

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 I support the target of reducing our own emissions to zero, and not using carbon credits.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 Our domestic economy needs to change, and we need to take the long term view. Government needs to stop directly or indirectly
 subsidizing any activity that increases our emissions, as well as introducing measures to curb emissions (including the necessary
 incentives). In addition, NZ should assist and encourage other Countries to reduce their emissions.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Yes, the targets should be revised if circumstances change, but NOT because of 'economic' circumstances. Any proposal for change

 should have approval from the Climate Commission and should be approved by Parliament.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 I am saying No because it's important for all sectors of the economy to have certainty. Each new Government may introduce different
 policies for achieving those targets.




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Only under exceptional circumstances, e.g. major natural disasters (if necessary).
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes
It's important to have timely implementation of the Act: Policy plans should be put in place max. 6 months after an emission budget

has been decided.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Policy plans should be: comprehensive, timely, fair (meaning ensuring that vulnerable communities are supported, including workers
in industries that will suffer job losses, and that clear signals are given early in the process to enable businesses and communities to

plan for the impact of planned policies, as well as for opportunities arising from such policies). Plans must also be cost-effective,
environmentally sustainable (i.e.: take into account the health of the environment overall, not only of emissions) and must be

respectful of Te Tiriti o Waitangi.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
I would suggest the addition of someone with expertise in Public Health.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
And it's important that the Climate Change Commission advise on measures to be taken to assist with adaptation.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

I would like to see this Government encourage the governments of other Countries with which NZ has trading relationships, to which
NZ provides any form of aid or with which NZ cooperates on other matters, to enact and implement a similar Zero Carbon Act.
