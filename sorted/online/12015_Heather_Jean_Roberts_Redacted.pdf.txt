Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Reference no: 12015

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes
 I would like the commission to work out what a target means so that the legislated target is meaningful. I would like the target to be

 aimed at getting to net zero by 2040, to increase the likelihood of getting there by 2050 even if unexpected things come up.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 If it is not possible to set 'net zero' then priority should be given to long-lived gases, but my ideal would be fully net zero.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes
 In general I believe in a globalised system rather than NZ acting as if we are a sealed-off entity. However, there are very few countries

 in the world that already have net zero emissions. If we used international units, that involves putting an extra burden on the
 countries in which they are generated, as they have to offset both their own emissions and ours. I do not wish to put that burden
 onto countries much poorer than our own. I would be happy with a scheme that enabled us to by international units from countries

 with similar (or higher) wealth to our own, but I would like to restrict international units from poorer countries to those from countries
 that do not have emissions of their own to offset. This, however, feels too logistically complicated, hence why I have chosen domestic
 emission reductions only.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 If we proceed faster than expected, future targets can be adjusted so that we reach net zero sooner. If there is a crisis of some kind
 that means we need to stop reducing our emissions for some time, future targets can be adjusted such that we still reach the goal
 by 2050. This should only be allowed if the crisis is severe and if the revised targets remain realistic.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 That's great as it allows those affected to make plans in a predictable environment.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes
Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Only under very exceptional circumstances. To establish this, we'd need a high bar - perhaps 2/3 of the House have to agree the
circumstances are exceptional, or perhaps both the governing party/parties and the largest party in opposition - something like that.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
I think it is a good list. Social circumstances and the current science are particularly important to me.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Budgets need to be realistic - e.g. achievable with current technologies rather than just with technologies we hope will have

eventuated in 10 years' time. There needs to be plans to help people who will be adversely affected - e.g. increases in Benefit levels
if they make essentials a lot more expensive or money allocated for re-training if the plan will lead to a particular industry becoming
uneconomic. Increased taxation for this is OK, although it may not be necessary as money could be saved along the way as well, and

new industries will bring in new tax.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

But there should be consequences to not meeting targets. I don't know how to achieve this (as it would be the government itself
needing to be sanctioned and we don't have national bodies higher than the government), but if feels important. I don't know if there

is a way the Climate Change Commission could do this, but if they could that would be good. They must at least make sure the public
knows if targets aren't being met.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes
I would like the commission to make this decision, but there should be a mechanism for the government to over-ride it. I don't like the

idea of an unelected body constraining the elected government.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
I think the list of essential expertise is good. I would like it also to be required that someone is there who knows about current and

near-term technology, so that they can advise on what is currently realistic.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
I wouldn't mind if it did, but it doesn't feel essential.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
