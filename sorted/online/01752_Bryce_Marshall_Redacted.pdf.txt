Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Bryce Marshall





Reference no: 1752

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes
 I strongly disagree that there is any urgent need to set an emissions reduction target, and particularly not for CO2.




 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 I strongly disagree that there is any urgent need to set an emissions reduction target, and particularly not for CO2.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Notes
 I strongly disagree that there is any urgent need to set an emissions reduction target, and particularly not for CO2.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 The Bill should be scrapped



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 I strongly disagree that there is any urgent need to set an emissions reduction target, and particularly not for CO2.




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes

 The mere suggestion that New Zealanders in the future, or indeed future generations of New Zealanders, should NOT be able to
 change the terms of such an (negatively) economically impactful piece of proposed legislation is totalitarian in the extreme. That
 having been said, the thought of an ideologically driven government possibly acting at the behest of an international conglomerate

 hysterically imposing ever increasing "climate" tariffs and penalties is horrific.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 The mere suggestion that New Zealanders in the future, or indeed future generations of New Zealanders, should NOT be able to

 change the terms of such an (negatively) economically impactful piece of proposed legislation is totalitarian in the extreme. That
 having been said, the thought of an ideologically driven government possibly acting at the behest of an international conglomerate
 hysterically imposing ever increasing "climate" tariffs and penalties is horrific.



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Largely, yes, however I have no confidence that the government will be objective in its considerations given its ideological drivers.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Notes

A failure to plan, as they say, is a plan to fail, however this bill is a failure from the outset, because it proposes an ideologically-driven
and economically disastrous solution to a non-existent problem, and will ultimately result in a reduced quality of life for most New

Zealanders.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The Government needs to develop some economic common sense. The government should consider the opinions of the many
thousands of scientists (including especially those whose fields are particularly relevant to so-called climate science) who have a

more realistic and less ideologically-driven view of the role of CO2 (and particularly mankind's tiny contribution of it) in driving climate
change.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No
Notes

Unfortunately, I do not trust either the proposed Commission (which is likely to be stacked with ideologically driven members) or this
government (which is strongly ideologically driven to the detriment of common sense) to make objectively evidence-based decisions

on climate policy.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Notes

Neither. I hope that a future government will disband it.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

I fail to see the need for Maori-specific consultation, or specific Treaty considerations.The most significant impact of any such
proposed policy is likely to be economic, and this will drive other consequences.Rest assured, the Oceans will neither fall nor rise as a

consequence of the government's proposed meddling.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
The climate models are a failure. Green energy remains a pipe dream (every current implementation either has a high ongoing

functional dependency upon fossil fuels, or is unreliable and incapable of serving 21st century energy requirements.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

From page 47 of Our Climate Your Say "climate will continue to change over the coming decades. This is because some climate
change is already locked in from historic emissions, and we will need to adapt to this" No. Climate change is not "locked in from
historic emissions". This is because the climate has always, and will always continue to, change. Sea levels, global temperature, and

CO2 have throughout the course of geological history fluctuated to extremes either side of the climate's current state. These
variations happened long before man's industrial activity. The Paris accord is a costly waste of paper which punishes the world's

lowest CO2 emitters and rewards it's worst polluters. It does nothing to reduce net CO2 emissions, and is nothing more than a global
socialist wealth redistribution initiative in drag.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
No

Notes
That's rather vague, isn't it? What do we mean by that? And intrusive and costly bureaucracy (goes without saying, I guess) which
monitors private businesses to punish them for not being Green enough? Or do we mean setting up a trough for Iwi and other

special interest groups to claim compensation because it is warmer/colder this year than it was last?



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Scrap it.
