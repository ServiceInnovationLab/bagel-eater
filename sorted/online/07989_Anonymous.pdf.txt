Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill







Reference no: 7989

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 Clarity is important to allow the public, industry and local authorities to prepare for the transition, to positively influence the planning of

 major infrastructure and to secure investment for new technologies and industries.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 However, there needs to be a safeguard to avoid change driven by lobbyists rather than science based findings supporting the best

 outcome for us and future generations.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes

 However such a change should only be informed by science based evidence not lobbyists with alternative motives. The threshold for
 change should require a better outcome for NZ and the world.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No
 Notes



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
The considerations should be based on a longer-term view to the benefit of all of New Zealand, not a short-term impact on a

particular group.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Decisions should be based on the long-term impacts not short term costs, should provide a clear signal to industry to encourage
and able investment into the transition, and should consider climate thresholds (dangerous limits) and thresholds for future

commitments (such as the onset of irreversible ice sheet loss and thus sea level rise but many such thresholds exist).



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
Yes, but I could see also the Commission to have decision making rights to be highly effective and perhaps superior to the

suggested model.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes
I think this is particularly important because it also highlights the cost of non-action, the cost benefits of mitigation and critical

thresholds of dangerous changes for communities, industry and infrastructure across NZ.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
It is excellent and useful to have this discussion. Now, we need to move fast to allow for a viable mitigation pathway, to avoid the most
severe of climate change consequences, to gain from the benefits of our transition to a carbon neutral world and to position New

Zealand as a leader, role model and good citizen of the world.
