Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Jacqueline Anne Tyrrell









Reference no: 1276

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes
 It's urgent - but it's also vital to make the most of the opportunity for a cross-party agreement.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases
 Notes




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 Not revised to make it weaker, but it should be possible to strengthen targets if multiple adverse weather events (for example)
 increase the political will for change.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 Again, they should not be able to be changed to make them weaker, but they should be able to be strengthened.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
 New Zealanders are so influenced by the USA these days that any adjustments made by politicians are sure to weaken the whole
 thing.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The main areas of expertise suggested on P45 for the Climate Change Commission seem to me to cover the important issues that

the Government needs to consider.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
It also needs to have powers to hold the Government accountable for the decisions it makes in relation to the ETS.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
The "desirable" ones worry me. NZ is not doing very well at nurturing innovation - really innovative ideas coming out of our universities

are unlikely to get support. And including "business expertise" stands a good chance of just looking after the interests of the rich and
powerful, and further increasing the gap between rich and poor.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
There's a desperate need for an overall strategy. Houses are still being built on totally questionable land. And politicians are not to be
relied on in this area - the RNZ National news this week talked of National Party climate change deniers!!




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
It's time for some transparency. It's not fair if some businesses can behave badly and obscure this.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

I have spent time with people working in the alternative energy industry in Britain, and have been amazed at the scale of change in
Britain. NZ has had its head in the sand for too long. The work done so far on this act seems to me to be heading in the right

direction.
