Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 A clear goal and timeframe to achieve the same will provide the most certainty. The third option presents further uncertainty



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 It is unclear, presumably intentionally so, what "Stabilised Short Lived Gases" means. I assume it means stabilised at current levels. On
 that basis, given those methane levels are not that far off 50% of NZ's total emissions profile, the second option wouldn't appear to
 achieve a lot more than our existing 2050 NDC of a 50% reduction. While that reduction is commendable relative to certain other

 nations, I don't think it is sufficient, and doesn't reflect what I believe NZ is able to achieve. Your forecasting does not show a material
 difference between options 2 and 3 therefore why not adopt the more onerous target which will de-risk costs associated with the

 transition earlier than would otherwise be the case? Further, many peer reviewed papers suggest the earlier net zero is achieved the
 better in order to avoid exhausting the remaining carbon budget. Finally, I don't think it's equitable that any one sector receives a
 significant indirect subsidy at the expense of other sectors over such a long period of time, with one result being that it places too

 much pressure on other sectors to reduce their emissions. The indirect subsidy resulting from the complete exclusion of agriculture
 emissions has distorted land investment decisions and in part led to that sector representing such a high proportion of NZ's GDP
 (and hence its current strong negotiation position ). There must be some requirement on producers of methane to reduce their

 levels over the next 20 years, and this must be an absolute level, not just relating to emissions intensity, which is a current failing of
 the ETS settings. I think a fourth option should also be considered which provides net zero emissions of long lived gases and a

 reduced level of methane by 2050, leaving NZ less to achieve at likely a lower cost from 2050 onwards.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes
 As a starting point, NZ should take responsibility for offsetting its own emissions with domestic reductions. There's a theoretical
 economic argument that if we can obtain cheaper offsets from foreign low cost producers (assuming they are legitimate), then we

 should use those to reduce the overall cost of the transition. I will be very surprised if the world is anything but short carbon credits at
 the relevant dates, and even if they are available, demand vs supply would suggest a high price. Therefore, NZ should prepare to

 meet all emission reductions domestically, but have a limited ability to purchase offshore in the unlikely case that cheap offshore
 legitimate offsets are available e.g. say up to 10% of total commitments. A cost benefit analysis prior to purchasing offshore
 reductions would need to take into account broader considerations than just direct costs, including matters such as increased

 biodiversity and other revenue streams from additional NZ forestry (tourism, honey, heritage), increased employment, improved
 soil/erosion/water etc



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Yes, up and down, but only as required to the extent our obligations under the Paris Agreement change. We are setting a target 20+

 years into the future with flexibility in the interim budgets to ensure the end goal remains achievable. Opening up the ability to change
 the target outside of alignment to changes under the Paris Agreement again creates uncertainty, and may see the government of the
 day do just that as an easy, short term option, as occurred immediately post the GFC in 2008/09



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

Notes
Either option under 'yes'. I don't fully understand the implications resulting from the difference between the two options, but I think a

level of flexibility is needed as all forecasting 15 years out will be wrong, it's a matter of how wrong. The backstop is that the 2050
target cannot be changed (as proposed above), so any reduction in emissions effort will need to be recovered in subsequent

periods. One could also consider capping the extent to which any 3rd period budget can be varied, say up to [20]% in total, in order
to avoid making future budgets, and the 2050 target, too onerous



Clause

7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Refer above regarding inaccuracy of forecasting. Same points immediately above apply to this question albeit tighter parameters
given the shorter time period




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
public / private sector consultation, Climate Commission advice, politicians following the expert consensus and advice., and not
making their own decisions contrary to that advice




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

If the government chooses not to follow the advice it needs to clearly and publically justify why the advice wasn't followed - and it
needs to be justified




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes
Or otherwise in a related piece of legislation




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

Disclosure of climate change risks, exposure and opportunities is essential to all stakeholders and the reporting entity itself and is
essential to enabling accurate decisions around capital allocation
