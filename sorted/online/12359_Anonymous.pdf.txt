 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 See notes to Q2.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 There is a good case for the legislation to have as its centrepiece a long-term emissions reduction target, and that this target should
 be in the legislation from the date of its enactment. The main purpose of a legislated target is to provide certainty. If the Climate

 Change Commission is to advise on the target at a later stage, that certainty is potentially at risk. There are, however, several aspects
 to the target which could benefit from further expert advice from the CCC, namely: • how a target could distinguish between long-
 lived gases and short-lived gases; and • the acceptable level of gross emissions reductions rather than net emissions reductions.

 Arguably, either of these questions could form a separate target. It is important, however, that the legislation is supported by political
 consensus. If the long-term target is at risk of immediate repeal from a successive government, it fails in its central purpose to

 provide certainty. I submit that: • At a minimum, the Zero Carbon Bill should commit New Zealand to achieving net zero long-lived
 gases by 2050; • The CCC should separately advise on the reductions needed to short-lived gases to a level consistent with keeping
 increase in global temperature below the 1.5°C under the Paris Agreement; and • The CCC should separately advise on the

 acceptable level of gross and net emissions. Following advice from the CCC regarding the second and third points, the Zero Carbon
 Act should be updated to reflect the additional long-term targets relating to short-lived gases and



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 New Zealand should meet its targets only through the reduction of domestic emissions. It should not rely on the overseas emissions
 reductions for the following reasons: • as experience has shown, the integrity of international emissions are inherently unreliable; •

 the Zero Carbon Act should prompt structural changes within New Zealand’s government, economy and society as quickly as
 possible – there must be impetus to move away from ‘business as usual’.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 The only circumstances in which the 2050 target should be revised is if scientific knowledge or international agreements required

 reductions at a greater rate. The Zero Carbon Bill should contain no provision that addresses the prospect that the long-term target
 can be amended.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 Yes. The process for setting a budget should be: • the Climate Change Commission(CCC) first advises on the acceptable levels of
 the budget; • the Government must then propose the budget to Parliament, and give written reasons for any departure from the
 CCC’s advice; and • Parliament must accept the budget by affirmative resolution.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
Position

No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
Notes




Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Only in exceptional and unforeseen circumstances, such as an extreme natural disaster. Even then, the budget should be subject to

prior advice from the CCC and approval by Parliament in the usual way.



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes. It is important, however, that these are matters which should only inform the CCC’s advice on budgets. There should be a
preliminary provision in the Bill which sets out the broader principles on which the legislation rests. See Part 1 of Generation Zero’s
submission for what those principles should be.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable,
and honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi. For a detailed explanation of these principles, see Generation Zero’s submission Part I: Zero Carbon
Act framework.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Yes. The CCC should not be a decision-making body. It is unconstitutional to give decision-making functions to an unelected and

unaccountable body. Being a decision-maker could also expose the CCC to criticism and legal challenges which could undermine its
effectiveness and discharge of other responsibilities. The CCC should NOT have responsibility for developing a climate risk

assessment as proposed in the Discussion Document for the reasons set out on page 40 of Generation Zero’s submission.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

Advisory only. See my answer to Q11.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Yes, but the CCC should NOT have responsibility for developing a climate risk assessment as proposed in the Discussion Document

for the reasons set out on page 40 of Generation Zero’s submission.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes

Q1 and Q 2. The long-term target.


There is a good case for the legislation to have as its centrepiece a long-term emissions
reduction target, and that this target should be in the legislation from the date of its
enactment. The main purpose of a legislated target is to provide certainty. If the Climate
Change Commission is to advise on the target at a later stage, that certainty is potentially at
risk.


There are, however, several aspects to the target which could benefit from further expert
advice from the CCC, namely:

       how a target could distinguish between long-lived gases and short-lived gases; and
       the acceptable level of gross emissions reductions rather than net emissions
        reductions.

Arguably, either of these questions could form a separate target.


It is important, however, that the legislation is supported by political consensus. If the long-
term target is at risk of immediate repeal from a successive government, it fails in its central
purpose to provide certainty.

I submit that:

       At a minimum, the Zero Carbon Bill should commit New Zealand to achieving net
        zero long-lived gases by 2050;

       The CCC should separately advise on the reductions needed to short-lived gases to a
        level consistent with keeping increase in global temperature below the 1.5 ° under
        the Paris Agreement; and
       The CCC should separately advise on the acceptable level of gross and net emissions.

Following advice from the CCC regarding the second and third points, the Zero Carbon Act

should be updated to reflect the additional long-term targets relating to short-lived gases
and gross vs net emissions.



Q3. How should NZ meet its targets?

New Zealand should meet its targets only through the reduction of domestic emissions. It
should not rely on the overseas emissions reductions for the following reasons:

       as experience has shown, the integrity of international emissions are inherently

        unreliable;
       the Zero Carbon Act should prompt structural changes within New Zealand’s

        move away from ‘business as usual’.
Q4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances
change?

The only circumstances in which the 2050 target should be revised is if scientific knowledge
or international agreements required reductions at a greater rate. The Zero Carbon Bill
should contain no provision that addresses the prospect that the long-term target can be

amended.

No.




Q7. Should the government be able to alter to review and adjust the second emissions
budget within a specific range under exceptional circumstances?

Only in exceptional and unforeseen circumstances, such as an extreme natural disaster.
Even then, the budget should be subject to prior advice from the CCC and approval by
Parliament in the usual way.

making functions to an unelected and unaccountable body. Being a decision-maker could

also expose the CCC to criticism and legal challenges which could undermine its
