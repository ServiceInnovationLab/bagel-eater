Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Rebecca




Reference no: 1492

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 Climate change is seriously affecting our country and the world, specifically as we are an island nation and have many island
 neighbours. We should set a 2050 in the legislation so that the government can be held accountable to the courts to reach that

 target



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes
 Ideally, we should set a Net Zero Emmissions target, but I think that is unrealistic given our reliance on the dairy industry. Instead, we
 should adapt - seek to revitalise and diversity our economy using innovation, alongside reducing reliance on the dairy industry, while

 mitigating the impact of the diary industry by stablising short-lived gases



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 We should not rely on emissions reductions from overseas - it is important in this area to be independent



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 The Target should be certain and stable - as a central tenet of the rule of law. We should be ambitious and realistic and not allow for
 minimising our committments if we are not close to meeting them.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 It is good that the budget period (5 years) does not directly overlap with the electoral terms. This requires more interparty
 cooperation in the House when budgets are set, as any party could become accountable for that budget when they come into office
 in a later electoral term. This would insulate the policy-making process from short term political pressures




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
Notes

Naturally, but this could be done in a state of emergency, rather than giving the Govt specific ability to review the second budget
within the Zero Carbon Act.




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
The Climate Change Commission's recommending power should mirror that of the Law Commission's. It should have advisory power,

with mechanisms to hold Govt to account, but should not be able to make delegated-legislation as it is neither part of government
nor an elected official body. The factors that the Commission should consider are good ones, including Treaty obligations.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

The Govt should table the Commission's recommendations and issue a public report on it, perhaps comparable to tabling of UN
Human Rights reports and responses.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
1. Maori interests and the Treaty of Waitangi 2. Dairy industry 3. Meeting our Paris obligations 4. What NZ will do in response to
potential climate refugees coming from the Pacific




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes
Adaptation and Mitigation should go hand in hand Resilience of our communities is already at issue, with major floods, tornadoes etc,

and with biosecurity threats challenging our agricultural security and conservation efforts.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes

Notes
Share information on their exposure to climate change risks + share information on how they will meet their carbon budgets




Clause
