Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 8272

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 This is important. If we only reduce carbon dioxide we are going to lose the battle. All greenhouse gases contribute to climate
 change. We need to target net zero emissions for all greenhouse gases.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 The whole planet needs to achieve net zero emissions. That includes New Zealand. We need to reach net zero emissions in New

 Zealand. We can help other nations, but helping other nations should not be an excuse/reason not to reduce our own emissions.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 I see no foreseeable circumstances where we would want to give up on this target. If aliens invade maybe...



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
 its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

 (NZ ETS)?
 Position
 Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

 Notes
 If the commission is independent, it can make the best decisions for the climate and for NZ, without having to worry about winning
 the next election.
Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

I support the creation of an independent climate change commission with strong powers to ensure New Zealand reaches net zero
emissions by 2050.
