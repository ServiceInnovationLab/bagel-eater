Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Glenville Stiles, Glenville Gordon Stiles








Reference no: 9196

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes
 Emissions from almost every aspect of our everyday living are complex and generally inter-related. It will take a lot of time and effort to

 unravel these and establish a solution that has the least economical impact for the greatest gain. While a time target is important but
 not to the extent that decisions are compromised by time constraints.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived

 gases
 Notes

 Emission from processes that use the reduction of metal oxides to the metals we at least need in the next 50 years all produce
 carbon dioxide. Air transport produces huge quantities of CO2, 1 kg of fuel burnt = 3.15 kg of CO2 at high altitude where it takes time
 to fall to ground or sea level to be converted to carbon and oxygen in plant life to highlight just a couple of major issues.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes

 New forests take time to prepare, plant & grow to the point where significant quantities can be converted, limiting uptake in the initial
 time set periods. I am concerned that trading in carbon credits by financial traders can escalate costs with no real input to the
 environmental issues.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 The interrelated issues will be complex so as they evolve, the time line may need to be adjusted in respect to some specific issue or
 issues to achieve the best outcome. After all what is the use of fixing the environment if we can not live here.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 The financial impact must be established and budgets set in place as the remedial issues evolve.




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes
 To ensure that there is an on-going responsibility toward the objective.
Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

See above. The issues will take time to evolve, there respective impacts, remedial actions and the related costs.



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

While it is good to have a statement (an objective) at the outset, this should be able to be refined and adjusted as the issues are
defined in detail and solutions established so that hasty actions are taken that can have adverse impact elsewhere at a later date. We
are still suffering from legislation that impacted on leaky buildings made from untreated timber to name one example from the

industry I have been involved in.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes
We must be kept informed on the issues and solutions, not knee jerk type proclamations 'from the throne'.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
Consult with the regions to establish all the issues as they apply to that region. One fix will not fit all. Auckland's issues are very

different to Westlands. We have very low CO2 emissions and large biomass uptake while Auckland is exactly the opposite.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
The issues are very complex and inter-related as banning one item, say oil can have a flow on effect to medical issues, lubrication for

transport issues, energy replacement issues for transport, industrial and commercial processing, heating and so on & on & on, to
name just one.
