Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Mark Bicknell, Mark William Bicknell








Reference no: 8989

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived

 gases
 Notes
 Any gases derived from closed carbon cycles, specifically ruminant gas emissions, should be excluded from any target set.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes

 Forestry should not be the only method included for sequestering carbon. All photosynthising plants and other carbon storing
 methods must be recognised.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 This is a qualified yes as there is little information available on how such budgets would be set.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

FIrst and foremost the plans need to be demonstrably fair and equitable, especially in regard to economic effects, to those people
directly affected by such plans. They also need to be scientifically defensible and not simply arrived at by so-called consensus.

Thorough cost/benefit analyses need to be carried out and fully considered in the setting of any plans.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

It is quickly becoming apparent that proposed legislation on New Zealand's carbon emissions is likely leading towards unfair and
inequitable treatment of ruminant biological emissions. It is clear on scientific basis that ruminant carbon emissions occur in a closed

carbon cycle and thus are neutral in their contribution to atmospheric carbon. In order to avoid any unfairness or inequities in
government legislation such emissions must either be excluded or have their entire carbon cycle recognised. Doing so will ensure

fairness and equity and will also prevent important export industries that rely on ruminant animals from being disadvantaged in world
markets.
