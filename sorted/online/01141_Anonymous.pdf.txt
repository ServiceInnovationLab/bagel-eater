Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill











Reference no: 1141

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Carbon Dioxide - Reducing net carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 Emissions trading is just a wealth transfer scam. Either a country can reduce its emissions or it won't.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 one budget of 5 years



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes
 We can't say what economic conditions will be like int 15 years. If the country's economy collapses and we are plunged into

 widespread poverty, we would be crazy to lock ourselves into an emissions budget that could cause people harm.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
No

Notes



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The economy and the wellbeing of the people of NZ must always come before our emissions. Our emissions are a tiny fraction of the
worlds contribution so we should make an effort to lead the world, but we shouldn't disadvantage ourselves so much that the people

of NZ suffer as a consequence.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

The commission should only monitor and report because it cannot be held accountable by the people. Only elected officials can be
held accountable by the people of NZ.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

It should advise the Government to avoid an ETS at all costs. They are wealth transfer scams and have absolutely nothing to do with
improving our environment.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
