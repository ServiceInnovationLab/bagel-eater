Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

David Hodges








Reference no: 1191

Submitter Type:

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 If all countries keep to the commitment made at Paris, this is likely to result in a CO2 level of around 450ppm by 2050. This level of
 greenhouse gases is likely to cause severe disruption to the climate and climatologists such as James Hansen have argued that it
 carries a real risk of triggering major positive feedback loops resulting in irreversible catastrophic climate change and the possible

 extinction of the human species. The world will need to go carbon negative to lower CO2 back to current levels or lower. The sooner
 we do this, the less damage will be caused by extreme weather events and the less we will risk triggering irreversible runaway climate

 change. Therefore it would be preferable for New Zealand and other countries to go carbon negative as soon as possible - before
 2050 if possible.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 New Zealand has the potential to offset most or all of our greenhouse gas emissions by converting to organic farming and managing
 farms to increase carbon sequestration in pasture soils. We can easily meet a net zero emissions target by 2050 without purchasing

 carbon credits overseas. Furthermore, increasing the carbon content of our pasture soils is likely to be highly beneficial to farmers as
 it increases the water holding capacity of the soil. This is likely to increase resilience to flooding and drought and increase productivity
 during dry periods.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes

 The bill should only allow the target to be revised to a stricter target, not a weaker target.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 The government should only be able to change the budget to a stricter budget (lower net emissions)



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
 The government should only be able to change the budget to a stricter budget (lower net emissions)
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

All of the considerations listed are important, however the Commission needs to remember that if the world does not reduce our
emissions quickly enough, we are likely to trigger major positive feedback loops causing catastrophic and potentially irreversible

climate change, with the possible loss of billions of human lives. It is worth suffering some hardship now to avoid suffering much
greater hardship later.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes
Absolutely. The National government demonstrated clearly that failing to plan is planning to fail. One year is more than sufficient time

to produce a plan once a budget has been announced, considering that much or most of the planning can be done in advance of
announcing the budget.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
The government needs to consider the potentially catastrophic consequences of the world failing to take sufficient action soon

enough. We do not know at what temperature and what greenhouse gas concentrations catastrophic irreversible positive feedback
loops will occur. The precautionary principle and common sense dictates that we should therefore take all possible steps to avoid

them - by lowering our net emissions as rapidly as possible.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

If the commission is not to have decision making power, the government must publicly respond to, and provide rationale when it
deviates from, the Commissionâ€™s advice.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes
The Commission should be able to specify a maximum number of units available, with the government free to choose to allocate a
lower number of units. By the previous government's own admission, the ETS has so far been worse than useless as the cost of

units has been too low and far too many units have been allocated for free. The Climate Change Commission should advise the
government whether to keep the ETS or adopt an alternate mechanism, such as a carbon tax, which some economists have argued

would be simpler and more effective.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes

This needs to be addressed but could be addressed in a separate bill.
Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

All local governments, state owned enterprises and crown entities need to plan and prepare for climate change. Such planning
should be publicly available.
