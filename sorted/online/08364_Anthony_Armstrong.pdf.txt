Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Anthony Armstrong








Reference no: 8364

Submitter Type:

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 A strategy that understandings the earth is moving into a cooling period and thus reducing CO2 that grows our food is fool hardy. This

 Zero emmision strategy clearly demonstrated we will find ample “ food supply “ be put at risk.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 None of the above. Fortunately climate change legislation will fail



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 As the implementation of another compliance tax is placed on the farming sector we will find the farming sector will find farming
 unaffordable with obvious outcomes and consequences.

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Follow the tax and understand the overarching strategy. “A globalist aspiration to reduce global population.” This strategy will achieve
its goal and those who implement and support this venture through the tax will unfortunately be the first to realise their mistake.
