Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Rachel Julia Arthur





Reference no: 11757

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 Focusing on carbon dioxide to the exclusion of other greenhouse gases prioritises some industries over others. In addition, lots of
 short-lived gases have very high carbon dioxide equivalent values, so reducing them is a relatively easy way to reduce climate

 change. By 2050 we won't have the luxury of thinking in the long term because already climate change risks producing runaway
 effects (through ice melting, the release of methane from the permafrost, and so on).



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 New Zealand is a country custom-made to be able to reduce it's emissions - a lot of space and natural resources, a relatively small
 and wealthy population, a strong connection with the environment. We should be leading the way, not relying on others to make

 changes we aren't willing or able to. If a worldwide emissions trading scheme develops, I would expect NZ to be a net exporter of
 carbon units.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 No

 Notes



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes
 But with safeguards so that future governments can't just change the targets because they decide it's too hard. Possibly significant
 changes would have to go to a parliamentary vote or receive agreement from a cross-party working group.




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes, but I would also add: - consider that climate change reduction strategies can have positive as well as negative effects on the
economy and society - also consider wider environmental impacts, for example the damage to fisheries and birds from tidal schemes

I especially like this: 'The Commission could also consider the three government objectives for climate change policy: sustainable
economy, global and local leadership and creating a just and inclusive society.'



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The Government needs to work with business (as always) but also and especially local government and community groups.

Sometimes business priorities push out community priorities and it is important that these other groups get a fair hearing.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes
An independent body would probably be better in this circumstance



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

Another desirable expertise would be social sciences as both climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation will influence
and be influenced by society.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes

It's too late to avoid climate change so we had better be ready to adapt to it.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

I'm worried about how to get people on board (no pun intended) with adaptation. It took us years and dozens of deaths to get
businesses and individuals on board with health and safety; the same thing could happen when adapting to climate change. The UK
has a slightly interesting strategy where any new building placed in a flood plain is legally required to be protected, generally by

raising it off the ground. This is in part a response to the increasing number and severity of floods due to climate change. It might be
worth investigating something similar along the coast, especially for infrastructure hubs (ie electrical substations, wastewater

treatment and water treatment works).



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

I think you'll need compulsory reporting - it does result in more paperwork but is useful both to motivate organisations and inform the
government. However, there are lots of ways nowadays to make reporting easier - online or app-based forms are a good start.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

I'm really, really happy New Zealand is doing this.
