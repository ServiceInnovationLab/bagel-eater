Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Gordon Bruce Tulloch










Reference no: 9516


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 After 25 years of inaction further delay is too dangerous



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Carbon Dioxide - Reducing net carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2050
 Notes

 Reduce both CO2 and methane etc when under human influence. Reduction, not just stabilization



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 With very strong protection against dilution of effectiveness and only with scientific support rather than political expediency



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 With very strong protection against dilution of effectiveness and only with scientific support rather than political expediency
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Must consider Demand/Supply, examine the balance between population plus consumption and the resources necessary to support

these. Infinite growth in demand incompatible with limited resources so a policy on NZ's carrying capacity is essential. Ability to
influence adverse climate inputs without restraining demand is impractical. This will be challenging given expectations of rising

physical standards of living, ability to absorb refugees etc but essential to enable realistic planning.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Provide expert advice and recommendations. Final decisions by Government but these must be clearly measured against Climate
Commission's recommendations and differences or deviations transparently explained. Political record of avoiding responsibility is not
encouraging.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes
As 11. above




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Absolutely. Need all the expert input available including from NGOs




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Beware that "sustainable growth" may not be feasible, especially if population increases significantly. Cannot provide sufficient

affordable housing etc at present so must ensure "growth" is in suitable form to avoid inappropriate waste of precious resources.
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
We also need an examination of what sort of future we can afford. Current encouragement of unsustainable consumption, eg

excessively big and extravagant cars, houses , financial manipulation etc is toxic in the medium and long term. To maintain social
cohesion in rapidly and radically changing times will require major effort and education.
