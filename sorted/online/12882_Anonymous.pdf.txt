Reference no: 12882

Submitter Type:

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes




 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 If the science indicates the target should be brought forward, then we should be prepared to act more aggressively.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 Once the budget is set, it should only be that it is revised downward (i.e. tougher).



 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

 Notes
 Participants in high-emission industries will need support to transition. We should be clear that certain sectors will simply not be

 tenable in the medium term and assist them to transition accordingly. We're beyond the 'economy vs environment' balance now -
 time's too short so it's inevitable that some sectors will take a hit.

 its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
