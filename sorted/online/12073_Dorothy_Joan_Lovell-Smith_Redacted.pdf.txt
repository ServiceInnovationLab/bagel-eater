Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Dorothy Joan Lovell-Smith








Reference no: 12073

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 I think the 2050 target is too far in the future: we are already having extremely heavy rain storms, wind and drought as the result of
 climate change resulting in landslips, floods, forest and bush fires, power outages and millions of dollars worth of damage to land,

 housing and business. Sea level rise will make things much worse. We need to act NOW. Bring the target date forward to 2030 or
 sooner.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived

 gases
 Notes

 The short lived gas methane is the most damaging to the environment so needs to be reduced to a sustainable level starting now.
 Methane, even with its short life, currently contributes a third of our warming emissions, and it must come down, fast, along with all
 other gases. There needs to be research on what is a sustainable level, and means to attain this level worked out. Once they are set

 there should be support for farmers and others to help them attain these levels, regulations set up and enforced to ensure
 sustainable levels are established in our farming culture. We are running out of time. We can't afford a vague belief that says people
 will do the right thing voluntarily or to indulge in a "she'll be right attitude" any more. We also need to take into account the amount of

 methane being released into the atmosphere through the melting of the permafrost, The only way to stop this future catastrophe is
 by slowing the warming now.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes

 I am really worried that we are taking things too lightly. I think we have to get into a :fighting a war" mentality. We have to admit that our
 way of life needs to change dramatically and we will all have to make some changes to our lifestyles. We can't afford the ideas and
 dreams of an ever expanding economy. Farmers need to look at ways to reduce methane and nitrous oxide release. They need to

 reduce the size of their herd and use farm management systems (reduce fertiliser use, change the diet) that are truly sustainable.
 Industry needs to reduce methane leaks from gas and oil wells to zero We need to keep coal, oil,and gas in the ground Government

 support for clean energy heating in all schools, hospitals, public buildings, and to get them and industry like Fonterra's milk treatment
 plants off coal and fossil fuels. We need action on reducing transport emissions through efficiency standards, support for sustainable
 electric public and private transport, reducing speed limits, get away from the idea of public transport for private profit and make sure

 it is a publically owned service that works for the climate, the users and the workers. Encourage everybody to take action in reducing
 their own transport emissions, eg awareness of true cost of air miles in food provision Plant heaps and heaps of trees on every piece
 of spare land. Encourage private tree planting through rates rebates. Set up publicity campaigns about the importance of preserving

 and planting trees for short term use and long term sustainability Research and communicate the results to public on the best sort of
 trees for different uses and regions.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 We should NOT be able to push the target back, based on economic reasons as it would cause too much uncertainty, but we should

 be able to bring the emissions target forward if new evidence of what is a safe target is produced. When science says things are
 really urgent, we need to take notice of this.
Clause
5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
Position

No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
Notes




Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.

However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in scientific understanding or international agreements should be
permitted.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
I agree with the 350.orgs summary that supports the Government and the Climate Commission taking the following factors into
consideration when advising on and setting budgets: Scientific knowledge regarding climate change (his is the most important

factor) Technology relevant to climate change Economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the economy
considered in its broadest sense, not just the current free-market or financial system. Social justice and the need for a fair and just

transition to a low carbon economy, so that people on low incomes are not disadvantaged by the changes. Fiscal circumstances and
the likely impact of the decision on taxation, public spending and public borrowing, with consideration of the long-term goal of moving

to an economy that is sustainable within resource and environmental constraints and that is not based on the assumption of
continual and destructive ‘economic growth. Energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy supplies and the carbon and

energy intensity of the economy.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
And keep to the time frame!



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable,

and reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi. They should include consideration of: The real urgency of the current climate crisis
The need to include all aspects of society and the economy, including comprehensive education and publicity campaigns in all
languages,that encourage people to feel that they are part of the solution as well as being part of the problem. The urgent need to

move away from the ‘endless growth’ model for the economy and to support economic and social structures that are environmentally
sustainable for future generations, as well as fair and equitable so that all citizens will support it.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
The CC Commission should be an independent non-partisan body that supports and undertakes research and gives advice but does
not make the final decisions. Communication with Parliament and the public needs to be there at all times It needs to have enough

clout to be taken seriously by Government.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

Again quoting from 350.org response..... I support the introduction of a carbon tax rather than maintenance of the current NZ ETS
and would hope that the Commission will recommend the most effective form of such a tax. Whatever mechanism is chosen to put a

price on carbon, I support the Commission making recommendations for this mechanism but the implementation of such a
mechanism should be the responsibility of the Government.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Commissionerss should have expertise in the following fields: Climate change policy (including carbon tax/emissions trading)
Resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, impact on socio-economic equity and ways of achieving a fair and just

transition Te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests Knowledge and awareness of our Pacific Island
neighbours needs Climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori Experience with addressing adaptation challenges

like planning, insurance and local government Risk management Engineering and/or infrastructure Community engagement and
communications. Business competitiveness Knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology development system.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

As I mention in my answer to question 1 I am very concerned about the effects of climate change already being experienced by New
Zealanders and our Pacific island neighbours. Having lived through the devastation of the Canterbury earthquakes and the problems

with insurance that have and still are, causing misery for many people, I can see that we need to think of the huge cost in the future
of doing nothing or not enough now



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
I agree with the proposed functions below, but feel it is important that local authorities and community and sector groups have a say
in how this is done: a national climate change risk assessment a national adaptation plan, that supports local government. regular

review of progress towards implementing the national adaptation plan regular and ongoing communication with the public on risk and
the management of risk an adaptation reporting power




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes

Notes
regular and ongoing communication with the public on risk and the management of risk an adaptation reporting power




Clause
