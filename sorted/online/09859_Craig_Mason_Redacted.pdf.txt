Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

      Craig Mason








Reference no: 9859

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No

 Notes



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 No

 Notes
 Needs to put in place a plan now to get to zero emissions and not deviate from it. The temptation for economic reasons is to deviate
 from the plan.




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
Just set the budget and require each sector to meet their share of the emissions reduction regardless of the consequences.

Otherwise each sector will try to worm its way out.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes
Forget about emissions trading. Each sector should have to work out its own way of dealing with their emissions eliminations.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes
It will have to, because many countries may not play their part. Wealthier western countries will have to lead by example. Even then we

are likely to be swamped with refugees fleeing climate change.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
Not sure what these are, other than Shane Jones running round with a bag of money and puting this into dubious planting schemes
in Northland.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Notes
Not sure, but think it would be better if we set up programmes that explored getting rid of ruminant farming and replacing it with crop

farming to produce genetic meat, milk and also lignin to replace plastic. Using television and the internet in a 3D hyperactive way so
that people didn't have to air travel to experience another country. Putting a limit on the tourists coming to NZ and targeting the high

end of the market. Putting a limit on the population of NZ and managing the economy so that its not dependent on constant growth.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
NZ's a great place to live but over my lifetime I've seen the environment degrade and I despair at what we are leaving for those that

come after us
