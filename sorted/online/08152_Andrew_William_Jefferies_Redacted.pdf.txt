Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Andrew William Jefferies




Reference no: 8152

Submitter Type:

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later

 Notes
 The current government is a coalition of parties that have disparate goals and should not be locking in legislation that will effect New

 Zealanders for decades to come, as they do not have a mandate for this. Setting a goal and a non political body of scientists and
 engineers that can then take into account information as it evolves would be prudent.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 Must include overseas offsets particularly in CO2.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes
 New Zealand cannot act alone and the onus should be on enabling real progress in reducing overseas emissions not disabling the

 NZ economy. Export of NZ LNG/gas based methanol would achieve a remarkable impact.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Over the last 3 decades various claims have been made around climate change trajectory risks and benefits, understanding of these
 will change with time. The climate is dynamic and decision making should be also.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 Technology and understanding can change in 5 years a 3 year target and 5 of them is more appropriate.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 I believe that all the budgets should be subject to review by government and the commission based on new information and the
latest thinking not just the third budget.




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
However there should also be a focus on the global opportunities to reduce emissions elsewhere despite generation of emissions

locals and the offsetting of this.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
No

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

NZ energy needs costs and energy security (working with treasury and industry), the needs of overseas developing nations that
require energy (working with the UN)




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
There needs to be an additional function of interacting with the global forums on climate change as the single voice of the NZ

government. This is a global problem not a local one.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
international business competitiveness needs to be a skill represented as does climate mitigation in a global sense (may come

through the climate person) and global emission trading. The members should be a-political and required to act on the basis of facts
and informed thinking not ideology, and also recruited without racial bias.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes
climate has been changing for the worlds history and particularly since the last ice age, humans need to adapt to a changing climate

or they go the way of the Babylonians, Romans and Mayans all of whom suffered catastrophic change due to changes in climate.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No
Notes

The functions look at climate change as a negative "risk" only the remit needs to look also at benefits that will arise from climate
changes and how we can capture these.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
information is valuable in a market economy it ensures correct decisions are taken.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

The climate has been changing since the last ice age, and at times much more rapidly than at present. The commission needs to
take a balanced and informed view of the issues involved as the financial and living standard implications of changes in our climate.

Energy will be an important element in allowing us to cope with climate change, and the loss of the benefits of farming and energy
production to New Zealanders has to be carefully weighed against the greenhouse gas emission effects, and how these fit into the

global emissions pool. Mans effect on the climate is a global issue and should be resolved primarily at global forums.
