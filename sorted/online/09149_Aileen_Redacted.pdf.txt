Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

TRUTH (Aileen)




Reference no: 9149

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 The process of investigating and speaking out about Geo-egineering.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes
 None of the above. GEO-ENGINEERING needs to have an immediate target to makes sure all climate manipulation is ended.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 The above does not apply as the GEO-ENGINEERING is eradicating forests, wildlife, insects, birds. Ending geo-eingeering means we
 will once again have a strong environment.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Notes
 This is irrelevant as the Zero Carbon Bill is part of Agenda 21. Revise this Agenda signed in 1992 in Rio, at the Earth Summit.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 This is a waste of time as this is part of Agenda 21. STOP THE GEO-ENGINEERING! which is deliberate manipulation of the weather by
 those who have the technology and creating havoc on this planet.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes
 IRRELEVANT.. Do your job and address the myth of climate change caused by the ordinary person and address the issue of deliberate

 climate change through deliberate GEO-ENGINEERING.This



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes
 This is irrelevant as the government is corrupt and colluding in the geo-engineering.




 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Notes
 I don't agree with anything you are doing or saying. It is heinously criminal to be involved in duping the public and colluding with

 corrupt power that uses technology to deliberately geo-engineer the weather.



 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Notes

 Zero Carbon is part of Agenda 21, this has been ongoing....time to end it.
Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
You need to work with Dane Wigington and Matt Landman to end the geo-engineering. Two extremely intelligent knowledgeable

people who are experts in the deliberate climate change through geo-engineering. Then you come to truthfulness to the public.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

The Climate Change Commission has been wholly neglectful and irresponsible in its duty to examine and expose the deliberate
climate change through geo-engineering.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Notes
The Climate Change Commission is defunct and neglectful in its duties and therefore will do nothing in relation to the NZETS.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Notes
The expertise required is through consulting experts in this area such as Dane Wigington, world expert and scientist regarding

deliberate climate change through geo-engineering. Failure to address this shows the public that there are few in govt who have
essential and desirable expertise because they are ill-informed and neglectful in taking care of the country, humanity and life.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes

The Zero Carbon Bill is nonsense and proposes nothing but acquienscence to geo-engineering.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

The government must tackle geo-engineering. Nothing the government is currently doing is adapting to 'climate change' because
they are not addressing the real and truthful issue - GEO-ENGINEERING.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Notes
Interview and work with Dane Wigington, develop the capacity for compassion, vision, wisdom and truthfulness and stop buying into

the globalists reach for control of the world through geo-engineering.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Do your job! As human beings, you need to wake up, take responsibility, develop and grow in wisdom and compassion, leave the

greed and narcissism behind , STAND UP AND SPEAK TRUTH TO POWER BEYOND YOURSELVES , otherwise you will destroy this
country.
