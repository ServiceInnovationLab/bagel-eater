Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Jennifer baker, Jennifer Kathleen Baker









Reference no: 12252

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes
 This to include how it will be achieved and a transition path



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 Differentiate between long lived and short lived gases and achieve negative levels of long lived gases while reducing short lived

 gases to zero.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 The emissions from transport , industrial activities, agriculture and all other sources should be included in the target. There needs to
 be true cost carbon accounting that accounts for all externalities e.g industrial plantation forestry emits huge carbon loads through

 maintenance, harvesting, transport, effects on roads,etc which negate the sequestration benefits



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes

 Not for any economic convenience but only to improve the rates of carbon reduction and emission targets. Could be brought forward
 in response to new science which indicates further reductions for a safe climate



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 As in 4 only to improve emissions reduction rates in response to major scientific knowledge.




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 As above.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
No

Notes
As above




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes I agree with all but they must not trump the reduction of cumulative emissions sufficient to avoid dangerous climate change and

the greatest emission cuts to CO2 must occur in the first 10 years.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
There must be set published time frames and a transition pathway after each budget is announced



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Policy and plans must be equitable, comprehensive, ecologically sustainable,include a huge educational component across the

whole of society and show a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi. Need to help the community join the dots between their
cations/choices and climate change and these be related to targets and budgets.Foster a spirit of achievability.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
The government should be legally required to consider and formally respond to the Commission's advice and achieve targets. It also
has the role of watchdog and must publish progress reports




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

In addition to those listed "resource economics" must include ecological economics and true cost accounting. The Commission also
requires experts who understand ecological impacts of implementation plans and experts in systems thinking and bio feedback.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes, in order to prepare for impacts that can't be avoided. A National Adaption Plan needs to be developed and clear and consistent
directions given to local government. Again this requires an extensive education component.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Targets must be bold.
