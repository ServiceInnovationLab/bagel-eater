Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Simon Jackson






Reference no: 17


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 2050 is too long. Can't it be sooner? By 2050 we could already be hitting 3 degrees. We don't have time to be conservative on this.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 Why "net" zero, and not just zero. I am concerned that calculations of "net" will lead to conflict and the potential for corruption.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Circumstances will change, probably for the worse. Latest predictions from UN are that we may already have passed the 3 degree
 threshold. As well as prevention, we need a strategy for mitigation.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes

 I understand the approach but 5 years is too long, and creates a temptation to do nothing for 4.5 years. 3 years, with yearly reviews,
 would be better.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
Monitored and reported, updated as frequently as the weather



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Good question. First Nations groups, environmental orgs, industry and major polluters, the Opposition - to try and ensure this doesn't

get rolled back.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Very strongly agree and NZ is a leader here.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes
Ability to fine/sue unresponsive organizations or industries. Need a stick as well as a carrot




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
Not each person needs the same expertise. Fine to have specialists with particular expertise - scientific, social, environmental,

political. Best to get a healthy tension than try for perfection. Make it democratic?



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes
Absolutely. We are already experiencing the early effects of CC. We must hope the best, plan for the worst.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
Thank you for this initiative. I don't know of another country showing this leadership and preparation. The temptation is to say 'oh, NZ

is small we can't make a difference' - but leadership like this can ring around the world.
