Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill







Reference no: 2122

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes

 If the target is set by the commission this will help separate it from party politics and bias which could undermine the goal.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 NZ needs to stop pretending its forestry will save it, eventually those trees will be cut down and burned up or processed in some
 manner. Just go all the way and end carbon emissions from man made sources, even if we fall short with an ambitious goal we should
 be able to get fairly close.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 The second option of buying from overseas allows us to not actually focus on reducing our emissions and instead buy others

 success. That wouldn't make us "clean and green" just well off enough to buy another country's clean air to offset our own
 emissions. That's not real progress.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 What is put in place later cannot be any less ambitious, the ultimate goal shouldn't change only the methods of getting there.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes
 Again reiterate that change could be made to the methods as long as the overall target remains the same - of course there is the risk

 that with changing political agendas this will result in no progress due to flip flopping on policy and cosying to certain voters, it may be
 better to lock it in.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 If it is limiting it further, i.e. new scientific discoveries mean we have to reduce the carbon budget significantly, but it shouldn't be
 made any more lax.



 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

 Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Putting in place real tools to drive change rather than being afraid they'll lose voters.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes

But the commission shouldn't be responsible for it, the focus on getting to a net zero emissions state is a lofty enough goal without
the added adaptation mandate.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
