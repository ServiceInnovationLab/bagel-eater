Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 12439

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 Methane makes up such a huge portion of our emissions as a nation. It makes no sense to avoid regulating it; if we do not drastically
 reduce methane emissions we will not be able to meet our international climate change obligations. The fact that methane is a short-
 lived gas should not exempt it from regulation, because it is in the short term that we face great climatic danger.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 The Bill should allow the target to be made more ambitious, but not allow the target to be made less ambitious.




 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
 its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
 Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Commissioners must have no conflicts of interest.



 Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
Primary producers are already suffering financially from climate change. We need to begin increasing resilience on farms immediately.

There are numerous on-farm practices that can help farmers better cope with drought, for example. The government needs to
actively promote these strategies.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
New Zealand has the opportunity to lead the world in climate-friendly agriculture, but this requires bold thinking. All agricultural

emissions must be considered if we are to make a meaningful contribution to combatting climate change. However, we also need to
give farmers the opportunity to earn carbon credits by sequestering carbon in soils. The potential carbon sink in our soils is massive.
More research may be needed in order to design a scheme that works for NZ, however overseas countries are already looking into

this. This report from the Rodale Institute details the potential carbon sequestration power of regenerative agricultural practices:
