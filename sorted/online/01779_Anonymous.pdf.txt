Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 1779

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 If a target is not mandated in legislation there is no accountability as to enforceable action to achieve it.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 A zero emission reduction target should relate to all anthropocentric produced waste and gas emissions. Every Region and every
 local authority needs to have a emissions profile and a reduction target. Not good enough to say that nationally NZ emission are

 declining while Auckland City emissions are increasing.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 It's more ethical and globally responsible to not trade away NZ emission reductions using another countries credit reductions.
 Instead, develop a knowledge base of managing emission reductions within our domestic economy and market and sell that IP

 overseas.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 yes, in terms of a net reduction of waste/gas emissions. But not where one or some industries (such as Dairy, large industrial
 manufacturing (pulp/paper, steel, chemical components, mining) are provided perverse incentive to increase gross pollution or
 emissions.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 I am not an atmospheric expert. i intuitively consider that if a target for 2050 is being set that budgets should be set for 2030, 2040,
 with reviews at 2025, 2035, and 2045. Five does not seem to be significant enough time period to demonstrate definite trends in

 reducing waste/gas emission. What is the correlation with global target dates for gas emission reductions?



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes

 The reality is that every incoming Government of varying MMP make will seek to review emissions budgets. Any changes should only
 be in terms of reductions and no individual gas emission increases.
Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

As above for 6 and 4



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

considerations should be weighted in term sof more emphasis on first 3 bullets, less emphasis on 3rd, 4th and 5th bullet points.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes, plans need to be shown as being able to be implemented and open to scrutiny of NZ public.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Setting a budget needs to incorporate all types of emissions, without special favoritism that advantage one industry emitter or area

over another.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Climate Change Comission should have advisory function with accountability function similar to Parliamentary Commissioner for
Environment and Ombudsman offices.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
Only in terms of emission reductions. Providing in this legislation a directive for adapting to climate is diluting the effectiveness of
emissions reduction targets.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Agree with function but think that what is set out on pages 47 and 48 should be under separate legislation to emissions reductions.
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

All public organisations with control over property and control over the degree of risk to the public from that property in terms of
climate change must share information on their risk. This should include central government, local government, council controlled

organisations, public companies, private companies that offer publicly investment options (crowd funding, or investment by equity
funds).
