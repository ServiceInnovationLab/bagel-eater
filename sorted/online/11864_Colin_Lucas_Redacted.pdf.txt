 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 No emissions targets should be set. To do so is to create an enormous ponzi scheme



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes
 The government should not set a target.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 If the government does not set a target then there is no target to meet.



 Clause

 Notes
 The Zero Carbon Bill is an economy killer. it should not be enacted.



 Clause

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 I do not accept the proposal.

 No. the government should not be forced to set out unworkable plans.



 Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

The government should not set any plans. The government needs to consider supporting the countries economy rather than
crashing it.

No, As i have said the Climate change commission serves no useful purpose and needs to be closed down.

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

No.

Notes

This bill is an economy killer and will affect, if it is passed those in our society who can least afford it. The bill should be removed from
the legislative program.
