 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 None it's the biggest fraud going at the moment CO2 is not a pollutant, do you want plants to grow or not.

 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Notes

 There should be no budget. This is just a big waste of net tax payer money.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes

 There should be no budget. It would be better to just burn the money instead, that way we would at least see where it went.

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

This is a pile of sh1t, a fraud, and a complete waste of money just to make some pm's get a job after they've kicked out of
government. Get a real f**ki*g job!

Remove the climate change commission, and do something productive.

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Notes

The should be no targets full stop.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Stop the virtual signaling. The science has never been settled. How can you be so arrogant to think the very very small amount of

CO2 human activity has put into the atmosphere is causing climate change when it changes all the time throughout the earths
history. Is is a job for sh1ts who could never earn a living in the real world. I'm sick and tired if having to pay for this sh1t forced upon
me when it is such a fraud. Coming up with this proves pig sh1t has more use than you.
