Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 2207

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 We have to take climate change really seriously - this is our only chance to make the changes we need to avoid even more suffering -
 I know how traumatic it is - my house was condemned in 2011- it was truly horrendous.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 We have to take climate change seriously. My house was condemned in 2011 due to " unprecedented floods " ie a euphemism for

 climate change. As a GP we had so many people in the Riwaka + Mapua area really struggling from effects of climate change.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 only if the climate issues gets worse then we need to accelerate this process..




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 yes but only under exceptional circumstances. We need to set down clearly what we as a country intend to do and not allow any
 future government to change these proposals for political gain.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Not only do we need to reach targets but we also need to look after people affected by climate change. When my house was

condemned in 2011 I got not support at all.....I was shocked and distressed. AS a GP I have seen people after the latest floods - many
in shock and very distressed. There needs to be funding set aside to help people and councils dealing with effects of climate

change.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

I would like to see the climate change commission being made up of : scientists, academics and activists - It is important that NO
climate change deniers are allowed on the commission so thwarting their progress.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

We actually don't know how fast climate change it going to happen ......and so we need to be mindful of this and adapt and speed up
the process if need be.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
I want to see real change - not just lip service.....this requires adequate funding and priority. Central government must help local

councils with funding. I would also like to see central government putting funding and tax cuts to individual householders who instal
solar and who switch to EVs.......this has to be supported by central government....please
