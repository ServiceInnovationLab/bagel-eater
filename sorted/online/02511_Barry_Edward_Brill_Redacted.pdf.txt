Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Barry Brill, B E Brill Ltd (Barry Edward Brill)








Reference no: 2511

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 None of the above. It is far too early to set credible goals or targets for an unknowable 30+ years in the future



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes
 None of the above. The figure 'zero' is arbitrary and unjustiable.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes
 NZ outlays should always be invested in the highest available returns (in terms of global emission reductions). The tonnes/dollar rate
 is paramount.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 If not, the ZC Act would simply be repealed when circumstances change



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 Every business know that a budget for even 5 years ahead is useless. Worse, it inhibits (and is designed to inhibit) essential flexibility,
 innovation, and continuous improvement in methodology.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes
 Under the NZ constitution, each incoming Government has the option to repeal or amend the ZC Act. It will do so regularly if the

 original Act does not allow elected representatives to deliver upon their mandate.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 With the support of Parliament, the elected Government should adjust any budget when the (now unforeseeable) circumstances
 make it sensible and prudent to do so.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Global leadership is pure ministerial egoism and an unworthy objective. A major consideration should be doing our "fair share" as
measured by the rate of change in the emissions intensity of our GDP compared with that of comparable OECD countries.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

No budget should ever be accepted by any Government without first setting out plans to achieve it and determining whether those
plans are deliverable.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The most important issue is to evaluate any budget in terms of its benefits and costs and determine whether it is in the best

interests of the New Zealand people. That implies transparency and consultation.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes
The Commission's role should be primarily statistical, in monitoring our progress towards goals and comparing with the progress

being made by other OECD countries. It should be free to offer advice to the Government – which would be considered along with
advice from Departments of State and other normal sources.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
ETS policy should be "set and forget" if it is ever to operate as an efficient market. Neither the Commission nor any other Agency

should be twiddling knobs and shifting goalposts in a sector which is characteristically long-term.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

The Commission's role is to assist efficient execution of a predetermined Government policy – and not to either attack or change that
policy. It has no need for expertise in environmental science or law. Its principal need is an understanding (born of experience) of what

will work and what will not. Secondly, it needs to understand business.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
Adaptation needs should evolve from monitoring actual medium-term temperature changes and actual impacts within each local
authority district. A tailored but nationally-consistent plan should emerge for consideration on a district-by-district basis.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
The suggestion of a black-letter law requiring that "we" understand all risks is absurd, and simply invites regular judicial review

proceedings to challenge the Commission's opinions. Plans should emerge as the underlying data become available. While there is
no evidence of any warming in New Zealand in recent decades, the Commission should monitor and report annually.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
No
Notes

Overriding existing privacy laws is both draconian and unnecessary. What is meant by "organisations"? Why would a private company's
risk management become the subject of public debate? matter of




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
This is a thoroughly bad proposal. Its benefits and risks are neither identified nor quantified. There is no single tangible benefit that
could not be achieved at a fraction of the cost of this Bill
