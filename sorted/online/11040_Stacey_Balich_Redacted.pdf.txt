 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes



 Clause

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes



 Clause

 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

We need to get all the council's involved, schools, community groups. There is a lot of money being spent on recycle education and
community groups but this is just as important. Education is key. Also more car charging points. I have an electric car and we need

more charger points in Auckland. There is a good number that they are often full. Which is great in one way but this could put off
people looking at getting a car.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes
Make decisions themselves. Allowing the govt to makes me nervous as they will be making their decisions on profit they may loss.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
Love this idea. Transparency is key
