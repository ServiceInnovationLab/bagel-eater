Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Kerry Worsnop






Reference no: 9740


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Carbon Dioxide - Reducing net carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2050
 Notes

 This is the area of emissions which has shown the most growth and has the most potential to continue growing, and where we have
 real options to reduce this growth. We will have a much better chance of achieving our goals if we focus narrowly on something we
 can have a big impact on.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 Emissions reduction targets should be set at a regional level to ensure that low emitting regions are not made to shoulder the
 burden for high emitting regions, and to ensure that regions with a low emissions profile are recognised as such. This would also
 encourage a more equal distribution of economic activity. There is also a huge need for recognition of the means of sequestering

 emissions to be more broadly recognised, as currently very little of the nations vegetative cover and stored carbon is recognised as
 providing a service. I would also like to add that it seems utterly pointless for a nation with as much natural and exotic forest cover,

 with such a small population to be paying another nation to 'sequester' carbon.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 We could have a volcanic eruption and out targets would go out the window. Also our science is evolving which requires our
 legislation to evolve with it. (ie wetlands are great for biodiversity and water quality but are high emitters of methane which is still not
 recognised by agricultural emissions modelling on farm emissions.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 I think you are better to have a ten and 15 budget, 5 years is not enough for business certainty.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Notes
 As stated earlier, I believe the science will continue to change requiring flexibility in the way budgets are set and met.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes

 See above
Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes

This makes sense



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The government should ensure the framework is set to ensure the prosperity and resilience of the New Zealand people. They should
ensure that the system 'transition' is not structured in a way that creates a burden on the economic system which is required to pay

for his transition. The government will need the support of its largest industry's and should therefore work in partnership with them



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
This provision should simply be part of governance regardless of climate change, it is known as planning for the uncertain future.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
Some areas will face different issues and this may be information which needs to be captured. However I would caution against

setting up so many administration levels that the mechanism becomes unwieldy and expensive to operate. I would put the onus of
this reporting on existing ministries.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

I would like to highlight the fact that the discussion document was poorly written (leading) and unnecessarily inaccessible to non-
academic readers, which has resulted in a number of people ringing me to ask for an interpretation of said document. This clearly

shows the document was not fit for purpose and failed to inform the people it was directed towards (the public). For this reason I
believe the submissions recieved will be heavily biased toward academia and environmental lobby groups who have the means of
diseminating the information they would like to see recorded in submissions. I would also note that in its current form the document

does little to clealy inform the reader of the implications of the different types of gasses being included (is methane increasing
warming or not?) or excluded in the bill, and the how these would be taxed and what the resulting social, economic and

environemental landscape would look like; the inclusion of the pictorial model hardly does justice to what could be a hugely varied
and largely unpresidented distortion of the economic environment as we know it. Lastly the reliance of planting trees is highly

concerning, given that globally planation forestry has increased on an immense scale and is therefore likely at some point to become
depressed (potentially disastrously so). There are also many assumed and unqualified assertions in the discussion document
relating to the improvement plantation forestry is 'known' to have on water quality, biodiversity and erosion. The government will be

aware that this is not true in some landscapes as evidenced by recent examples of erosion prone land suffering catastrophic damage
following harvest, and the flow-on effects in waterways, research in the space is ongoing. The public requires balanced information

which is clear and unbias if they are to make an informed submission, something that the discussion document failed to provide.
