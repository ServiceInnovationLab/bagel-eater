 Clause

 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

 Notes
 Carbon equity. E.g. if cost of travel goes up how can current spread of opportunity be maintained, or even improved. Public access.
 E.g. if there are increased permanent forestry plantings how can community/recreational access to forestry land be protected or

 enhanced? (especially as these forests are sold to international funds etc).
