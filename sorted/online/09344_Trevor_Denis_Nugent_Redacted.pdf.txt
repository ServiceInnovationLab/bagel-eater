Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Trevor Denis Nugent








Reference no: 9344

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 Using international credits doesn't necessarily provide a net benefit in a global sense.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 Parliament can always amend legislation. That is the process that should be used rather than some administrative option provided in

 the legislation. It is a matter that concerns all New Zealanders, not just the government of the day.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 but the type of exceptional circumstance should be spelt out.



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The success or otherwise of policies and methods used to date; The social impact of policies proposed versus the social impact of

the effects of climate change; The probable effectiveness of policies and methods proposed.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
However, the Government should be required to publish reasons for any divergence from the Commission's advice.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

The Commission is the appropriate body to undertake risk assessment and recommend policy responses that the Government
could initiate. Having central government undertake the first risk assessment while the Commission is established is practical, but the

Commission should have the opportunity to review and comment on it once established.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

Mandatory reporting by infrastructure providers, local and central government, Crown-entities/SOEs to the Commission would be
necessary to provide the factual basis of any risk assessment.
Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
The Climate Change Commission should be established under a legislative framework that ensured it was not disbanded at the whim

of any future government. Given that political circumstances in New Zealand where, in almost all situations, the government of the
day controls Parliament, and the constitutional ability of Parliament to amend or repeal any statutes, some legislative security needs to
be provided for the Commission.
