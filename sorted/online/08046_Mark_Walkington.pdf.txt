Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Mark Walkington








Reference no: 8046

Submitter Type:

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 There is little to no choice here really given the need to attempt to avert runaway and catastrophic climate change we now face. And
 as mitigation options abound we have to take on the challenge. The "Net" allows for plenty of domestic offsetting - to mop up a
 hopefully future low level of gross emissions. Measures will likely need to include a major move away from high GHG primary industries

 including livestock and dairy.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 Lets Do This. I propose a Fee and Dividend to replace the ETS - thus no need for ETS international trading/linkages - targets are NZ
 based and delivered.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Yes - required 2/3rd majority of parliament.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Sounds a reasonable approach - I would urge annual reporting and review.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes - Government should have ability to model emission scenarios, point to expected measures and outcomes and monitor emission
annually against the projections. The Commission would highlight performance against the projection and raise alarms where we are

seen falling short.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The emission reductions must be domestically focused. Plans should be made on a sector by sector basis - with sector specific
targets - not necessarily at the same reduction level but such that aggregate reductions meet targets. Modelling should identify the

likeliest low cost emission reductions and this basis could be used to plan to meet budgets.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
I tend to the "Advisory, with mechanisms built in to hold Government to account " model.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes
Government should consider an appropriate replacement of the ETS with a Carbon Fee and Dividend scheme with polluters paying,

carbon price fixed to increasing and proceeds paid to sequesters (e.g. forest owners) and the rest paid to the population on a per
capita basis. Border issues should be handled - tariffs on carbon content basis where country of origin has imposed lower carbon

pricing.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

I partially agree but also feel the Commission should include suitable citizens representation - perhaps a great use of online election
of Commissionaires. The Commission should not make appointments to those with a direct track record working amongst our major

emitting corporates or bodies representing those industries - we know who they are - fossil fuels, dairy, transport, banking.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
I am strongly opposed to this suggestion. That is a job for other bodies including current local government, Infrastructure planners,

Civil Defence, Emergency Services/Military etc. The Zero Carbon Bill has suitable focus on carbon reduction/mitigation and concerns
about adaption would distract if dealt with by the same body/act.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

The introduction of this bill is a great step and very required - although decades too late. Government needs to keep continual focus
on emission reduction and be prepared for NZ to take necessary measures to lead in the battle against Carbon. Much education is

needed - this is certainly part of the role for the Climate Commission. Threats to the successful meeting of the budget need to be
identified and handled. Similarly win-win scenarios abound in this space e.g. tourism, public health, efficiency and cost reduction, new

technology and innovation, green jobs ...... and much can be made of each step we make on our way to Net Zero. Consideration
needs to be given to changing market structures where current arrangements have been seen to work against the need for change.
Examples include electricity where incumbents generators are happy to delay the build of renewable generation - for fear of lowering

market prices and disturbing windfall profits. If we are to see a widespread electrification of transport and industry then it is likely that
new wind and geothermal generation will be needed post haste. Similarly infrastructure provision such as EV Charging requires a role

for the state either significant funding or direct action (e.g. California) - here benefits are spread widely and do not make a commercial
profit easily achieved.
