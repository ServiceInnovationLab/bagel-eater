Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Margaret Ruth Lovell-Smith








Reference no: 10153

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 Storms, floods, heat-waves, landslides, sea-level rise. Climate change is already happening and is going to get worse. Our children
 and grandchildren face a frightening future and the sooner we begin working as a nation, and in our local communities, towards a

 clear target, the better. But bring the date forward to 2040.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 The situation is urgent. Let's bring forward the target date to 2040 and let's make it a gross emission target rather than a net one.
 Let's also strengthen our 2030 Paris Agreement target and set robust five and ten year targets. Not only is this crucial for our future

 well-being but also sends a clear message that we are a responsible nation, serious about addressing the greatest threat humankind
 has faced.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 I would rule out the words 'including from new forest planting'. It is important that we reduce our domestic emissions without relying
 on other countries to do it for us. I suggest we also monitor and set limits on cumulative emissions. International carbon units could

 also be bought it if helps less affluent countries meet their targets.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 But only if new scientific evidence shows the target to be outdated; or if the international community demands a more ambitious
 target.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Possibly under exceptional circumstances, for example a major natural disaster.



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

But new economic models and ways of doing things are also necessary. Competitiveness in the past has led to scant consideration
for environmental impacts. All human activity in future needs to be sustainable, and those who create environmental degradation
need to be accountable.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes there should be a strict timeframe of six months after an emissions budget has been set.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
I agree with Generation Zero that the Government's policy plans must be "comprehensive, fair, cost effective, environmentally
sustainable and reflect a commitment to the Tiriti o Waitangi". A holistic approach that considers future generations and the impact of

climate change on the most vulnerable members of society is needed.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

Expertise in public health should be added to the list. A separate committee focussing on adaptation issues, and providing help and
advice to local bodies would be a good idea.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

I am in full support of the Zero Carbon Act and appreciate the opportunity to contribute to the discussion.
