Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Sarah Gay Lightbody









Reference no: 9266

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes
 We need to aim for zero net emissions by 2050 at the very latest, set firmly in legislation. A net zero emissions goal means aiming for

 the greenhouse gases we emit as a country to be equal or less than what we draw back down, like by planting forests.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 The most ambitious target: reducing total greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to
 ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while

 reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the

 ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific understanding or international agreements should be permitted.
 This includes bringing forward the target to get to net zero emissions if scientific advancements shows this is necessary.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that 3 are in effect at all times.




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 Emissions budgets should not be altered in response to “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty. However,
 the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in scientific understanding or international agreements should be permitted.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

As I said above, emissions budgets should not be altered in response to “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term
certainty. However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in scientific understanding or international agreements

should be permitted.



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should take the following factors into consideration when advising on and
setting budgets: • scientific knowledge regarding climate change • technology relevant to climate change • economic
circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the

economy • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on taxation, public spending and public borrowing • social
circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel poverty • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy

supplies and the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes
We must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable,

and reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

The Commission should not be a decision-making body.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to
the number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
I agree with the following collective expertise: • climate change policy (including emissions trading) • resource economics and

impacts (including social impacts, labour markets and distribution) • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori
interests • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like
planning, insurance and local government • risk management • engineering and/or infrastructure • community engagement and

communications. • business competitiveness • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology development system.
I think expertise in public health is also important.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes

This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within the Climate Commission.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance is required in terms of how local councils are involved: • a
national climate change risk assessment • a national adaptation plan • regular review of progress towards implementing the national

adaptation plan • an adaptation reporting power



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

I strongly believe we need to set our targets, as a planet, for global warming to 1.5 degrees, not 2 degrees. 2 degrees is too warm for
many of our native species to survive. We need to lead this by example, in NZ, by setting bold zero emissions targets and achieving

this. This must be "set in stone", a piece of legislation that is not going to be overturned by different political parties being in
government, Our future depends on it. I am so excited our nation is working on this now, we have hope and can be an amazing

example to the rest of the world by doing this.
