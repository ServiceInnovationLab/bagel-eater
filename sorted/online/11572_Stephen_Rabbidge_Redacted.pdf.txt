 No reduction targets necessary.Start reading the science that confirms that Man does not have any affect on “Climate Change”



 Clause

 Notes
 NONE ...Targets completely unnecessary



 Clause

 Notes

 As above ...No targets required .Climate change is the biggest hoax in the history of mankind.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Yes

 If any targets are introduced they will have to be revised when the countries economy collapses because of this stupidity.

 More ideological nonsense

 As above



 Clause

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
 Climate Change Commission should be disbanded and declared irrelevant.



 Clause

 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 The Zero Carbon bill will confirm to the rest of the world how ridiculous it is to attempt to change the weather...unbelievable stupidity.



 Clause

 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
 Notes

 Realists who recognise a scam when they see it.
Clause

NONE !! Both the Commission and an ETS have been devised to deal with an issue that does not exist.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

It is essential and desirable that they all find other jobs that will contribute to our future ...not destroy it.

No
Notes

exposure to climate change risks?

Notes
More beaurocratic rubbish .



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

I only hope that politicians and Climate Change theorists realise that the notion of climate being affected by man is an absolute con
before it is too late. History will show that supporters of such a proposal will be the laughing stock of future qenerations.
