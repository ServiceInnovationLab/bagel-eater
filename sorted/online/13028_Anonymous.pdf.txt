 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 Notes
 To make it more stringent only.



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes

 I agree that the the technology and scientific basis needs to be included - But the economic and social elements risk softening the
impact of a commission and we have ministries set up to consider how to deal with the outcomes already. If we do not deal to climate

changes, we will face far worse poverty and economic conditions as people become displaced internationally and climates shift the
distribution of arable land.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

And be held accountable if targets are not met in those timeframes.



Clause

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Current emitters, technology industries,

Position

Yes
Notes




Clause

Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

If CRI's and outsourcing to specialist, and current expertise can also be sought.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
Is a carbon bill that doesn't offer mechanisms for adaptation potentially ineffectual, i.e. who has the power to force the target. While it

could be seen as something taking away from the primary goal of the plan, and possibly falls under a different bill. The process of
forcing these discussions and plans, however places the consequences of inaction in the forefront of business, and may be an

important aid in looking at what changes can be made to achieve zero emissions faster.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
Definitely. These discussions need to start NOW and really start to think about what they might be facing.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
