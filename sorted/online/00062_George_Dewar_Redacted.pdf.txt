Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

George Dewar




Reference no: 62

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes




 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 Using units from overseas would be acceptable to me only as a last resort. I think we have a duty to implement our own emissions

 reductions here.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes

 It can always be revised via new legislation, and that seems like the right hoop to have to jump through to me.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Those circumstances would need to be properly defined, and the decision to change the budget should ensure that the 2050 target
 can still be met.



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
Notes

I am concerned about the Climate Change Commission taking factors such as fuel poverty into account, unless they can make
recommendations that include policy to address these issues. The Commission could not operate effectively if it felt, for example,

that setting a high price on emissions would unduly disadvantage the poor through high fuel prices, but could not recommend or
assume that the government implement policy (such as an increase to income support). The Commission should either have the

power to advise on policy changes to mitigate social concerns, or not be required to take them into account and leave this to the
Government to address. Furthermore, consideration should be given to whether the considerations need to be weighted. For
example, economic and fiscal considerations are important, but should not be allowed to prevent the target from being reached. If

the Government of the day is unwilling to implement recommendations for those reasons then it should be held accountable for that.
Other than this I do agree with the proposed considerations.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
The Government could be required to consult with parties that would be affected by the plan to meet the budget. For example, if new

taxes based on the efficiency of new and imported vehicles was to be imposed then it would seem appropriate to consult with
vehicle dealers and importers. The Government must be able to implement the policies it considers are required, but should also

consider how the affected groups could be assisted and their disadvantage mitigated - the "just transition".



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Notes

I think that the adaption provisions are important, but should go into a separate bill - say, the Climate Change Adaption Bill. This would
make the purpose of each bill very clear.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

A key example that comes to mind is local lines companies, who have a lot of vulnerable above-ground infrastructure. More frequent
storms could see more frequent, longer power outages. Requiring these and other organisations to report on these risks would

provide the Government with the information required to consider if further mandated or assisted action should be undertaken.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
I am immensely pleased to see this incredibly important legislation taking shape, and I wish to thank the Minister and MfE for their

hard work.
