Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

          Remuera Station (Ainslie Elizabeth Green)








Reference no: 212

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 There is no point in shifting targets. (we have had nine years of that) Make a target and get on with making sure it gets met. No more
 procrastination-give us all a target now other wise credibility is very much at stake.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 The last government wasted nine precious years so this government needs to make up for that finger twiddling by Groser and

 Bennett. Nine years of wasted consultations I might add.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 I suggest that if more overseas units were to be used, then people will think , and quite rightly , that they are round two of junk
 credits.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 If it looks like the target of being carbon zero is not going to be met. No more free units should be given out as we all know what

 foresters did with theirs .Another rort- bought junk units, converted land to dairying and sold their free units.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 So long as the targets are met, and the budgets are not altered to fit the picture.(I suspect this may happen)



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
Scrap the silly free credits, bite the bullet and get on with it. NZs have had a long time to prepare for this- it will come as no surprise

after Nationals 'do nothing approach" if the Labour Greens approach is much more a head on tackle. Sure federated farmers will moan
and whinge-its their usual dinosaur approach to any little sea change, and unless farmers are legislated in to this , they will do nothing

but bend rules(see mycoplasma bovis drama where a farmer couldn't get a vet to do what he wanted so used one from Waiheke
island.) I think people on low incomes should be considered as costs will increase for them.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
