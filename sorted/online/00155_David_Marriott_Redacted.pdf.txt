Notes
This proposed legislation is highly emotive and not based on facts. To date there is still no evidence that global warming is based on
anthropomorphic emissions. Global warming is a natural phenomena largely driven by natural emissions from eg volcanoes,

subduction gas emissions, seeps from underground reservoirs etc. Having said that, it would be irresponsible not to limit our
footprint on this planet. NASA has carried out studies from orbit of atmospheric CO2 and other 'greenhouse' gas concentrations.

Refer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SgmFa0r04. This demonstrates seasonal high levels of CO2 in the Northern hemisphere
over winter months, much of which is absorbed by vegetation in the Spring and Summer. In the Southern Hemisphere, there are

almost no CO2 emissions. Much of these are from burning low grade coal in Australia, which is currently being reduced. My question
is why does NZ continue to damage our economy in a ineffective response to what is in effect a Northern Hemisphere problem?
