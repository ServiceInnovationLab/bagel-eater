Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Trevor Smith, Trevor Smith Smith








Reference no: 9215

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 Do nothing until the big polluters such as China and the USA agree to do their part.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes
 Do not set targets. Man is not warming the world. Do not waste my tax payers money on this scaremongery.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 Do not set targets.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Yes, change the target to allow carbon emissions.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 Get rid of the idea of targets.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes
 Yes, incoming Governments should be able to remove the targets



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Remove the targets



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
NZ's contribution to world carbon levels is infinitesimal.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
No
Notes

Zero carbon is unattainable. Vegetation absorbs carbon and releases oxygen. Without carbon in the atmosphere vegetation dies,
and we die.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Man can neither create nor destroy carbon. The amount of carbon on this planet is constant. Volcanoes eject more carbon into the

atmosphere than man can even contemplate.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Dismantle the Climate Change Commission. This is a whole industry designed to suck money from the gullible.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes

Dismantle the CCC.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Dismantle the CCC



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
The Zero Carbon Bill should be revoked. It is unattainable and a waste of money.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
Climate change is a function of our solar system, not our carbon emissions. Oil and gas are products of decomposition of vegetation.

The worlds greatest amount of oil and gas is located in the Middle East - but where is the vegetation that produced it.? It is long gone
(the bible tells us this area was desert 2000 years ago before man even lit a match.!!) It disappeared because the Earth's climate
changed without intervention from man.!!




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes
Waste of time and money, this just expands bureaucracy and creates "jobs for the boys."




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Climate change is a function of the geometry of our solar system. Our sun is not stationary. It swings 9 planets around, Jupiter and
Saturn many times bigger than Earth. By Newton's 3rd law there must be a reaction to that force, and that causes the sun into an

orbit of it's own. For all the planets to realign from any point in time, (that is for the sun to complete it's orbit) probably takes
thousands of years. So within this timescale the earth will be closer and further from the sun, creating Iceages and warm periods. We

are currently heading for a warm period. There is nothing we can do.
