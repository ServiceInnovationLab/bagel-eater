Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Wendy Lorraine Donald








Reference no: 10242

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 I have considered for many years that it is too late to make adequate changes, so no delay is paramount.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived

 gases
 Notes
 This is not perfect, but may be achievable.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 I am not happy about carbon trading, as we should be doing our own work.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 Ought not to be extended and it seems unlikely that we will achieve the results earlier.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Maybe imperfect, but targets may be helpful.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Must be very exceptional circumstances only
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

But with great caution, that we can still achieve the goal. e.g. economic matters, or fuel poverty will not matter if the planet has been
made virtually uninhabitable



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

The plans will need to be made public and accompanied by much education of the reasons for the need for severe changes now.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

That the outcome of zero carbon outputs must be achieved by 2050 at the latest. Education of the public of the urgency and
necessity of the changes now.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
More education again and assistance adapting, as this must not be a party political issue, changed by successive governments but

one that people realise we have to have for our future survival.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

Any information may be of use as adaptions are made.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
I have been a Green party member since its inception, as it has been the only party to support changes to avert climate change. I

have a Masters degree in sustainability, with first class honours from the University of Auckland. My thesis was entitled 'What can one
person do? Making changing towards sustainability'. For many years I have lectured to architecture students, potentially big users of

resources. For twelve years I have driven a small (999cc) hybrid car, but only when I could not walk, cycle or use public transport. I am
passionate about our taking action to avert further crises from climate change.
