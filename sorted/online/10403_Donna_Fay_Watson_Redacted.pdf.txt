 Notes
 Globally, Climate Change is already having a huge impact, including measurable aspects such as extreme weather events. New

 Zealand is part of the global community, and although geographically we are a small country, our per capita emissions are high. This
 needs to change. I believe in a net-zero carbon future for New Zealand. In order to work with other nations to achieve a global-
 warming upper limit of 1.5degreesC, we need to be making dramatic reductions in our emissions, and we need to be doing this now,

 not in some vague future. A target for net-zero carbon emissions should be specified in legislation. Emissions from all sources,
 including transport, industrial activity and agriculture, should be included in the target. * I strongly support the immediate creation of a

 Zero Carbon Act. * I recommend that the Government sets a target of Net Zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050 (or
 earlier if possible) * I recommend that New Zealand achieves its targets using domestic emissions reductions. A carbon Fee and
 Dividend system, which sets the price of emitting units of pollution, would encourage fairness, transparency and accountability. * I

 believe it is highly desirable that cross-party support for the target be secured, to avoid the risk of the target being changed for
 political expediency.
