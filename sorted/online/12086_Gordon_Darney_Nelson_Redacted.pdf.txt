Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Gordon Darney Nelson








Reference no: 12086

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived

 gases
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 No
 Notes




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Position
 No

 Notes
Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
Consider what is happening in the rest of the world. Currently the largest emitters do not pay any penalty e.g China, Russia, US, Iran,

Syria, India. It is the same atmosphere and crippling our economy for little improvement is ridiculous. Lift the ban on new hydro electric
schemes which is far less destructive of the environment than the terribly inefficient, visually polluting, bird killing and wasteful wind

generators.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

The reduction of plastic is urgent and a more immediate problem than emissions. We need to do more than removing plastic bags
from shops and supermarket. Milk and water containers should be returned to glass an easily recyclable material. All aluminium and

steel tins must be recycled The supermarkets are more and more pre-wrapping foodstuffs in plastic and this should be discouraged.
These actions would be far more beneficial to the environment than the current emphasis on carbon dioxide reduction. If NZ

succeeds in reducing CO2 emissions our effect on the world will be negligible, on the other hand if we can significantly reduce the
use of plastics this country could be a world leader.
