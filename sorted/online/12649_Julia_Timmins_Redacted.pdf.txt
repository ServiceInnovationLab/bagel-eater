Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
Government needs to work with all those areas that impact on our emissions - transport, agriculture etc. However, also needs to

work with agencies who support those at the lower end of the socio economic scale as any policy decisions will undoubtedly impact
on these people significantly more

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
I cannot see how any of the above can be achieved while the Government sticks to a Budget responsibility ruling. It is irresponsible to
cling to outmoded views of government expenditure when we are facing humanity's biggest crisis. NZ needs to pour money into

research and into policies around Housing and transport. We have a huge number of cars on our road - we need to limit their number
but at the same time invest in public transport across the board. Otherwise, this will impact on families who cannot afford the

alternative. The same goes for our housing. the governement needs to model good building practice by building homes that are
state of the art energy neutral. This will prove socially beneficial immediately and economically sound as the health of our young ones

strengthens. Spend the money!
