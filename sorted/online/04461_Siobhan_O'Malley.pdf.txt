Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Pukeko Pastures (Siobhan O'Malley)








Reference no: 4461

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 As a food producer in NZ, the option to choose the "two baskets" seems attractive, as being more attainable. This should perhaps be
 used as an interim target, even for 2040. However, 30 years is a long time. I personally back Kiwis and especially food and fibre
 producing Kiwis, to come up with the technology and solutions to reach a more audacious goal over a 30 year period. I also think the

 brand advantage for NZ is now, in setting the bigger goal simply as it is the right thing to do.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 We should keep it "in house" in order to both show the world it can be done, and also to make sure that we can impact as much as
 our small nation can on reducing climate change.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 30 years is a long time in the life of technology and scientific understanding of this issue, and the related issues that arise. It would

 not be wise for subsequent governments to alter it because voters ask for it. but there might be circumstances where the target
 becomes meaningless as our understanding of the issues changes.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes
It would be good for the Government to set out plans, however they will not be able to plan for every aspect of this across all

industries. The Government will need to focus on providing long term stability for this purpose to allow industries and individuals to
invest in technology and R&D with confidence.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Given the widely publicised data around the percentage of New Zealand's emissions that sit in the food and fibre producers' hands,

the Government should work with stakeholders from this sector. They also need to make sure that this sector has representation
with the Climate Change Commission. Could the new Primary Sector council appoint a working group to liaise with the CCC on issues

specific to agriculture? The Government needs to be clear with and talking with rural lending and financial institutions about the
stability of purpose and allow them to lend money to farmers who are undertaking development or land use changes in response to
this legislation. The Government needs to work with local regional and district councils whose rural rate payers will be massively

impacted to ask them what support they will need. There are also some key related issues to consider in the rural communities when
the Government considers the impact of this legislation. Farmers and rural businesses will be willing to invest and adapt, so how can

the Government support them? Improved electricity infrastructure and connectivity in rural communities must be a priority to allow the
uptake of technology and to allow R&D to happen in the paddocks and regional centres where this innovation will almost certainly

come from. The electric vehicle uptake for rural people is currently limited by the range of the vehicles and the availability of charging
stations in rural locations. This is the kind of infrastructure that the Government could lead. Government will need to consider how it
can be agile and responsive to rural communities' shifting needs. If land use changes occur, how can the Government rapidly support

shifting rural populations with schools, roads, and access to medical care? If the rate of change is rapid or sudden, how the
Government support the farmers coping with change in their mental health? Can the Government offer support for farmers financially

if a piece of game changing technology becomes available and needs to be, for example, installed on 11,000 dairy farms across the
country to reduce their emissions? This might be grants or low interest loans to fund emissions reducing technology or land use

changes development costs. Can the Government fund industry bodies to disseminate information about practical ways that their
members can reduce their emissions?



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
The desirability of the expertise is paramount. For the Climate Change Commission to have credibility, it will need to be made up of
experts, with cross-industry and scientific knowledge specific to the mission.
Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
As the need arises, subsequent governments can address this.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
Information sharing will be crucial to success. It will be peer pressure organisations to act and adapt when some organisations share

their plans and results. It will also provide collaborative and inspirational content for organisations struggling to adapt - a blueprint for
how others have handled it.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Food and fibre producers in NZ are concerned at a fundamental level with Kaitiakitanga and Legacy. They will want to adopt and adapt
to this legislation. The Government needs to consider how they can best support farmers to make the required changes, without

pushing their costs of production up so much that their customers start buying from higher emitting competitors. There is no point in
putting a sector out of business that is globally an emissions efficient system. The goal should be to support greater levels of
emissions efficiencies in that system. I would also like to highlight the Government's need to prioritise training and capability for

people - we will need scientists and technology developers, but we might also need different primary sector skills or retraining
farmers if we end up with land use changes. Finally, I want to exhort the Government to consider this legislation alongside the full

gambit of environmental issues facing food and fibre producers and on which they have worked hard already. There is no gain if we
sacrifice water quality work or biodiversity in order to reduce emissions. Policy to reduce emissions should ensure it does not have

adverse environmental outcomes in other aspects. Equally, BIOSECURITY needs to be kept front of mind when adopting or
embracing technology for emissions reductions, especially from off-shore.
