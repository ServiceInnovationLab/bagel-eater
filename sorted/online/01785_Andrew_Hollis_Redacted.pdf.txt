Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Andrew Hollis









Reference no: 1785

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Carbon Dioxide - Reducing net carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2050
 Notes
 The government should not set a target yet. The science is not well enough understood




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 Committing to trading carbon internationally is fraught with issues and we should wait until that market is mature before pledging

 public money to that end



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 No

 Notes
 No to this one. Unless each of the 5 year periods can be stopped or changed during the period



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

I suggest a heavy weighting on scientific outcome and testing. An independent scientific body ought to be established to maintain
scientific integrity around climate change



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

No
Notes
Forcing a scientifically based plan on an uncertain time period will cause future issues




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Independent non government related science advice must be taken on this issue to maintain scientific integrity



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
This body should never make independent decisions on policy



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

I suggest weighting the various areas of expertise. For example independent scientific expertise should be sourced and include
BOTH sides of the carbon argument. AND the science advice should be paramount over all other considerations.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No
Notes

Far too many variables for the scope of this bill to cover with any sensibility. The potential to lock into legislation something that may
be wrong is high and goes against the idea of adapting.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes

I would be hesitant to force "sharing" into legislation. This may end up breaching privacy and creating conflict



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Even though it seems clear that the UN and the IPCC believe they have an understanding of the future of the planets climate the
science is not settled. As an MSc in Earth Science and now 28 years of reading and understanding of the sciences behind how our

planet works I am deeply troubled that we are rushing into policy without a reasonable certainty of the science. The precautionary
principle is usually used when there is no real risk of negative affect and in this legislation there is massive risk to our most vulnerable

population. There is no harm in waiting for a year or two to at least have a better understanding of what the future holds. There are
many examples in the literature and in the data, for instance, that show no risk of sealevel reaching even the range of heights
mentioned in the report within 100 years (NZ data used). Nor is there any evidence that substantiates the increase in extreme

weather events beyond normal background events. I note there is no obvious way to verbally submit on this bill but I am happy to
present to the Ministry at any time required post submission date data that shows the hypothesis "Increasing Human caused CO2 in

the atmosphere will cause accelerated sea level rise, increased severity and frequency of extreme weather, acidification of the worlds
oceans or catastrophic melting of the polar ice caps" has already failed and that we may well be embarking on a fools errand. There
are areas of pollution that we do need to remedy but this bill will go no way towards any of that and is likely to cost us as New

Zealanders dearly. How do I make a verbal submission?
