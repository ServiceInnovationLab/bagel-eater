Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Anne Herrington








Reference no: 662

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes
 I don't believe anyone has enough information now to set those targets. With a bit of luck it could involve all parties in parliament to

 get an ongoing commitment to it.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Carbon Dioxide - Reducing net carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2050
 Notes

 I don't feel i (or most people are qualified to answer this at the moment). So I am opting for the weakest measure.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes
 International carbon units haven't worked well as there hasn't been enough safeguards on the quality of them. However provided that

 there are then it would make a lot of sense to make the reductions where it is easiest first. This is a global issue so should be
 handled globally. This could make quite a difference to people in the third world or heavily polluted countries were the fix may be fairly
 cheap to achieve and if supported by the sale of carbon credits it is more likely to happen.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 But there should be a framework put in place at the start so that "changed circumstances" is defined in advance. Look at how the

 Electricity Authority handles low lake levels this has worked well.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes
 More likely to get buy in from all parties if this is included.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

For reasons above and also we are a very small contributor overall and wouldn't want to wreck our economy to maintain a principle if
things change to a significant extent and in a way that wasn't envisioned when the targets were set.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
This consideration "economic circumstances and, in particular, the likely impact of the decision on the economy and the
competitiveness of particular sectors of the economy" should also include wealth transfers and hardship to sectors of the economy

such as farming. Sudden change could be very detrimental and cause considerable hardship to individuals and there would need to
be a significant impact on global emissions for this to be worthwhile. Change shoudl aim to be gradual to enable people to adapt.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
While we want to be world leaders we should also recognise that we are extremely small and that what we do will have little impact

overall so we should not sacrifice industry and people for a lofty goal that may make little overall difference. It is also necessary that
change is seen to be equitable and fair otherwise it is unlikely to be durable and will be undone by future governments and

generations.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

I believe that the two items listed as desirable are in fact essential.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

I couldn't find this?? Maybe I just didn't understand??



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

I only had time to read the summary and some sections where the questions pointed me to it. It is a very quick off the cuff
submission. I suggest that you include farming and business groups in your consultation as well as Iwi, social agencies etc. That is

make sure your consultation is far-reaching and the those groups are well represented by people who do have time to read the
document throughly.
