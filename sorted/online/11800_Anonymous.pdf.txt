Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 A more objective form of GHG accounting is also essential. For more information:

 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes
 Ideally, domestic action is best. If you go to the international markets for cost reasons you need to make sure the market is not

 flooded with cheap credits. For more information on the history of this, please see the below report and Bloomberg article which
 called a crashing of the NZU price in 2010. Idea Carbon, (2010), The future of industrial gas CERs and what it could mean for New

 Zealand: http://www.unep.fr/ozonaction/ozone2climate/Industrial_gas%20_ERs.pdf Bloomberg (2010), ‘Homeless’ UN Emission

 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 To drive investment - policy certainty is a requisite.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
Notes




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The government needs to clearly and concisely identify the policy gap to meet the budgets and avoid policy overlap. Europe made
this mistake in 2008 when setting its 2020 plan, as renewable energy mandates cannibalized demand for EUAs. Please see the

below report I authored with Bryony Worthington, one of the individuals responsible for the UK's climate change act. Sandbag (2015),

(NZ ETS)?

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
