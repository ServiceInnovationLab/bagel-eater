Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Stephanie (Stephanie)




Reference no: 1828

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 Look at the wide variety of options that are simple, small, cost effective. Things like electric bikes, and buses, reducing wasteful
 packaging on all products, working from home initiatives. Encouraging work from home - even one day a week would reduce traffic

 emissions buy 20% overnight. Other initiatives like this would be much more useful.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Notes
 Targets can be set after government changes its attitude to offering 'carrots' to reduce emissions rather than taxing those who can
 least afford it and putting into place initiatives that will impact most on the working poor.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 Strongly opposed to international carbon units.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 Yes, absolutely. No-one can read the future, we can just make guesses of what might happen. Looking back at guesses made in the
 past, I can think of several that were completely wrong and none that were right. So this will just be a guess.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Notes

 It depends on what level the emissions budgets will be set. There is always a 'carrot and stick' in these sorts of things and 'carrots'
 work much better than 'sticks'.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes
 with the best will in the world, it is all guess work and of course a government must be allowed to adjust according to the situation as
 it unfolds.




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 yes, for the same reasons laid out in qu 6.



 Clause
 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Huge consideration must be given to those most affected in their daily lives by the decisions being made - the little man, the
everyday people who are working to make ends meet. It's also exceedingly important that large corporations are not given leeway

and allowed benefits because of lobbying and pressure from them.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

Advisory only.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

Advisory only with absolutely no power. The CCC is not elected by the people, the government is.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Would like to see included those who are aware of the long term effects of environmental damage on weather, rather than focusing
only on emissions.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
No

Notes
sounds like another gravy train



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

I am seriously concerned about the environmental damage being caused by things like deforestation and intensive farming. Things
like deforestation are actually causing weather pattern changes which are impacting us more than emissions. Also, we need to keep
a calm approach to things - extreme weather events are part of the history of our planet and not necessarily caused by emissions.
