 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Today's Parliament cannnot constrain future parliaments in any case.



 Clause

 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
 Notes

 Emissions are from mainly from Agriculture, Transport, Energy, and Industry. For Agriculture, we need more research on methane and
 nitrous oxide reduction. That should include genetic modification techniques, including field trials. (New methods of controlling
 introduced mammals and diseases could also allow regeneration of native forest.) Transport in New Zealand is mostly by cars, trucks,

 and aircraft, which produce far more CO2 than cycling, rail, public transport and shipping. Tax changes to reflect this, and planning
 new housing and infrastructure to suit, should continue. New Zealand's electricity is largely from renewables, but with changing

 climate, our dependance on hydro could be a liability. This summer, Norway's hydro reserves look like being only a third of a normal
 year's. Legislating for 'renewable energy' is not ideal. Our peak electricity demand is in winter, when solar power is lowest, and wind
 usually peaks in spring, when hydro is abundant anyway. Geothermal is constant throughout the year, but limited. Burning biomass is

 classed as 'renewable', but can produce as much or more CO2, in the medium term, as fossil fuels, while requiring vast areas for
 meaningful amounts of energy. Nuclear power is not classed as 'renewable ', but has CO2 emissions on a par with those of wind or
 hydro, while being more reliable than either. Legislation should specify ' low- or zero- emissions energy'. Nuclear could also provide

 process heat for industry - the dairy industry has been burning increasing amounts of coal for milk processing. A prototype nuclear
 reactor powered a dairy factory in Wisconsin during the seventies and eighties, and new designs are being developed. Nuclear

 shipping is also the only plausible way for New Zealand to keep in touch with the rest of the world without burning anything - pity it's
 banned. ( A battery big enough to take a container ship across the Pacific would cost hundreds of millions, and leave no room for
 cargo.) Carbon capture has also been proposed to help balance the carbon budget. I don't believe carbon capture from the smoke

 stack will ever be economic, but we should remain open to other methods of sequestration. Besides forestry, ocean fertilisation with
 iron sulfide or olivine could potentially pull huge amounts of CO2 out of the atmosphere. Methods like this should not be ruled out,

 since current measures have certainly not prevented greenhouse gas levels from increasing faster than ever. It's very important to
 research these things before, not when, we have to deploy them.



 Clause
 14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

 Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

I consider climate change the most important threat to humanity, and I don't think the position of any of the parties in Parliament
reflects this. We need more scientists working on the probable effects, and how to deal with them - and we need to listen to them.
