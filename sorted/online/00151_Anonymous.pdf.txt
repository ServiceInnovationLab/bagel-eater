Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 151

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 We need to act now through legislation and can't delay action in reducing our emissions.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 We need to move to zero emissions by changing farming practices, moving to 100% electric vehicles and renewable energy to
 mitigate climate change. We've delayed action for too long so we need to move fast now to cut out all emissions by 2050.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 We need to focus on planting new forests in New Zealand and moving all vehicles in New Zealand to running on electricity. All of our

 electricity should be renewable and this should happen by closing down the Huntly coal powered station as soon as possible and
 building more wind farms. Our focus should be on reducing domestic emissions as it reduces the risk of buying meaningless carbon

 units that might not result in reducing emissions.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes

 We have delayed taking action for too long already and we have to act now regardless of changing circumstances.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No
 Notes
Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

We need to make sure that those who have the most ability to pay are the ones who fund this act not those one low incomes. We
might need to bring in subsidies for electric vehicles or public transport for people with community services cards and levies on new

polluting vehicles to help meet budgets. Perhaps raise taxes on higher income earners to help fund this Act? Or put more effort into
ensuring multinational companies pay their fair share of taxes to also meet budgets? The Government should work alongside

community organisations and local bodies to carry out this Act.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
