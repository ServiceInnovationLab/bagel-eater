 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 T become more ambitious as escalating CC dictates.



 Clause

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 But they are far too limited and provide inadequate market signals
Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

exposure to climate change risks?

Yes

Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

NZs high transport emissions are an indictment. The NZTA Land Transport studies establish that road transport is paying less than
56% of its costs. This figure ignores the carbon cost, the QUALY cost and most importanly the road corridor costs. The moment
someone steps into their car, their transport weight goes up by at least an order of magntude (ten times). A Nissan leaf weighs a

massive 1.5 tonnes. In addition they presume the right to the space of many cyclists or pedestrians. Worst vehicles presume they
have paid for a road corridor they can use for their exclusive safety, reluctant to truly share the corridor they have never paid for (they

only share part of the pavement costs with rate and tax payers). Until we start pricing for weight and space (congestion) so electric
bikes, quadcycles and active transport have a true cost advantage, we will never get a rational efficient transport system. This will

continue to distort our development with millions of tonnes of concrete and construction poured into unserviceable locations.
Savings in emissions could be made from changing from white flight tribal education with 40% of peak hour traffic being children
driven to school at the cost of their health, development and safety of other children using active transport. This cut emissions far

more and far quicker than slow transition to heavy EV vehicles. It would cost nothing, indeed it would just save money. Leading
society in these directions should be they primary role of the commission.
