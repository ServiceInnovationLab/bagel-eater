Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Reference no: 8386

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 The Government needs to set a clear target. Delay and uncertainty need to be minimised.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 Deep cuts are needed for all greenhouse gases. The sooner this happens the better. It will be more economic in the long term and
 the sooner cuts start the lower overall greenhouse gas quantities will be globally. Also, reducing short-lived greenhouse gases may

 be an essential tool if there is a need to rapidly reduce the gases as critical climate tipping points are approached. Stabilisation would
 not be helpful in this situation.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 The NZ ETS has been abused in the past. This should not be allowed to happen again. We need to make meaningful reductions by

 cutting our domestic emissions.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 Yes, but with provisos. Changes should only be to strengthen the target, not to weaken it. There will be a lot of pressure on
 government to water down the goals, to delay and to do nothing and a future government may be tempted to do this. This must be
 avoided at all costs. We must keep on target or do better. Targets need to be binding.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 This will provide clarity, certainty and a clear message that this is important. People, businesses and communities will be able to make
 decisions as a result.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes
 Reviews should not be used to abuse the process. Once again, they should only be used to strengthen targets, not weaken them.

 This fits with the Paris Agreement requirement to maintain or strengthen goals ever five years.



 Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Once again, the government should have the ability to ratchet up the goals, not to weaken them.



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

Without this it will be too easy for governments which are less committed to the required goals, to procrastinate or pretend to be
doing something when they are actually not.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Important issues to consider are that goals are suitably ambitious and consistent with climate science. They must follow the
requirements of the Paris Agreement. Major cuts need to be made over the next decade, with delay only making it much harder to

arrive at our ultimate goal (zero carbon). Fairness and equity are important issues. Vulnerable communities will need protection, as will
neighbouring Pacific Island nations which will require on-going support as sea levels rise. Fairness also means that all sectors will

need to take part (agriculture should not be exempt). The principles of te Tiriti o Waitangi must be respected.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
I have suggested that there should be no reliance on trading schemes. I feel that New Zealand should be making its contribution by

actually making real cuts in domestic emissions. If there is an ETS, then the Climate Change Commission should have an advisory
role.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
It is important that the Commission has an appropriate range of experts. They should not be political appointees who have an
ideological viewpoint that suits a particular government.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
Adaptation strategies should in no way weaken the commitment to the reduction of greenhouse gases, which must always be the
first priority.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
There is a need to minimise the government's ability to ignore or deviate from the Climate Commission advice. The government must
justify any deviations within a certain time-frame. The Commission's advice needs to have teeth.
