Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
Back to question 3. Planting trees on farms seems to me like a simple but effective option. We already have technology like drones

and mapping software. This will find the most effective places to plant trees to reduce erosion. It will create jobs in the region's.
Planting navites will create habitat for native species. Location is also a big part in what should be planted. I believe forestry should

only be planted a certain distant up river from the ocean. Otherwise heavy regulations on what happens with all the slash and off cuts.
