Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Phillip Schofield








Reference no: 651

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes
 CCC needs to address current farming practices and help to encourage adoption of regenerative farming practices that will both

 improve farm productivity and create opportunities for our farmers to benefit from carbon sequestration to soil and the improvement
 of soil health , plant health and animal health that humus creation will make possible.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived

 gases
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 if we begin a programme of soil regeneration on all of our productive farm land we can quickly sequester enough carbon to soil to

 more than offset NZ's emissions.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes

 would not be necessary if the government has bilateral agreement on our direction



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes

 National is offering cross party or bilateral agreement on emissions targets therefore the ability to change ishould not be necessary
 but it would help with ability to make brave but achievable targets if we were starting to find the targets were not practical or not

 optimistic enough.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
Yes

Notes
similar comments to 6




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
yes but also emphasis should be placed on the role that new technologies around land management will have on reaching targets

and how quickly these (already well known) technologies can be rolled out to our primary industries.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The primary industries in New Zealand are the most important players that can quickly change NZ's emission profile. Therefore MPI,
Landcare, Ag Research and Massey and Lincoln all need to research the soil carbon sequestration opportunities that regenerative

farming practices bring in conjunction with the improvements to soil management, water quality and farm profitability that will accrue
as we manage our natural resources appropriately.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes advisory and monitoring should not be the sole responsibility of Govt.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
It is however essential that there are experts included who understand the role of soil microbiology in soil health and ability of land to

sustain profitable production while also sequestering carbon as long term stable soil carbon or humus.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes
We are already seeing the impacts of climate change and my proposal to concentrate on soil regeneration will also provide resilience

to the increasing frequency of extreme climatic events. It will do this on many levels. e.g. increased soil porosity and soil humus levels
dramatically improves soil water holding capacity. Less impact from dry spells. less flooding in extreme rainfall events, better ability to

cope with temperature extremes etc.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

We need to change the way we think about resource management and farmland management in NZ. Our soil resources and they way
we have changed them during the last 80 years of industrial chemical based farming are part of the reason for the high levels of
greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. Changes are required to the land management methods we use if we want to change the

levels of CO2 in the atmosphere.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

we can only achieve big goals if all are focused in the same direction.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
Thanks for the opportunity to make a submission. Reducing NZ emissions is not hard but many simple changes are required to they

way we use soils and this will meet stern resistance from our agricultural experts who have spent their lives working in the modern
high tech agricultural production systems that ignore the need for healthy soil microbiology. The need to change the impact our

production has on the water, atmosphere, our livelihood and our health is evident and many progressive farmers are already making
big gains in soil health, water quality and soil carbon levels. They are doing this by ignoring the main stream advisors in the industrial

farming businesses and instead are nourishing their soil microbial workforce to cycle nutrients, build humus and improve their
productivity.
