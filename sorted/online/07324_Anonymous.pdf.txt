Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 7324

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes
 New Zealand has plenty of renewable energy options available and should aim to go net negative emissions in the future. This

 renewable energy could give us a global competitive advantage and our products sold as low/zero carbon products. NZ could be a
 leader in truely green products and develop a unique brand around this.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 We may only have a small time window of opportunity to curb the really damaging effects of carbon emissions on the climate,

 otherwise it may be too late, or at best, be less effective. We urgently need to set an ambitious target that sends a strong message
 to the world and encourages other countries to follow. Our previous government has allowed the status quo to continue for the past
 ten years and our emissions have continued to increase. We must act now and we need an ambitious target to help make up for this

 lost time. We can't continue to be like ‘Trump babies’ and put our economy before the survival of the planet. Science has proven
 unequivocally that climate change is undeniable. We have a moral obligation as an educated and civilized nation to follow the UK's
 lead and show we are responsible members of the global community. I am very grateful that the current government is acting so

 quickly on this all important issue. The discussion document quite rightly points out that it actually costs us more the longer we leave
 this, due to very costly damage control. The economic models show there is probably little economic impact if we adopt net zero

 emissions, as opposed to lesser targets, or even doing nothing.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 New Zealand is a renewable energy rich nation and should be taking responsibility for reducing its own emissions by domestic
 reductions (including farming). We should aim to be the ones selling international carbon units to other nations that are not as well
 placed as us.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 No, unless a less ambitious target is set initially and then can later be improved upon. We collectively need to make a firm

 commitment to net zero emissions.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Yes, this is a good longer term timeframe to have in place and goes further out than the term of any one government.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
Position

Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
Notes

Yes, but only if the previous budget is set and second and third budgets follow the advice of the Climate Commission. The
government should not be allowed to deviate substantially from the Climate Commission’s advice and if they do deviate to provide

written public statements of its reasons for doing so. This is a good mechanism for keeping governments on track and accountable.



Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
Yes, but only if it follows the Climate Commissions advice and NZ will still meet its net zero emissions target by 2050.




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
Yes, but I don’t know if the NZ ETS can be made effective, as it has been manipulated by the sharemarket, making the price of carbon

units so low that it is meaningless.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes
Yes, the government does need to set out longer term plans and put policies in place that ensure emission targets are met.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
The government needs to put policies/strategies in place to support marginalized people and especially Maori, as their traditional

communities tend to be coastal and more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. It needs to go even further than that and
address how NZ will respond to climate change refugees. Adopting the Maori world view of looking after the land and water first, then

the people prosper is absolutely right. They also have it right, that we need to work together as a community and help each other
out. Can this sort of thing be made into the core statement of intent of what this bill is about? We need something simple like this that

we can all feel good about - and we need to work together for the common good. New Zealand culture is becoming increasingly
narcissistic. One of my colleagues said in an email, in response to the Zero C Act submissions, that some ‘people are worthless’ and
‘the reasonably well off should not be expected to help those who are suffering.’ I am writing this in response to this attitude, as we

need to move beyond ourselves. There seems to be a lot of apathy, ignorance, or fear in New Zealand about climate change and of
our need to act quickly. Art and culture/religion are important in developing eco literacy and helping to get ’buy-in’ from the public.

Education about climate change needs to happen in schools, in workplaces, churches, other groups. This issue is way bigger than
Health & Safety, so workplaces need to be putting these things into our performance reviews as compulsory objectives, as they are

now doing with Health & Safety. Workplaces should be rewarded for their contribution for meeting emissions targets. Workers
effected by the transition away from fossil fuel industries should be supported into other jobs. Local government should be making

plans around resiliency, including financial resilience, as climate change will put more pressure on limited resources. Local
governments tend to be taking on increasing debt, which is leaving communities vulnerable. Science and technology is our main
hope for mitigating climate change and helping us to adapt. Commercialising science has resulted in less than half of the funding for

science being utilized for doing science and the rest goes on administration. This also forces the focus to be commercially driven,
rather than research driven. Science is now seen as a commodity, to make money from, rather than a longer term investment in NZs

future development



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

This works in the UK and an independent advisory body helps keep governments accountable and on track



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

The sharemarket manipulates any scheme like the NZ ETS to meet its own ends and the price of carbon units has been made so
low, that they are meaningless. A better system maybe to introduce a global carbon tax on every product that uses fossil fuels in its
production.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Yes, the Climate Commission must be made up of independent, unbiased experts as proposed. The arts and culture should be

specified under community engagement and communications. Scientific expertise should be well represented in the Climate
Commission.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes, this is a very important issue and we definitely need plans and policies in place to help us to adapt to climate change.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes, but also include how we will respond to climate refugees and provide mechanisms to educate/engage New Zealanders, to help
them transition away from fossil fuels. Change to a sustainable model for the economy, such as a sufficiency economy? Corporate

structures in organisations are taking a disproportionate amount of the wealth and this is contributing to the income gap in NZ, which
is having negative impacts on New Zealand, such as child poverty and creating the working poor, who don’t receive a living wage.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
Notes

Yes, the more information we have the better we can respond to risks/impacts and track how well we are doing.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Thank you all for your very hard work at getting this submission and detailed discussion document prepared. It is a very positive move
in the right direction and gives me hope for the future. I trust you will find overwhelming support from parliament, NZ and the world for
doing this.
