Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill








Reference no: 2407


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 We should aim for a negative level of long-lived gases. New Zealand should have at least the forestry potential to pursue this goal,
 and may well be a great place for marine permaculture as well. I also support a science-based approach to ensure we have the most
 impactful ways of reducing emissions.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Carbon Dioxide - Reducing net carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes
 I would like to seriously qualify my answer - it is not clear that any present international units would truly meet strong environmental

 safeguards. Using international credits should come with commensurate increases in ambition of targets (eg looking to negative
 emissions). The New Zealand government should itself be able to verify the credibility of any international units.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 Any change should have to be by new legislative change - I read this as allowing an alteration by the Minister alone. If changes are

 allowed, the criteria for this should be clearly set out as only including major changes in scientific knowledge or international
 agreements. Economic changes should not be enough - this would undermine the credibility of the target.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Notes
I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should take the following factors into consideration when advising on and

setting budgets: • scientific knowledge regarding climate change • technology relevant to climate change • economic
circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the

economy • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on taxation, public spending and public borrowing • social
circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel poverty • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy

supplies and the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
This is absolutely critical, otherwise the obligations to meet targets are avoidable. For most people, the actual policies required to
meet targets will mean the most. I also believe the Act should include a clear accountability mechanism where plans are set out that

will not meet budgets. I would support an option that created a statutory framework for judicial review of plans. This could either be
open review allowing judicial review of plans that will not meet targets (and therefore fail to meet the government's obligations), or

otherwise review if the government cannot justify a deviation from the recommendations of the Climate Change Commission.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable,
and reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi. The government should specifically have to consider the longer-term implications of

the plans, so that it has to justify any situation where it is relying on later emissions reductions rather than sooner. It should also have
to clearly specify exact emissions reductions from policies in the plan, so that it is clear that the plan meets the budget.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
I agree with the following collective expertise: • climate change policy (including emissions trading) • resource economics and

impacts (including social impacts, labour markets and distribution) • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori
interests • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like
planning, insurance and local government • risk management • engineering and/or infrastructure • community engagement and

communications. • business competitiveness • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology development system.
I think expertise in public health is also important. Knowledge of agriculture could also be useful.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes
Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance is required in terms of how local councils are involved: • a
national climate change risk assessment • a national adaptation plan • regular review of progress towards implementing the national

adaptation plan • an adaptation reporting power



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

I am a qualified New Zealand lawyer with a Masters Degree in Environmental and Energy Law from New York University. I am 27 years
old and will see substantial impacts of climate change in my lifetime. I think it is important that in addition to setting targets and plans,

New Zealand indicates its real present commitment to taking action on climate change, by introducing a functional price on carbon. A
Zero Carbon Act could be passed to include a set of current policies to help reduce emissions straight away, and the credibility of the

law would be boosted if we saw action being taken right away.
