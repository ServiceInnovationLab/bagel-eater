Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill











Reference no: 2546

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes
 Climate is too serious an issue to delay action on. We need to take far reaching and rapid action now to address this.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 We need to take rapid and drastic action to address climate change. This means moving our electricity generation to 100%

 carboNZero electricity. Switching our transport fleet to electric vehicles and low carbon forms of transport. We need to incorporate
 agriculture and massively reduce our dairy herd. Dairy is particularly bad in that as well as CH4 emissions, Dairy negatively effects the

 water quality of our rivers and recent information has demonstrated that Fontera are sourcing Palm Kernel from the destruction of
 rainforest in Indonesia.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 It makes sense that the reforestation occurs in New Zealand. In this way we will see the benefits from our actions to reduce our
 emissions. We should aim for 100% of our electricity to be produced from carboNZero generation. We need to adopt all the available

 technology to address this problem. We need to be able to respond rapidly with the best technology available. For example, the
 electrification of our transport and the reduction of intensive farming practices. All sectors of the economy have opportunities to
 reduce their carbon emissions and these need to be incentivised.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 It should only be allowed to be revised to enforce a stricter target. With feedback mechanisms in place with the permafrost melting in
 the Arctic we are rapidly running out of time to be able to slow down or reverse the impacts of climate change.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Only if they a strict enough to result in positive change.




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes
 The budget should be able to be moved but only in a positive direction. We cannot afford to delay addressing this climate change.
Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

The budget should be able to be moved but only in a positive direction. We cannot afford to delay addressing this climate change.



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
We need to incorporate Dairy into the equation. We need to immediately stop the expansion of dairy due to its negative impact on the

local and global climate. This will be difficult as there will be considerable pressure to keep business as usual even though it is
destructive to the environment.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
We need to monitor our progress and put in place legislation which holds the government accountable to its progress towards

meeting these goals.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes
The NZ ETS has not worked and the only way for it to work is to give it teeth. The ETS should purchase all its credits from NZ certified

programmes.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes

This is inevitable. It will be helpful to cost in the effect of climate change events on the economy. It will add emphasis to addressing
the problem.
Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

I agree with the proposed functions



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

I am concerned that the Zero Carbon Act will not be resilient against powerful lobby groups. The existing oil and gas sector, the dairy
industry, farming in general, the automotive industry and the big players in the electricity sector will all try to water down and slow

down the necessary action that we need to take. I am also concerned that international trade agreements may also slow down
progress. It is important that the positive opportunities that arise from addressing climate change and the moral obligation to do so

are highlighted. If we delay action it will be far more expensive and we will be less likely to succeed. I believe that all effort needs to be
done to get agreement across all sectors of business and the community if this is going to work.
