Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Wendy John








Reference no: 11607

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 I support a 2050 target, but believe the majority of the emission cuts should be achieved in a shorter period - aiming for 2040. New
 Zealand has a poor, historical record with regards to emissions and needs to make every effort to achieve this goal.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 I also support taking a science-based approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible: we should

 aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. However, the period should be
 shortened - cuts should be achieved in a shorter period - aiming for 2040.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 I support the ‘firewall’ principle, that New Zealand’s emission reduction targets must be achieved by actual cuts in our own

 emissions, and not through the purchase of overseas carbon credits or an over-reliance on forests as carbon sinks.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 Only in a more ambitious direction and under stated provisions, such as scientific advances, changes in international law or
 unforeseen climate changes (tipping points reached). Any revision should require input from the Climate Commission.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that 3 are in effect at all times. However, New Zealand should adopt the

 most progressive budget regime possible. There is no time to waste.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes
 The third emissions budget should only be able to be changed if required to achieve the goal of Zero Carbon by 2050, or, preferably
 2040.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
Emissions budgets should not be altered in response to “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty. However,

the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in scientific understanding or international agreements should be permitted.



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should include the following factors when advising on and setting budgets:

• scientific knowledge regarding climate change • technology relevant to climate change • global leadership, including international
equity




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes

The Zero Carbon Act must require the Government to set and public plans to stay within budget as rapidly as feasible, within a set
time limit that is certainly less than 12 months.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Time is of the essence. The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be comprehensive, fair and just, cost-

effective, environmentally sustainable and reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

The Commission should not be a decision-making body. However, the Government should be legally required to consider and
formally respond to the Commission’s advice, and to provide an explanation if they do not act on it.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
It should not be the role of the CCC to make decisions on the number of units available.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
I agree with the following collective expertise: • climate change policy (including emissions trading) • resource economics and
impacts (including environmental, social, labour markets and distribution) • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori

interests • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori • experience with addressing adaptation challenges such
as planning, insurance and local government • risk management • engineering and/or infrastructure • community engagement and

communications • business competitiveness • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology development
systems.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

The Government needs to prepare a national climate risk assessment and produce an adaptation programme to address any
identified risks.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance is required in terms of how local councils are involved: • a
national climate change risk assessment • a national adaptation plan • regular review of progress towards implementing the national

adaptation plan



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
Notes

A targeted adaptation reporting power could start with voluntary reporting in the first year, that could be shared, and require
compulsory reporting in subsequent years.




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

There needs to be more emphasis on the effects on the natural environment and biodiversity, and how any further adverse effects
can be avoided.
