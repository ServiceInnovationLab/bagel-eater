Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill






Reference no: 1816

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 The Government should set no target and withdraw from the "Paris Climate Accord"



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes
 No target is best for NZ. The Government should withdraw from the "Paris Climate Accord"



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 The Government should set no target and withdraw from the "Paris Climate Accord"



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Notes
 The Government should not enact a "Zero Carbon Bill" and withdraw from the "Paris Climate Accord"



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Notes

 The Government should set no emissions budget and withdraw from the "Paris Climate Accord"



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes

 The Government should set no emissions budget and withdraw from the "Paris Climate Accord"



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes

 The Government should set no emissions budget and withdraw from the "Paris Climate Accord"



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Notes
 The Government should not have a Climate Change Commission and withdraw from the "Paris Climate Accord"



 Clause

 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Notes

 The Government should not enact a "Zero Carbon Bill" and withdraw from the "Paris Climate Accord"



 Clause
 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

 Notes
The impacts of "Climate Change" are vastly over-hyped - NZ as a whole contributes virtually nothing in the way of Emissions - the Govt

should consider this before pushing more cost onto New Zealanders.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

No, never a good idea to copy UK policies , especially around Global warming / Climate change We should follow the US example and
withdraw from the "Paris Climate Accord"



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Notes
No role at all. and the ETS should be repealed / disbanded




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
No, no "Commissioners" required. If you are serious about "Carbon Emissions" then you only need engineers, economists and

scientists - everybody else, especially Cultural Groups and Social Justice advocates are superfluous, this indicates the Commission is
not about solving this "science" problem - it's about empire building for career troughers. Anyway it's never a good idea to copy UK
policies , especially around Global warming / Climate change We should follow the US example and withdraw from the "Paris Climate

Accord"



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Notes

The Government should not enact a "Zero Carbon Bill" and withdraw from the "Paris Climate Accord"



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes
There is nothing in the document regarding investigating and investing in alternative technological solutions (eg: Nuclear Power)

which would give the most resilience to our economy while meeting the proposed Carbon Zero target



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
No
Notes

No. no more compliance frameworks administered by highly paid government troughers please



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
Your reports notes "The costs from climate change are already high and growing." So why further penalize New Zealanders (and it will

be mostly the poorest) to impress offshore unelected bureaucrats ? Why are you turning up the fear? NZ already uses mostly
renewable energy, has perhaps the worlds most efficient farming practices and an emissions output so low as to be negligible in

impact on the atmosphere. (and don't quote per-capita emissions output - those figures are a fiction- only total emissions count IF
you are serious about solving this over hyped issue - working on a per-captia basis suggests the issue is not at all pressing)

Fortunately, the modeled impacts of "Climate Change" are vastly over-hyped - and we do have far more pressing issues to deal with in
NZ right now. The Government should instead commit the billions that will be wasted in Climate Mitigation & Zero Carbon Target

administration to NZ' s Children's health, safety and education. All we have to do to combat Climate Change is take off the jersey and
walk inland slowly.
