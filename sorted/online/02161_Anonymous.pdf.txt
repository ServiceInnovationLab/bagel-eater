Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 2161

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 This is urgent.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 We need to move urgently to protect and preserve, as well as improve on the safety and well-being of our earth and each-other. This
 can't be achieved with any significance by selective intervention such as focusing on one sole part of the emission problem.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 No need to borrow, reduction is the aim all round. If I have understood this correctly.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Yes but only to move the date closer.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes

 Yes but please can there be some assurance that an incoming government cannot increase allowances in order for
 companies/corporations to profit.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Exceptional would have to be explicitly explained...
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes but please don't let the economy take precedence over action on emissions. Obviously the economy needs to be one of the
things taken into consideration, but not at the expense of global health and safety. Short term economic consideration should not

outweigh long term economic and health and disaster related costs of climate change and damage to our environment.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
NOW PLEASE



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
As a student nurse I can see that the health system needs to be enabled to carry out its functions while sticking to our apparent

principle of environmental sustainability. Not only enabled, but loudly encouraged and regulated. Ora Taiao is a worthwhile
organisation to consult on this.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes
Only an independent commission focused primarily on climate change can create effective policy. I don't believe we should be trading

in toxic substances at all.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Please listen to the people of Aotearoa. I am trying to parent my child, nurse sick patients and follow my own dreams, while every day
my heart is breaking when fearing for the health of my community, the condition of our beautiful and precious planet and the state of

our sacred waters. I work very hard, and for long hours and then am reduced to tears while walking down the aisles of the
supermarket. Because I feel guilty for every single product I buy that I cannot afford/do not have the time to source elsewhere, that
may be contributing to the demise of our environment. I am tired of plastic and oil being the ruling powers of our times. It is

exhausting, when you care, to be faced with endless arguments about economics, convenience, capital and freedom to profit. These
things will never matter as much as our air, land and water. The health of our souls, minds and bodies. No wonder we are in a state of

mental crisis. We cannot keep ignoring this problem. Thank you so much for creating this stepping stone, and may it be honoured
with enough detail and integrity to prevent it becoming lip service and box ticking.
