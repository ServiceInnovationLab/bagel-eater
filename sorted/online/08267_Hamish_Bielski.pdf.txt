Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Hamish Bielski,










Reference no: 8267


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Farmers who build soil, and stop soil erosion and excessive tillage. Renewable resources like wool should be used. Synthetic carpet

in KiwiBuild homes is hypocrisy using fossil fuel synthetic carpets!



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Soil Carbon must be part of the equation. Cropping farms are depleting carbon yet more of this is promoted.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Paris Accord has increase of soil organic matter 0.4%/year which some European countries have adopted. Where our soils are
depleted, this should also be the aim. Soil is the foundation.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Healthy soil can absorb methane via Methantrophs. More works needs to be done here but be very careful on taxing methane from
ruminants. Science will tell us that ruminants are vital to rebuilding topsoil/OM on cropping farms, and storing high levels of carbon on

pasture land. Dung Beetles are crucial for reducing N2O and maybe even methane. Bare soil ie winter cropping is very bad, diverse
forages and better grazing practises without N fertilser is the future. We Extracting fossil fuels are the main problem, so we should be
promoting natural products like wool, hemp etc. We need to use Regenarative farming priniclples that not only improve the

environment, but demand a greater premium of product prices is the future. Synthetic proteins cannot claim that they can improve
our natural resources. Farming is not the problem, it is how we are farming. Photo's below demonstrate some of our different forages

for stock, and harvesting wheat while having N fixing clover underneath and keeps a live plant growing that protects the soil and
requires no N fertilser.
