Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Louise McNally








Reference no: 218

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes
 Planting trees is not enough. Until we stop pandering to animal agriculture no real change is going to come about. Dairy and meat
 farming is destroying our environment, wasting resources and taxpayer money. Until we address the fact that we need to

 revolutionise our lifestyles and approach to animal use no positive change will happen. Iâ€™m tired of the Ministry for Environment
 declaring that farming is 48% of our gas emissions and then never addressing ways to tackle this. Step up!



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 No

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes



 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

 Notes
 Work with farmers. Work with producers of alternative meats and organic plant products that are better suited to NZ climate and a
 more efficient, clean use of resources.



 Clause

 11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
