Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Julian Seidenberg








Reference no: 598

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 Setting a goal to set a target is silly. That's just kicking the can down the road.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived

 gases
 Notes
 Short lived gases like methane will have a much quicker impact on the climate and should be prioritised over carbon. Definitely don't

 ignore short lived cases and focus exclusively on carbon, just because carbon has all the media attention.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 Carbon trading is far too likely to result in cheating.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 But only in exceptional circumstances.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes
 Companies should be able to have some ability to plan for the changes without the risk that they might be changed by a new
 government.




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Yes, although the government shouldn't just be able to declare something to be "exceptional circumstances". So, e.g. if the economy
takes a hit, that shouldn't be a licensing to change the budget. Only truly exceptional circumstances should allow a change, and

there should be a list of examples of such circumstances written into the legisation.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes, although the potentially disastrous long term consequences of climate change should be weight up against all these other
factors.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The huge impact of animal agriculture on climate change is mostly overlooked.

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/21/giving-up-beef-reduce-carbon-footprint-more-than-cars This is, of course,
hugely unpopular as most people in New Zealand consume meat and a large portion of the NZ economy is based on raising

livestock. However, the reality of the situation is that a reduction in meat production and consumption will have the biggest short term
impact on climate change, so it would be foolish and irresponsible for the government to ignore this. A potential solution would be to
put in place measures to transition the NZ economy to be more focused on technology development and high-value organic

vegetable production. The same fields were cows currently live could be converted to vegetable farms. This might even increase the
farmers' revenue as there is a large international trend towards vegetarianism: http://www.roymorgan.com/findings/6663-vegetarians-

on-the-rise-in-new-zealand-june-2015-201602080028 A side-benefit of this kind of economic shift could be an improvement in the
health of New Zealanders. That is, consuming more vegetables leading to less heart diseases, for example.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
With the USA and China not doing much to counter climate change, New Zealand alone can't have much impact. Adaption is a must.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Very much so.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Some specific policies to consider: - Subsidies and tax incentives to encourage renewable power and electric vehicle (including
ebikes) - Increased tariffs and tax on animal products and discounts on vegetable products - Investing in a smart grid that can handle

distributed power production - Setting goals to shift New Zealand's economy to be more sustainable - Aiming to reach carbon zero
earlier than 2050
