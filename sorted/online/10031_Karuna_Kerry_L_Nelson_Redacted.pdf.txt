Reference no: 10031

Submitter Type:   Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes
 It is because they farm out their real workers to private "organisations" contractors. And the real workers such as cleaners and
 maintenance et al staff suffer low income low self esteem no real job security or satisfaction while councillors and other elite sit in
 their neat little offices and go home to their secure ivory towers. The pyramid is upside down! !!! Look for Maslow's "Hierarchy of

 Needs" for what everyone should have then Google Vygotsky's "Scaffolding "
