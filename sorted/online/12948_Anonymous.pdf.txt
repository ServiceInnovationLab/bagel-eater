Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

The government should first provide irrefutable proof that man made production of carbon dioxide in New Zealand is harmful to
humans or life forms in New Zealand before taking any actions that can interfere with the economy or lifestyles of New Zealanders.
We have already seen the government wipe potentially billions of dollars from the New Zealand economy by decreeing that there will

be no future oil and gas exploration which will have the end result of increasing global greenhouse gas emissions. I do not consent to
MFE publishing my name on their website.
