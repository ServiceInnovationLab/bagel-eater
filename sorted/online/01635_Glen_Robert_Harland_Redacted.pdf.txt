Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Reference no: 1635

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 Ban the burning of wood for domestic heating! It is extremely toxic and full of group 1 carcinogens. It is the biggest source of carbon
 in NZ by far. Subsidize heat pumps again. Overall, Biomass Burning is the largest source of primary fine carbonaceous particles and

 the second largest source of trace gases in the global atmosphere (Bond et al., 2004; Andreae and Merlet, 2001; Forster et al.,
 2007; Guenther et al., 2006) The whole carbon neutral thing is a lie. Think about it for a minute. You are blasting all the carbon from a
 tree into the air in 5 minutes when that tree would otherwise be absorbing carbon from fossil fuels for the next 100 years. Then you

 plant another tree, which takes at least 25 years to start absorbing the same carbon as the one you cut down. But wait, the
 replacement tree is cut down at 25 years old. While all this is going on trees are not able to die naturally and release soil organic
 carbon back into the soil, which new trees need to grow. Eventually the soil is completely stripped of soil organic carbon, which is

 now in the atmosphere. How is that either carbon neutral or sustainable?



 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

 Position
 Yes

 Clause
 Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

 Stop cutting trees down and burning them and there would be zero net carbon overnight.
