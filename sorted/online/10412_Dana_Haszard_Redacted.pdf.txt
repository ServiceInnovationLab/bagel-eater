Reference no: 10412

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes
 While option 2 poses more challenges to agriculture than option 1 poses under present practices and conditions, it is likely that in
 the thirty year time frame advances in science and technology will make the option to stabilize emissions of short-lived gases more

 realistic than it might appear in the shorter term. The mood of the times both nationally and internationally requires governments to
 be seen to be taking action. However, particularly at the domestic level, this adjustment needs to be seen as necessary and realistic.

 Achieving such a goal must be managed in a context of helping the productive sector to adapt, and operate within the defined
 parameters, rather than being seen to do the 'right thing' by international standards and disregarding the challenges these changes
 pose for the productive sector.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 The proposed 2050 target is to encourage NZ to develop strategies to continue to devleop and maintain a lifestyle and economy that
 respects and protects the environment, both domestically and internationally.. While purchasing overseas carbon units provides am
 option to help acheive the zero emissions target on paper, it would be seem preferable that they be seen as a option to satisfy

 internationally imposed specific targets on exports and to stay on target while science and technology work towards solutions to
 challenges such as fuel poverty, at any given time, rather than as an intrinsic part of achieving the target..



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The Government should be mindful that on-going solutions and adaptations will come from within many industries as they work to
reduce emissions. If not represented on the Climate Change Commission, it would be important for the Government to have access

to the expertise of those with knowledge of public and private innovations and technology development systems, particularly in the
primary production sector.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
With the inclusion of tjhe 'Desirable, but non -essential, expertise,' in particular of those with 'knowledge of the public and private

innovation and techniology development system.'



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
The productive sector is a major contributor to the country's economy, and to the food supply both domestically and internationlally.

Every aspect of the expertise suggessted for the Cliimate Change Commission is to be found in the productive sector along with
often generations of understanding and respect for the environment. It is hoped that the sector is recognised as a valuable

reference resource for establishing climate change pollices and emissions targets.
