Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Change for Good Consulting (Philip James McKenzie)








Reference no: 12148

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 Enshrining a target in legislation ensures we all have something to aim for and can begin innovation, system change and adaption.
 The alternative of waiting for some later target is that we all vacillate until something is firmed up, or political change waters down our

 targets.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes
 Clearly there are differences in the way short and long lived gases are generated and behave. By splitting them it means certain

 sectors like agriculture have an incentive to innovate to counteract the short lived gases like methane, but, are not penalised in the
 longer term.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes
 I believe there will need to be a mix at the end of the day, and not constraining ourselves to domestic only reduction allows some

 flexibility and innovation to be part of that reduction. This won't absolve our need to move strongly and quickly domestically,
 particularly as the price of units is likely to grow



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 No

 Notes



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Yes, this will help keep us all on target and avoid procrastination as businesses



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes, this seems to be an appropriate mix of advice and monitoring



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes, strongly agree, without targets we won't progress strongly and consistently enough.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Wide consultation will be required, particularly to set plans allowing for innovations that have or are occurring and also to allow for
previously unforeseen or market reactions and consequences, that mean our targets and now too high or too low.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes, they seem appropriate



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes, I agree that they have sector group expertise rather than be stakeholder representatives. Stakeholder voices are important, but
can be catered for in consultative groups that the Commissioners interact with on a periodic basis. This avoids 'captured interest' by
any particular sector.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes

Yes, in the sense that adaptation will be a key part of meeting reduction targets and will greatly help alignment across all agencies



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

Yes, agree with all of those



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes, this will help transparency and our understanding of the risks and opportunities
