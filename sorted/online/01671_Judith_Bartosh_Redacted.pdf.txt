Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Mrs. (Judith Bartosh)









Reference no: 1671

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes

 There should not be budgets. Carbon dioxide is not a pollutant



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Notes

 There should NOT be a zero carbon bill.



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause
 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
 Notes

 Scientists who understand the "real science". How is the earth affected by sun spots? What is the role of the oceans in climate
 change? What is the role of volcanic activity on land and under the ocean on climate change? How do we accurately measure
 worldwide temperature? None of these things are taken into account by the mathematical models used to predict climate change.

 This is why they are so inaccurate. Al Gore's Hockey stick is a good example. There was no warming from 2000-2014 but carbon
 dioxide levels continued to increase. Why?. We need good science before we spend billions of dollars.



 Clause

 13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
 Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes

 This is a waste of money until we understand the science and find out why and how the earth is warming.



 Clause
 14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 There should be no Zero carbon bill but we need to adapt to the inevitable climate change



 Clause
 15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

 functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

 exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

This document presupposes that man made Carbon dioxide emissions are the major cause of global warning. Science does not
support this. Action required. Review the "real science" (not mathematical models based on very limited data and are continually

proven wrong by new data) which seems to indicate carbon dioxide levels increase after global warming, not cause it. Have a plan for
NZ to adapt to climate change, address pollution in the form of carbon particles and other gases in the air, swimmable rivers, clean

harbours, plastics recycling, making NZ organic. Carbon dioxide is a colourless odourless gas we all breathe out, not a pollutant. New
Zealand should be leading the world in questioning the science.
