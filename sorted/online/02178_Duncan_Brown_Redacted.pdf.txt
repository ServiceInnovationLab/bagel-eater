Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

TDHB (Duncan Brown)










Reference no: 2178


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 methane itself may be short lived but it is converted in the atmosphere to other greenhouse gases which live longer




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
that cost is no longer the primary concern. Balancing cost with sustainability is of course important but at least in the short term,

capital investment is required. It may be more expensive in the short term but hopefully this investment will pay back in the longer
term. It requires a long sighted approach from politicians, the media and the public.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
This is important but will require additional resources and may be too much for a single organisation to take on




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

In healthcare we know from studies that around 60% of our environmental impact and carbon footprint is from procurement. I am
almost certain that most households around the country are the same. It is easy to measure CO2e from our transport, energy etc -

these are the low lying fruits, but unfortunately only account for (at best) half of our emissions. Our clothes, chemicals, household
appliances, the things we consume of a daily basis without thinking probably make up the other half (or 2/3) of our true

environmental impact. As most of these things in NZ are imported from elsewhere but 'consumed' in NZ we need to make sure that
these are included in our calculations. I do not think currently that they are (other than perhaps their transport. This is depressing for
2 reasons. 1 - our job already seems daunting enough, the realisation that our CO2e is perhaps twice as large as we think makes the

task so much bigger. 2 measuring this is near impossible, it will require a full lifecycle analysis of all products imported to NZ. IF we are
serious about being truely carbon neutral rather that fudging the numbers on paper then this is what we NEED to do. We must

include healthcare in our calculations. Anaesthetic waste gasses make up a significant proportion of healthcare CO2e but are not
included in the government calculations. The anaesthetic gases from our 6 theirs last year were equivalent to the annual emissions

from 70 family cars... Finally I feel strongly that 'sustainability' is the key. sometimes focusing only on one strand of this (carbon
neutrality) can be detrimental to the environment in a number of other ways and NOT be sustainable. Geothermal electricity and its
impact of fresh water ways is a good example of this. We need to aggressively chase down our carbon targets but we also need to

focus on the wider issues of 'sustainability' for our country and our planet.
