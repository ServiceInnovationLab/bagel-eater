Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Christopher John Fidoe






Reference no: 1770


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes

 The whole hypothesis is faulty - to reduce co2 emissions to zero would require the whole human and animal population of earth to
 be eradicated and all the volcanoes to be capped and made extinct.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes
 Best target none of above. Every time politics gets involved the situation gets worse through unforeseen circumstances.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 The only target worth pursuing is zero pollution in the environment - IE sewage on the beaches and plastic waste.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 No
 Notes




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

 The economy and peoples standard of living.



 Clause
 11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

 its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Just another expensive level of bureaucracy.

(NZ ETS)?

Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
We are a carbon based lifeform, so the zero carbon policy is totally cretinous and farcical.
