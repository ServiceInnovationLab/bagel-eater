Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Reference no: 2427

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 It should NOT set a target. Climate is, and always has, changed. Any supposed anthropogenic C emissions are attributable ONLY to

 exhaust gas emissions from fossil-fuel burning in internal combustion engines. The rest of the supposed C emissions are a figment
 of the Green's red-tinged imagination.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Notes
 It should NOT set a target. Climate change is a figment of the Green's red-tinged imagination.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 New forest planting only has a temporary effect on CO2 levels (once a climax community is reached NO net sequestering of C occurs)
 - no difference from sequestering C in soil on a farm.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Notes
 No



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes
 Someday a government will understand that this and other similar governments have been hoodwinked ...



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Someday a government will understand that this and other similar governments have been hoodwinked ...



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
No
Notes

Someday a government will understand that this and other similar governments have been hoodwinked ...



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

You need to talk to people who understand the C cycle. Agriculture has NO NET carbon emissions. If anything, increasing soil depths
on farms is C sequestration.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Notes

The NZ ETS is ludicrous. Forest planting only has a temporary effect on CO2 levels (once a climax community is reached NO net
sequestering of C occurs) - no difference from sequestering C in soil on a farm. So in the end the NZ ETS will achieve nothing to

reduce C levels in the atmosphere.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

The experts I listen to seem to be blissfully (or deliberately?) ignorant of the C cycle and seem to have a pre-set agenda on what is
causing increasing C levles.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes

Do you know that climate change MUST always occur? Every time a cloud covers the sun we have climate change.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

NOTHING can adapt to CHANGE. By definition, if something changes, as soon as you adapt to the change things have changed so
you are behind again.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
No
Notes

NOTHING can adapt to CHANGE. By definition, if something changes, as soon as you adapt to the change things have changed so
you are behind again.
Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
I am appalled at the misinformation that surrounds 'climate change'. Those who promulgate the illusion most are those who know
least about it - ie the Green Party. I have looked at their academic credentials - note one Green MP has any science background at all.

Those scientists who claim to know about climate change tend to cherry-pick their data because being a climate-change believer is a
guarantee of funding.
