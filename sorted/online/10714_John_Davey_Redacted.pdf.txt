Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

John Davey, John Davey







Reference no: 10714

Submitter Type:   Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 No target set. The climate change is natural , the real issue is the waste and pollution caused by excessive use of plastics, chemicals
 and throw away appliances. The sea has become the worlds sewer.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes
 I am all for planting more trees, but a monoculture of pines is not biodiversity, also any pests that arrive could wipe out much of the
 timber industry relying on one tree species.



 Clause

 Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
 Notes
 Firstly I see the submission form has no place for those opposing this scam. The climate change you are talking about here is

 fraudulent and should be treated as such. The government should be stopping this instead of ripping off its employers. Only a few fat
 cats on the other side of the world are going to benefit from this.
