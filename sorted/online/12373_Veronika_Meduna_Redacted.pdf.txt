Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Veronika Meduna, Veronika Meduna








Reference no: 12373

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes
 I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking an evidence-based
 approach to any effort to reduce emissions to have the biggest possible impact. The goal should be to achieve negative (below zero)

 levels of long-lived gases (carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide) while significantly reducing short-lived gases (methane) to sustainable
 levels.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 This target should be reached by actually reducing our own emissions or offsetting them by newly planted forests, and not by using

 international carbon credits.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 I support a capacity to revise the 2050 target, but ONLY in exceptional circumstances. The purpose of the Zero Carbon Act is to
 provide accountability, certainty and flexibility, which it can only do by setting clear and legally-binding emission reduction targets. A
 range of different policy instruments set up to meet the 2050 target will provide flexibility, particularly in response to any changes in

 technology e.g. a methane vaccine). Any future revision should require input from the Climate Commission and approval by
 Parliament. I do NOT support revision of the 2050 target for economic reasons.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes
 Any new government has the flexibility to introduce different policies to meet the upcoming target.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Only under truly exceptional circumstances, such as an extreme natural disaster.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
I support the Zero Carbon Act having a strict time frame for setting out policy plans, ideally within months after an emission budget

has been set.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Any policy plans to meet emission budgets should be comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and reflect a
commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
I support that the Climate Commission has two main functions: providing expert advice and monitoring progress on achieving the
targets.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

Expertise in public health (in relation to climate change) is missing from the currently proposed list of expertise.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes
Adaptation (preparedness for the impacts of climate change, such as droughts, floods, sea level rise, more concurrent hot days with

impacts on livestock etc) should be part of the Zero Carbon Act.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

The government should be required to prepare a national policy plan to address climate risks.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

A Zero Carbon Act must be just and fair and honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi. It has to ensure a fair transition for workers in industry that will
undergo a downward change and for rural communities whose livelihoods lie in agriculture. The act also needs to avoid passing on

the costs to future generations.
