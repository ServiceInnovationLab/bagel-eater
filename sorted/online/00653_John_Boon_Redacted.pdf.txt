Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

John Boon









Reference no: 653

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes

 It's already too late to consider any other option.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 The other options will still cost us a fortune in the downstream impacts of climate change and introduce massive, unpredictable risks
 of catastrophe. Better to apply more braking now and ensure we are safe later, than try to stop and turn the climate on a sixpence,

 which may well be impossible, later.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 International carbon units have been tried and are a scam, which New Zealanders knowingly subscribe to. Relying on them would be
 to rely on the lowest standard provider in the world that sets the lowest market price. All we would achieve is the illusion and cost of a
 system of failure.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 There may be a change of government and previous governments have been faint hearted or even backtracked on essential

 progress towards climate change. Everything should be done to compel us to stick to our guns or even do better - but not back
 down.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 But only if they meet or exceed the end goal and do not place that in jeopardy.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

We should not allow for a government to back down on the overall target to satisfy the demands of any industry or lobby group. There
should only be able to be trade-offs - so the ultimate goal is attained.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
There's not enough representation from or commitment to alternative energy and micro generation. Active support through

legislation and regulation for micro generation can only help relieve pressure on other aspects of any carbon neutral strategy in a way
that places little burden on public coffers. Where is this directly represented in the make up of the commission?



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
But it seems pretty toothless in the proposed form and will be brushed aside by ministers and ministries that do not have clear
directives to make substantial change to lead the community by example.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
And where they can be sourced from. It should also have a specific mandate to regulate in order to prevent scams and trading in

fraudulent credits: for instance banning credits from countries known to allow fraudulent trading.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Alternative energy as micro generation and smarter consumption (e.g. EVs) needs to be represented by someone who is not in the
thrall of the carbon industry.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes

It's an admission of failure. If that becomes inevitable then another mechanism is needed. Zero Carbon is the fence at the top of the
cliff and should not immediately become the ambulance at the bottom.
Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
I'm involved as a community representative in flood plain management planning. I can attest to the fact that almost nobody in New

Zealand understands the cost NOW of society having to adapt for climate change that is within the bounds of the Paris Accord. For
instance, it will add 16% more flood water volume to our planning for defences. This translates to millions of dollars. If the government
could educate the country about the cost of doing nothing, or the cost in climate change of only doing enough to meet the Paris

Accord - then public attitudes would be very different. People assume doing nothing costs nothing and doing little costs little.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Why is there not more emphasis on changing regulation of the power industry? At best this industry has green-washed whilst
introducing many barriers to entry for micro generation in discriminatory pricing in which those who invest in green power micro
generation are effectively subsidising those who do not. This works against any zero carbon strategy the government may have. The

industry needs re-regulating to ensure a positive contribution and support for those who personally want to help make zero carbon a
reality at their own cost and risk. It's low hanging fruit for the government.
