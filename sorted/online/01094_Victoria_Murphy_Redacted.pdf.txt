Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Victoria Murphy, Victoria Murphy (Victoria Murphy)










Reference no: 1094


Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

 Notes
 You need to work with science based community, including a strong input from the Agricultural sector. The ramifications of planting

 pines all over our regions has not been thought through, look at Tolaga Bay. It will mean rural communities will suffer (most of the
 forestry workers live in Gisborne, NOT from the coast). The following comment taken from the executive summary is also laughable
 "More forestry, in the right places, will improve the health of our birds, fish and plants. It will also improve water quality in our rivers and

 lakes and prevent erosion." Plantation forestry is not the panacea that everybody thinks it is. Plantation forestry needs to have strict
 controls put on it, just like farming, as the degradation of water ways and habitats can be just as bad, if not worse during the harvest

 time. The soil is laid bare for 5-10 years before the next pine takes hold and gives cover. There is a lot of damage that occurs during
 that time. ALso, is their any research into the long term soil health after 2 or more rotations of pine forests? Are we creating vast,
 infertile, monocultural deserts? The question is out if forestry is as sustainable as it claims to be. We need to have more active land

 management from councils. It needs to be on a catchment basis, as every situation is different. And people who have experience in
 the agricultural and forestry fields must be involved and listened too, not just policy makers from the urban areas. This is extremely
 important as this could be an extremely positive move for everybody, if the right people are involved. We certainly do not need to

 widen the urban rural divide, which is fed by mis information and sound bites from the media. Also, the Government need to consider
what already exists in terms of vegetation and trees that are on farms, do the farmers that have been 'good environmentalists' that

have retained native vegetation and planted etc, get punished, whilst a dairy farmer that has previously clear felled their land get
carbon credits if they plant after the set date? A farmer who has actively retained native vegetation should be able to use that to

offset their carbon emissions.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

For any goals set, you must have monitoring, otherwise it is a waste of time.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
What ever is set, it must be based on science, please refer to your document. Any target we set needs to be informed by the best

available climate change science. Nearly half of New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture, which means we
need to pay particular attention to the scientific impact of short-lived gases like methane, which dominate agriculture’s emissions.

SHORT-LIVED AND LONG-LIVED GASES Short-lived gases like methane decay relatively rapidly in the atmosphere. They last for
decades rather than centuries. This means global temperatures can be stabilised without necessarily reducing emissions of these
gases to zero. We also have an opportunity to lower the impact even further by not only stabilising but also, where possible, reducing

short-lived gases from our economy. Long-lived gases like carbon dioxide either need to reduce entirely to zero or at least to the
point where emissions can be balanced out by an equal amount of removals.
