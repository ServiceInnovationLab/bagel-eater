Reference no: 1197

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 Goals need to be as ambitious and specific as possible. It is all too easy for other topics to take higher priority at times (financial
 crises, earthquakes etc) so we need goals which push us to do as much as we can, when we can.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 The world needs to reach net zero emissions ASAP. The global average CO2 concentration is already over 400ppm and rising, up

 from pre-industrial levels of 280ppm. https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-the-world-passed-a-carbon-threshold-400ppm-and-why-it-
 matters We have already seen a global average temperature rise of 1-1.5°C. https://www.climatecentral.org/news/world-flirts-with-

 1.5C-threshold-20260 450ppm is associated with a 2°C global average temperature rise.

 UPDATED%20NOV2012.pdf Even global net zero emissions right now would result in maintaining the 400ppm. There is scientific

 consensus that risk of catastrophic climate change is only mitigated for concentrations below 350ppm. The goal should be to avoid
 catastrophic climate change, and therefore we should aim for net zero, or even negative emissions. I would prefer to set an earlier
 date than 2050, but I will accept 2050. [I tried very hard to avoid putting most of that in all-caps. Kinda proud of myself for holding

 back.]



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 With a low population density, relatively high standard of living and extensive renewable energy resources, New Zealand has more
 opportunity than most to achieve net zero emissions in the near future. New Zealand should lead the world, and potentially sell

 International Carbon Units, rather than buying from overseas.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Yes, if the scientific consensus changes, or other dramatic events intervene. Short term humanitarian emergencies should always
 have higher priority. I expect that the scientific consensus will only get more dramatic, as it has done over the last 30 years. In this
 case, the target may have to be adjusted to become more ambitious.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Instead of a step change every 5 years, it may make sense to have a steadily decreasing annual budget. If a budget is not achieved,
 then the following budget should be reduced to compensate. i.e. the total integrated emissions until 2050 should stay constant. We

 should avoid the natural inclination to make future targets easier based on previous failure to meet targets. (The proposal regarding
 "banking or borrowing from one emissions budget to the next" sounds like a similar principle.) I would support aligning the emissions
 budget with the ETS cap and trade system. My understanding is that a carbon tax would be even more effective than ETS, but also

 that this is not up for debate at the moment.
Clause
6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

Position
Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
Notes

The reality of politics suggests that each incoming government can change as much as they like. The barrier to change should be
fairly high, but changes in either direction may be good policy for a given set of circumstances.




Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Same as my comment to Q6: The reality of politics suggests that each incoming government can change as much as they like. The

barrier to change should be fairly high, but changes in either direction may be good policy for a given set of circumstances.



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

I agree with most of the considerations, except: "economic circumstances and, in particular, the likely impact of the decision on the
economy and the competitiveness of particular sectors of the economy" I believe the reference to particular sectors of the economy
should be removed, in favour of considering the overall economy. If one sector is disadvantaged, but another is advantaged, then the

overall economic effect is neutral. Since any change should be motivated by reducing our GHG emissions, I would see the effect as
positive. Of course, dramatic upheaval should be avoided, as localised unemployment can contribute to social problems. Specifically,

all greenhouse gas emissions should be treated equally. Emissions from livestock should not be exempted.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
The government will not "achieve" the budget by itself. It can only act indirectly through citizens and businesses. It should set out

incentives, disincentives and policies for citizens and businesses, and it should plan how it will adjust those measures if the budgets
are not kept.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
I think the most important issue is how a government should react if a budget is not met. This is unfortunately a realistic scenario

given our own history with the Kyoto Protocol, and other countries' experience with national and international targets in the past. For
example what will be the rules around purchasing international credits to make up the deficit, and around reassessing future goals?



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
If I understand correctly, the proposal matches the second option on p42 "Advisory, with mechanisms built in to hold Government to
account". I believe that a democratically elected parliament should have the final say, but should be advised and rigorously monitored

by an independent expert body.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes
Same as my answer to Q11. If I understand correctly, the proposal matches the second option on p42 "Advisory, with mechanisms

built in to hold Government to account". I believe that a democratically elected parliament should have the final say, but should be
advised and rigorously monitored by an independent expert body.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
I assume, although it is not explicitly stated, that not every commissioner would need expertise in every field.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes

I think the bill will be better served to focus on reducing emissions. Expanding its scope may dilute efforts. It would be prudent to plan
for higher sea levels, more powerful storms and some level of climate refugees from Pacific Islands. These steps could be addressed

in a separate bill. My understanding is that the science of climate change adaptation is still very immature. This is reflected in the
proposals on p46-50 of Our Climate Your Say. Most proposals are to gather more information. This can be done without legislation.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No
Notes

Does this refer to the following bullet points?: • a national climate change risk assessment • a national adaptation plan • regular
review of progress towards implementing the national adaptation plan • an adaptation reporting power I think far more specifics are

required before this would constitute a plan. As mentioned above, climate change adaptation science is still very immature. Policy can
wait until the science is more settled.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
Gathering information is good.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

This bill is very very important. Climate change is an externality from so many human endeavours that leadership must come from
central government. I hope NZ's government will set a course to reach net zero emissions and eliminate our contribution to a global

problem. Beyond the scope of this bill, I hope they advocate internationally for other countries to match our goals. The current
practice of exempting livestock emissions from the ETS is arbitrary and unfair to other industries. The effect on our climate is the

same regardless of where gasses are produced, and our policy should reflect that.
