Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill












Reference no: 10287


Submitter Type:

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later

 Notes
 The process needs to include endorsement from all major political parties, there cant be a risk that it is repealed or fundamentally
 altered by successive governments




 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 In the short term, there is massive potential to reduce GHG through carbon offsets and potentially through changes to carbon
 accounting around wood products, this should buy us time to solve our major problems around agricultural emissions



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes
 "strong environmental safeguards" is key! there cant be any question marks of the legitimacy of imported units



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 There should always be scope for change but this should be very narrow. It cant be for "economic" reasons as this is too easily

 manipulated to mean, short term financial benefits.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes
 Any changes should be able to be made, but must be done with the consensus of the major parties, not simply a parliamentary
 majority



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Any changes should be able to be made, but must be done with the consensus of the major parties, not simply a parliamentary

majority



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
Yes, although under economic needs to be defined to ensure that long term economic impacts are considered as well as

externalities like environmental impacts. Often economic considerations are very narrow and only focus on profitability of business or
the impact on household budgets. We should also consider the potential for carbon leakage, we shouldn't be taking action to reduce

emissions domestically if it will cause production to shift to less efficient producers and a net increase in emissions.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

There needs to be consensus across parliament to ensure that the bill and its targets are enduring. Economic analysis of the costs
of action generally doesn't take into account the productivity gains we will experience from shifting to a low emissions economy. Yes

we have high per capita emissions due to agriculture, but we also have high emissions because we don't invest efficiently. Despite
having a highly urbanised population we under-invest in public transport and active modes making transport inefficient, we have very

poor housing stock leading to poor health outcomes and housing and building stock that is expensive to heat and maintain. We have
no standards on fuel economy for vehicles, an inefficient fleet and air pollution problems in Auckland as a result. Imagine the upside in

our own well being is carbon is a driver to once and for all change all of the above - the impacts of this are not calculated in any
economic analysis skew the GDP impacts.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No
