Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Hugh Thorpe, Hugh Rankin Thorpe








Reference no: 1949

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 Urgency on this issue is increasing rapidly. The government should set binding targets now for 2050



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 It has to be net zero emissions, given the urgency. In the longer term the world need to be working towards reducing atmospheric
 geenhose gases.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 Emissions trading has been a failure thus far. This is a global issue and so all nations must be reducing emissions and not trading

 rights to emit.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 Set a target and stick to it. The issue is too important to prevaricate.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 As long as the budgets are stringent.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes
 But see above




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No
 Notes

 Surely we can see beyond a 5 year horizon?
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes
This seems like a no-brainer!




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
This is the biggest global challenge ever! It has been said that it should be approached on a "War footing" and I am inclined to agree.

There appears to be agreement on a multi party approach to climate change actions which is a promising start. There must certainly
be international cooperation and scrutiny of the performance of individual countries.!




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
It is imperative that there be independent scrutiny of government performance. I agree with the functions proposed for the CCC.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
The government is elected to govern. Lets just see that they do a good job and if not, vote them out!



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Notes
There is no escaping adaptation since change is occurring already,but whether this should be written into the ZCB I am not sure.

Probably not. Keep the ZCB simple and pass other laws to deal with adaptation separately.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Notes

I am uncertain on this. How would "some organisations" be selected?



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
Thanks for the opportunity to make a submission. Obviously a huge effort has been made so far. Keep up the good work and keep

communicatiing. There are a huge number of worried/frightened people out here. I am of the older generation (81) and I worry for my
grandchildren and their grandchildren too.
