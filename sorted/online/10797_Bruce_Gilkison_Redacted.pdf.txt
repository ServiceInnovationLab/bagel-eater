Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Bruce Gilkison









Reference no: 10797

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes
 This is urgent - delays will mean the reductions will have to be much faster.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 It is vital that this should apply both to long-lived gases and to potent short-lived gases. There are many ways the latter can be

 reduced, especially with strong incentives to do so, and it is in the latter that New Zealand can have the strongest influence on the
 rest of the world - political, inspirational and in curbing potential warming.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes

 Provided these are from sources with strong environmental safeguards, use of overseas credits may be valid, e.g. credits from
 helping Pacific countries to protect or expand forests may be justified.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No

 Notes
 No, not unless there are new opportunities to accelerate reductions, or scientific studies suggest even greater urgency than is
 currently indicated, in which case emissions targets should be reduced faster.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 Budgets should be changed only to enable faster reduction of emissions.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
No

Notes
No, only to reduce emissions faster if opportunities to do this arise.




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
No, the importance of emissions reduction needs to override issues such as taxation and public borrowing.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

This requirement needs to be addressed urgently by governments.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

New Zealand's greatest impact on the world will be inspirational. Plans need to be ambitious and unwavering. We should work closely
with our Pacific neighbours.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
The role should be stronger than 'advisory'. Also, I don't believe the Commission should have a role in 'adaptation'. it should focus

100% on emissions reductions. Adaptation requires a very different skill set (e.g. focus on engineering, town planning), which should
be the role of other government agencies.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

It is important that the Commission should not be too closely wedded to the NZ ETS. The ETS may be a useful tool, but is not the
only one and is not necessarily the best. If there is a better one to replace this (e.g. a Carbon Tax) the Commission should be free to

say this.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

'Adaptation' expertise may be desirable but should not be essential. The Commission should focus 100% on reducing emissions.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
No, this Bill should focus on emissions reductions.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
This Bill should focus on emissions reductions.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes, but I don't believe that 'adaptation' is an item for inclusion in this Bill.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

While forestry is clearly a part of the New Zealand mix of solutions, this has limitations. Emissions such as carbon dioxide are certain,
and will be in the atmosphere a very long time. The effectiveness of forestry to offset is much less certain (forests could burn, or die

from drought or disease). It would be a mistake to rely too heavily on this to soak up emissions. Secondly, New Zealand has a
possibilty of major economic advantages by being a leader/early adopter, and should seize this opportunity to lead the world.
