Notes
Regarding clean Power Generation: Government could buy, say 100000 solar power systems in China and selling with a small profit

(to cover the interest/ opportunity cost) to residents. Germany is producing 15-20% of power generated from solar systems on
houses-,barns-, company- roofs. Why can we not with more sunshine in NZ? Regarding "clean" Economy: We could establish thriving
Kur House Centers in Northland (expanding to alternative treatment, health tourism). All it needs is the expertise (can get a Kur-

Doctor from Europe and Physiotherapist), fresh air and water. This is not available in New Zealand, but in Germany there a hundreds
of Kur-cities/ villages (called Bad/ Bath-cityname) providing these health services (degenerative disease, stress related dysfunctions

etc), particularly in areas with no income from industries (North Sea Coast and Bavaria). The "patients" live in private accommodations
(quality assured!) providing income for the population, also need small group tramping guides (lots of walking, cycling). The city is

charging a Kur-tax per night to provide some services and beautifying the city/village. I can provide more information if requested.
