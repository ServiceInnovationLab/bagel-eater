Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

    Vanja Pavarno








Reference no: 13148

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 We need to be a world leader in emissions reductions, in keeping with our "clean green NZ" image. Even though we are a small
 nation, every little bit helps and other nations will follow suit once enough countries plan and achieve radical change.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 Using international carbon units is cheating, it is using someone else's hard work and claiming it as our own. Each country meeting
 emissions targets on their own should achieve a greater reduction in total global emissions.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 The bill should allow for greater reductions, but it should not allow for reduction targets to decrease.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Yes; it would help break down the target into more manageable chunks.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
 Notes
 As for Question 4. We are all human. If we have a flexible deadline, we will not aim to meet it. A student who knows they can get an

 extension on their assignment will struggle to complete it on time!



 Clause
 12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

 (NZ ETS)?
 Position
 Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

 Notes
Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Adapting to existing climate change needs to go hand in hand with preventing further climate change. Eg new home design needs to
encompass low emissions principles (low energy inputs, low emissions output) & planting more trees in domestic neighbourhoods,

as well as adapting to existing change (building codes that provide resilience to natural disasters & provide protection from extreme
weather events).



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
Transparency is useful, we can learn from each other.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Targets around planting trees should also take into account trees felled, and consider limiting the felling of trees. The previous
blanket protection of trees in urban areas of Auckland under the Resource Management Act resulted in a significant increase in the

number of trees in the suburbs. In addition, policies encouraging the planting of fruit trees in local environments could reduce food
miles as well as foster community.
