Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Ross Lawrenson










Reference no: 668

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
 Notes
 The Government seems to be ignoring the cost of air travel in its considerations. Especially travel for tourists visiting New Zealand. If

 we are serious about climate change then we need to stop using up fossil fuels for pleasure and concentrate on the necessities
 such as feeding the planet. It seems we want to curtail our farming industry, with a goal of making more money from agriculture but

 feed less people. Yet we are encouraging more and more tourists to spew CO2 into the atmosphere travelling to New Zealand to go
 bungy jumping. Tourism is a dirty industry and we should be putting 100% tax on aero fuel in the same way we put a tax on petrol.
 This would make tourism a more sustainable industry and provide more level playing field



 Clause

 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
 Notes

 The Government neds to tackle the international aviation industry to reduce air travel to sustainable goals. Air travel should only be for
 necessities



 Clause
 12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

 (NZ ETS)?
 Notes

 It needs to look beyond our borders and the impact of international tourism should be included
