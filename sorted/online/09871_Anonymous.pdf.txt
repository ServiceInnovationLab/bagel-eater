Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill







Reference no: 9871

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes

 Rapid action is needed so a clear goal now would be good, but having the Climate Change Commission make specific targets based
 on further research/investigation seems like a good idea to ensure the best path for NZ



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived

 gases
 Notes
 Net Zero Emissions would be ideal, but due to NZ's dependency on agriculture in the economy this would be difficult to achieve and

 would garner more opposition, so having a more achievable goal with room for further improvement may lead to wider support and
 more progress.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 By managing this issue domestically, New Zealand would be a role-model for the rest of the world, and due to NZ's opportunities for

 renewable or green energy production we are in a unique position where this could be achievable.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 Yes, but only if heavy safeguards are in place and only in exceptional circumstances, this would need careful planning.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Stepping stones are needed to present smaller achievable steps and to measure progress



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
Potentially, but only with very heavy safeguards.




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
A wide approach is necessary, looking overseas and finding experts in many fields, along with driving and subsiding domestic
innovation in sustainable and renewable technologies. The transition will lead to a reduction of jobs in certain sectors, but if managed

correctly there is potential for growth in other sectors and new sectors entirely, and New Zealand has always been a land of
innovators.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
New Zealand is in a unique position to be a role-model for the rest of the world, due to our progress already in using renewable

energy sources for most of our power grid. Major improvements will need to be made in the agricultural industries to be able to
transition NZ towards Net Zero emissions, and these will only happen with clear policy and targets from the Government. Alongside

this the government needs to help drive innovation in the domestic technological sector, which in return may make up for a decrease
of the agricultural sector.
