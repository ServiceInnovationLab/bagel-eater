Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

John Roberts




Reference no: 11237

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 James Shaw says "the frequency and the severity of storms, coastal and river flooding, droughts, and wildfires are increasing." This is
 unsupported in history and data, it is unsupported even in NZs own recorded data as witnessed in the governments report Our

 Atmosphere and Climate 2017.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes
 The government should set NO target as the data does not support the current 'climate change' scare. I have marked option two as

 the lesser of the wrongs being forced on us.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Notes
 The data does not support the current 'climate change' scare. There should be no targets to meet.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 No

 Notes
 There is no need for any emissions budget. The data does not support the current 'climate change' scare.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes
 There is no need for emissions budgets, the data does not support the current 'climate change' scare. The money wasted on this

 non problem is better spent elsewhere.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes
 There is no need for emissions budgets, the data does not support the current 'climate change' scare. The money wasted on this

 non problem is better spent elsewhere.



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Notes
Why? There is no need, the data does not support the current 'climate change' scare.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Science, they should consider real science not political pseudo science. If they did that they would discover their emperor has no
clothes.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes
pseudo science doesn't count.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes
Why have either, the data does not support the current 'climate change' scare.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes
Try bringing some actual real science into it.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes

We have being adapting to the changing climate for ever, nothing has changed.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

There is no evidence emissions are affecting the global climate.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes

We already know the risks, nothing has changed.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
The data does not support the current 'climate change' scare. The time and money wasted on this non problem is better spent
elsewhere.
