Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

University of Waikato (Robert Stratford)








Reference no: 10950

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 Stabilised short lived could be okay if they are much lower than today's levels.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 Maybe use international carbon credits if they had any integrity, which is not the case currently.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Things change.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Notes
 Not sure of the implications here.




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes
 Budgets (or at least targets) should be part of the work of any independent commission anyway.




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No

 Notes
 Well, if it had a good reason (revise it down, for example).



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes, it should be a central policy consideration.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The usual partners domestically. Our trade partners are important internationally... if we are able to say that our country is zero carbon
then so is our wool, cheese, tourism etc...




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
I think that this is too narrow. I want to see an independent commission on New Zealand's progress with the Sustainable

Development Goals. This organisation should have at its core the aspiration that New Zealand becomes an ecological democracy (as
I have set out in my doctorate).



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
Bit of a technical question. An independent climate commission only has to ensure the integrity of the process, not do everything.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No
Notes

Pretty mainstream stuff. There needs to be a contribution from ecological economics (i.e. Clive Spash, Peter Brown, Peter
Timmerman, Tim Jackson etc) to create some richer alternative thinking.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No
Notes

That should be somewhere else.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
Just to go back to the point about the need for the Independent Commission to cover the United Nations Sustainable Development

Goals (including climate change). There seems no point getting the Carbon budget right if New Zealand does not address the wider
sustainability issues. Part of the issue in developing a policy approach at the time of the SDGs is the need to address the multi-

dimensional aspects of sustainability... including such things as decoupling, (or lowering our resource intensity), poverty, life on land
and below water etc. Sorry I have not been able to provide more details... I have to finish my thesis. :-)
