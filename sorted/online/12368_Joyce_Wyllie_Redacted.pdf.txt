 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 Set a target for 2050 but that is not binding...it is simply a realistic target



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Carbon Dioxide - Reducing net carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2050

 Notes
 Targets should be S.M A R T ....specific measurable attainable relevant and time-based.If option 2 or 3 is set then this would have
 such an impact on primary industries as to be not attainable or relevant .




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 .



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Then if the "real evidence " is produced that shows that climate change is not as fast or as significant as modelling is predicting the
 targets can be extended or reduced



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Some flexibility is neccessary



 Clause

 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 With some flexibility still that these plans are not fixed in concrete



 Clause

 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Researchers ...people who will come up with new products to reduce emissions Agriculture...how it will impact production ( both cost

of production and volume) as this impacts exports and NZ economy



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

The commission must always function with govt and not independent



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position

Notes
Because most of the decisions today are based on models...so as real data comes through there will need to be modifications as

predictions are proved true or otherwise
