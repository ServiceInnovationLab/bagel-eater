Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 12512

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 At the least, the Government should set a 2050 target in legislation now. Taking into account the dramatic and dangerous impacts of
 climate change already on our doorstep, legislation should establish the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees, and that means

 rapid cuts in all greenhouse gases beginning now. I support a net-zero target of 2040 with the majority of cuts occurring over the
 next decade.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 Methane needs to be treated the same as carbon because of the intensity of its warming effect. Considering our emissions are

 disproportionately made up of methane, compared to other countries, we need to set a global precedent for the treatment of
 methane.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 I believe New Zealand’s targets must be achieved by actual cuts in our own emissions, and not through the purchase of overseas
 carbon credits or an over-reliance on forests as carbon sinks. I support mitigation steps that benefits the communities in which they

 are situated, and enable local people to enact the structural change we need for a safe climate future.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 I only support this clause if it is to revise the target to be more ambitious.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes
 There should only be allowance to alter the last emissions budget if it is to increase ambition and scope of action. There should be
 no allowance for an incoming government to weaken action/budget.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Under exceptional circumstances, yes. For example, it might be appropriate to change an upcoming budget after an extreme natural

disaster (such as a major earthquake). Any revision should require input from the Climate Change Commission and approval by
Parliament.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

I support the focus on scientific knowledge, social circumstances and the Treaty of Waitangi taking precedence in considerations for
budgets. I also encourage global and local leadership, and creating a just and inclusive society to be included as key considerations.

Economic consideration is important, but needs to be considered in a long-term manner, that highlights the cost of inaction, and that
taking action early reduces the economic burden on future generations.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

This is a necessity.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

I support the principles of climate justice and just transition by putting the responsibility for climate change with those most
responsible for causing it. The poor, low-wage workers, Indigenous, and women must be empowered and enabled by, not be laden

with the costs of, climate change mitigation and adaptation. The government should also consider our global footprint. Investment
portfolios need to be accounted for in emission budgets. Investments in high emitting industries, such as the fossil fuel industry and

intensive dairying, must be counted as our own emissions. It is unacceptable to fund and profit from these practices without taking
responsibility for mitigating emissions. In the same sense, we must be answerable to mitigating the emissions of our exported
products, such as coal.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

The Climate Commission should only advise on ETS settings, it should not make final decisions



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

The delegation of commissioners should prioritise women, Māori, Pasifika, and climate scientists.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes
There has been a distinct lack of leadership from central government on adaptation. Guidance and a national plan should be

developed with local government.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

I support the Government being required to prepare a national climate risk assessment, and a national policy plan to address these
risks.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
