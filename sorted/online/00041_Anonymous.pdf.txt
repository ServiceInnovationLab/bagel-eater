 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 The environment needs to take priority over profit. If that means impacting "competitiveness", than so be it. But there needs to be a
 significant effort made to invest in sustainable and clean jobs here in NZ

Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Working with Ag to manage a transition from dairy to sustainable farming. Work with Oil companies and vehicle manufactures that
operate nationally to wholly fund electric charging stations and to offer electric vehicles on the NZ market. Help small and medium

businesses get access to finance for clean transport, to develop sustainable processes. Help NZers building homes and renovating
get access to finance fro solar and other sustainable materials for building.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
I believe the commission needs to be "Advisory, with mechanisms built in to hold Government to account"

Position

Yes
Notes

Conflicts of interest can not be tolerated. Prioritise science over business



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
Perhaps in a separate bill, but this needs to be done along side the zero-carbon bill

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
OF COURSE!




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

The commission must be independent, lack conflicts of interest (business interests that is), have the authority to set new rules and
targets and enforce them if there is inaction on behalf of govt. It must be as transparent as possible, work on behalf of people and

not profit and have the spine to stand up to powerful business interests that have vested interests that conflict with the health of the
environment. There also needs to be a lot more focus on agriculture and their impact on the environment. They are the single largest

contributor to greenhouse gasses and have done immense damage to our environment. They need to be held responsible and
must adapt to the changes that must be made to save our environment
