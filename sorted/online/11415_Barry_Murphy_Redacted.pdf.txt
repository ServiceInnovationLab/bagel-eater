 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Carbon Dioxide - Reducing net carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 Don’t spend money internationally on credits, do our bit locally and keen it local



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Always leave it open but set targets now and provide incentives to do so. If government can’t set incentives then don’t penalize by

 not allowing changes.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes

 Never know what mess labor will leave national so only fair it can be changed with new incoming government but not if the same
 government hold power



 Clause

 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

EV’s need more of a push. Free toll road for full BEV, guaranteed savings on WOF and REGO for x amount of years, either a tax break
or an annual credit towards fast chargers of $x per year. Government will need to work more with renewable energy to secure more

power during winter peaks where prices can become expensive. New builds should require a minimum of 4kw of solar, battery
storage customers both new and existing should receive a tax credit for assisting the grid in peak times, perhaps work with Tesla for

a virtual power grid where prices can be stabilized using the storage that has been tax credited.
