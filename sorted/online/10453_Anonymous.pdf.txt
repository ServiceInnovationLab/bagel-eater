Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill











Reference no: 10453

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes

 First, consider the role of carbon dioxide in relation to life as we know it - oxygen, photosynthesis etc. It is an essential trace gas.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 The current level at 0.043% is fine. The actual level is sufficiently above the minimum level of carbon dioxide where photosynthesis
 ceases to function (at 0.020%). At the level of 0.020% or approximately half the current atmospheric level, life and the environment as

 we know it on this planet would cease to exist. Nature balances this trace gas.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Notes
 The natural mitigations of emissions in NZ, and worldwide, as they are now, work well. This is proven in the measurement of our
 GHGs and relativity to populations here and worldwide.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Otherwise, if the pathway chosen is wrong, restrictive and misdirected legislation may not allow rapid rectification. However I do not

 see the need for a Zero Carbon Bill



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 Disagree, unless consideration is given to the actual data which indicates these proposals are political and not factual science based.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes
 Any and all budgets if instigated should be reviewed with actual data from scientific monitoring. That is the role of budgets. Any

 budget that is not constructed with measured and actual data - (not assumptions or modelling) should not be considered.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes

 All budgets if instigated must be reviewable. The wording of this question would indicate a manipulated and closed question
 submission form leading to questions about the outcome objective of the designer of this form.



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

It is essential the Govt and CCC take all factual data into considerations, not assumptions. Please refer to my response above.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Notes
It is essential to consider the effects of reductions of CO2, an essential trace element gas. At 0.02% all photosynthesis ceases.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The most important issue is to recognise that the IPCC has not been able to answer a specific question I have posed to their

secretariat which would indicate something is seriously wrong in this matter. The format of this particular form has been clearly set to
indicate a pre determined outcome, which is clearly anti democratic and a concern for any New Zealander. I have never struck

anything like this before. It is a sad commentary on the organisation who instgated approved this process.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

Unless the proposed CCC has some democratic balance, it should have no say whatsoever.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes

An ETS is a nonsense. Actual carbon dioxide concentrations prove that there are natural fully mitigating factors in place



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

Yes. That would be a good start! Essential that critical analysis of factual date data be kept to the fore.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
No

Notes
If climate change is caused by other factors, why would a Zero Carbon Bill cover climate change.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Notes
p47 relatively non specific. We have to expect climate change, that is the norm. As populations grow it makes no sense to allow

development in risk areas. This issue is quite separate from a political endeavour to promote a single and unproven "cause" of
climate change.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
No

Notes
Simply put, this in an attempt at unbridled political power and control. We live in a democracy. Again I am shocked at the nature and

restriction of questions in this form. I request that I be contacted at sometime to be able to discuss this with someone on the
commission. I have endeavoured to enter a table of factual data which I feel will not reproduce correctly and is important to the

submission I am making.
Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
I am a retired farmer from Cambridge. I wish to make a submission to the Our Climate, Your Say consultation on the Zero Carbo bill. As

a farmer, and like my fellow farmers, I have had a lifetime interest in climate and its changes. It had, and has, a major influence on my
occupation and the profitability of our enterprise. My interest in the subject of climate and climate change intensified from the period

where it was indicated that agriculture was responsible for 48% of the GHG emissions in New Zealand. How so, and why? I started my
research by contacting a scientist who was present and involved in the Kyoto negotiations, Richard Christie, Executive Director of the

South Island Dairying Development Centre. As a farmer, I was frustrated by the fact that under IPCC rules, no mitigating factors are
considered in the protocols New Zealand agreed to at Kyoto. The difficulty was, according to Richard Christie, that it would have been
difficult to establish those protocols, particularly in relation to New Zealand agriculture, in the negotiations. Richard’s final comment in

his email to me was the telling one – “Those negotiations seem to have much more to do with politics thant (sic) they do with saving
the planet”. I was to later challenge Prof Jacqui Rowarth of Waikato University at a public meeting as she spoke of the need for

agriculture to prepare to meet commitments in GHG reductions. I later discussed the issue at length with Jacqui. To my amazement I
discovered that Jacqui had no knowledge of the actual proportions of the atmosphere carbon dioxide and methane represented, nor

was she aware of these gases being measured and recorded here in New Zealand since 1960, nor carbon dioxide’s minute annual
increments (see table below). In New Zealand atmospheric gases are monitored and measured by our Ministry of the Environment at
Baring Head, in Wellington. When I advised Jacqui that carbon dioxide was 0.043% of the atmosphere, a mere trace gas, and vital for

the survival of life as we know it on this planet, in astonishment Jacqui exclaimed – “OMG!” I was stunned by Jacqui’s reaction. In
disbelief she asked me if what I said was true. I advised Jacqui to check the information out herself. She later did. I still wonder how

many of the advocates for reductions in carbon dioxide know this fact. To clarify – that is one four hundred and thirtieth of one percent
of the atmosphere! Halve that amount of carbon dioxide to 0.02%, and all life as we know it will cease to exist. Photosynthesis stops

at this level! Carbon dioxide, a trace gas, is the building block of life as we know it, our environment, our food, our oxygen. It is
essential to life. Despite what some would promote, our atmosphere is not awash with this gas. It is measured and monitored. 1850

1960 2012 Co2 ATMOSPHERIC PERCENTAGE 0.0425% 0.0360% 0.0430% WORLDWIDE MOTOR VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS Nil
126,888,000 1,114,558,000 ATMOSPHERIC CO2 INCREMENT ANNUALLY 1.5-1.6 ppm/Yr 1.5-1.6 ppm/Yr The interesting observation of
the tabled data – factual and recorded - is that there appears to be very little relationship with the combustion engine and the actual

atmospheric content of carbon dioxide. There was a drop indicated in the 1960 figure which could corelate to the quiet industrial
period of 15 years following World War Two, suggesting minute increments as a result of human activity. In preparation to put my

submission into writing I emailed the advertised email address on the Consultation website with the following request on the 25th
June: “Could someone on the Climate Change Team please supply me with a reference, or references, to the specific and conclusive

peer reviewed research that directly attributes and clearly demonstrates scientifically, that atmospheric carbon dioxide, and the
reduction of this gas from its present level at approximately 0.043% of the atmosphere will directly and conclusively change the
world’s climate to the exclusion of all other potential causes. I would also be interested to know, to what level should this gas be

reduced to satisfy a “Zero Carbon” policy.” Being advised after a follow up that the matter was being worked on, I was eventually
directed to an IPCC 5th Assessment Report and told “This report represents the global scientific consensus on climate change,

which the New Zealand Government accepts.” Simply, the Climate Change Consultation team were unable to specifically answer my
request, not that I fully expected the team to be able to provide that answer or answers. So why would a government accept that

assessment? How much research has it carried out? I then elected to contact the secretariat of IPCC in Geneva and made the same
request. Mxolisi Shongwe of the IPCC Sectretariat finally responded. Again, I was presented with two website links outlining the

Assessment report 5, Chapter 10 wherein I was promised I would find my answer. I was faced with a raft of modelling and
assessments in a report spanning. The reports did not answer the specific information I requested. I was confronted with an
elaborate raft of IPCC assessments all of which in some form or another endeavour to “fingerprint” changes in temperature and link

them to GHG’s. The most common term used by all the authors was ‘likely’ or ‘most likely’. Much, if not all of the data published was
either presumptions or forced modelling. There was no established and demonstrated fact showing clear and proven links that the

miniscule actual and measured increment of a trace gas, carbon dioxide, in any way, was capable of being a major cause of climate
change. Analysing the actual data in the table above, and assuming the consensus of contributors to the IPCC case was that the

increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide was the source of global climate change, this would actually mean that from 1960 when the
above records were made by the Ministry of the Environment to the 2012 level and beyond, a span of 52 years and beyond – an
increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide by 16.28% of one four hundred and thirtieth of 1% of this trace gas is causing global climate

change. Little wonder that the IPCC secretariat was unable to answer my question! So where from here? Nowhere in the official IPCC
literature did I find any mention of, or reference to, a known and significant natural cause of climate change., the Milankovitch orbital

variations. Following study, the National Research Council of the US National Academy of Sciences has embraced the Milankovitch
Cycle Model ...orbital variations remain the most thoroughly examined mechanism of climatic change on time scales of tens of

thousands of years and are by far the clearest case of a direct effect of changing insolation on the lower atmosphere of Earth
(National Research Council, 1982). Orbital variations of the planet, ie. changes in orbital eccentricity affect the earth-sun distance.

Currently, a difference of only 3% (5 million kilometres) exists between closest approach (perihelion), which occurs on or about 3
January, and furthest departure (aphelion), which occurs on or about 4 July . The other is variation in Axial Obliquity. The change in the
tilt of the earth’s axis (obliquity) effects the magnitude of seasonal change. At higher tilts the seasons are more extreme, and at lower

tilts they are milder. The current tilt according to NASA is 23.5 degrees nearing its highest tilt. We are currently observing apparently
greater extremes in climate which would be consistent with the above known facts In summary • There is no such thing as normal

when we consider climate. • A change in climate – which, forever changes - is to be expected. That we, living on a planet hurtling
through space at 36,000 mph, and expect it to fly a precise orbit is nonsense. • The world is growing in population, we live in a time

of instant communication and graphic video of what is occurring. If I had had a modern cell phone in the 1950’s I could have recorded
flooding on our own property that has never occurred since. The result of that flood instigated the Waikato River Flood protection
scheme, dissipating these events in a managed way. My video from one particular “cloud burst” would have flashed across the world

like what we see occasionally today. It was spectacular. As our communities and population grow, worldwide and here, there are
places that just should not exist as and where they are. For example, Edgecumbe in the Bay of Plenty will flood again. It is built

alongside a river with a huge catchment on a flood plain. Whanganui is similar. The world is embarking on change such as electric
vehicles and the management of the environment and resources. That is good. Our resources are finite. To believe that Carbon
Dioxide is the cause of climate change, simply beggars belief when one considers fact rather than hypothetical modelling. I

understand the difficulty of having to meet obligations previously entered, however I would rather see New Zealand take a measured
and thoroughly critiqued approach to “the scientific consensus” of the IPCC Assessment Reports which show its authors and
contributors qualitative level of confidence from very low (more predominantly) to very high (seldom). As Richard Christie said, “This

has much more to do with politics than they do with saving the planet” Therefore, I pose my question directly to the Climate Change
Public consultancy and to the Government which accepts this “scientific” consensus, and that is simply: Either the Government or

the Climate Change Team please supply me (and the New Zealand public) with a reference, or references, to the specific and
conclusive peer reviewed research that directly attributes and clearly demonstrates scientifically, that atmospheric carbon dioxide,
and the reduction of this gas from its present level at approximately 0.043% of the atmosphere will directly and conclusively change

the world’s climate to the exclusion of all other potential causes. I expect, and demand a specific, conclusive answer that would justify
the economic cost of current solutions that are being promoted. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this directly with the

commission if it were possible.
