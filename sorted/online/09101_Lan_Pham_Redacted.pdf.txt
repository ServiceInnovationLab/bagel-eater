Reference no: 9101

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 For the most serious issue facing humanity and all life on earth we need serious action. Set legislation as fast as possible. Goals are
 too airy-fairy.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 I support taking a science-based approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible: we should aim for

 negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. I support this option but by 2030 not 2050
 and only if short-lived gases are cut swiftly and drastically by 2030 before stabilising. It will be willful negligence for the government to

 approach this in any longer timeframe.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 We must take responsibility for our own emissions, not buy our way out of a meaningful contribution to reducing GHG's. I feel very
 strongly about this. Every country needs to be part of the solution. We've already embarrassed ourselves internationally by relying on
 international credits and creative accounting with carbon sinks to meet our international commitments. We need to set a gross

 emissions reduction target (rather than a net one, which includes trees as carbon sink offsets). We need the Government to create
 an environment where it is not a financially viable option for, for example, Fonterra - or Greymouth Hospital - to build new coal-fired
 boilers because they are the cheapest option. I agree with the PCE who pointed out “Each tonne of emissions offset by forestry is a

 tonne not reduced at source. Relying too heavily on forestry could lead to continued high levels of gross emissions. Pressure to
 reduce these after 2050 could entail a more costly and disruptive transition than a deeper transition commenced earlier.”



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Yes, exceptional circumstances should allow target to be revised eg. greater scientific understanding, however this should only allow

 for more stringent targets, not more lax targets.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Yes! Let's get moving!



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.

However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in scientific understanding or international agreements should be
permitted.




Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
As above.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should take the following factors into consideration when advising on and

setting budgets: • scientific knowledge regarding climate change • technology relevant to climate change • economic
circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the
economy • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on taxation, public spending and public borrowing • social

circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel poverty • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Notes
Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable,
and reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to
the number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
I agree with the following collective expertise: • climate change policy (including emissions trading) • resource economics and

impacts (including social impacts, labour markets and distribution) • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori
interests • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like

planning, insurance and local government • risk management • engineering and/or infrastructure • community engagement and
communications. • business competitiveness • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology development system.

I think expertise in public health is also important.
Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Notes
Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within the Climate Commission.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Notes
I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance is required in terms of how local councils are involved: • a

national climate change risk assessment • a national adaptation plan • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
adaptation plan • an adaptation reporting power I also believe there needs to be a clear mandate given to local government to

compel them to mitigate GHG emissions so they can take them into account in resource consent decisions etc.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Notes

Yes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
Please be ambitious. We are running out of time. This is about intergenerational justice - we can not ignore future generations. Let's

fix this mess we've created and not kick the can to future generations.
