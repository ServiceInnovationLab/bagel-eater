Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

David Crook









Reference no: 1745

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes

 Zero emissions is an impossible target, a level of reduced emissions is far more realistic. Furthermore the economic cost has not
 been properly quantified.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Notes
 This target should not be set at all, yet alone considered



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Notes

 It should not be sethoever if it is it most certainly should include provision to change it



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 No

 Notes
 First how the targets (if set) will be met needs to be advised and duly scrutinised



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes
 Government should be able to alter any target (if set) at any time and especially any new government that has the mandate from the

 voters to do so.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes
 Government should be able to alter any target (if set) at any time and especially any new government that has the mandate from the

 voters to do so.



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
There is not enough evidence to support any of the proposed changes. As a minimum, more fact based evidence needs to be

provided.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Notes
There should not be a zero carbon bill, it is an impossible target.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
There should as a minimum be a referendum to support this massive change, and such referendum must have a clear majority of

support. No bill, no budgets, until there is a clear mandate for the Government to even consider it.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No
Notes

Any advice/monitoring must be done by a wider group to ensure such advice/monitoring is properly doen and free from political
interference.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Notes
The scheme is flawed. They should be advising (if at all) on how to make it more realistic.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes
The proposed expertise is biased




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes

There is no substantive evidence to support any link between zero carbon and climate change. Climate change statistics have been
proven to be seriously flawed.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
Given the flawed information available on climate change, no functions proposed have any basis.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
No

Notes
Stop wasting public money on climate change/zero emissions until there is some real, factual, hard evidence to support the changes

proposed. Unfortunately this in itself is an unreal target given the political manipulation of evidence to date.
Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
No zero emissions, no climate change legislation without a public referendum to give a clear mandate. The current government does

not have such a mandate.
