 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 The question about methane needs to be researched. Methane cannot be excluded as even when it decays it oxidizes to CO2 at a
 multiplier of roughly 3. The warming potential of methane varies depending on the time frame we are looking at (from 72 for a 20 year

 horizon to 7.6 for a 500 year horizon according to IPPC AR4 (2007)) These values used by the IPPC have also changed over time.
 (latest for IPPC AR% (2013) are 20 years 86 and 100 years 34). We need to get this right as the wrong data will lead to putting effort

 into the wrong innovation. However as a default we should use the internationally accepted one (as that is how our international
 obligations will be measured) but put research effort into understanding what is the appropriate multiplier and time-frame. This is
 most important to NZ so we may need to lead here.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes

 We should use overseas emissions reduction credits only when they are environmentally sound, scientifically supported and form
 part of a bilateral arrangement with developing countries to help them with their transition. Reductions from native forest
 enhancement would be an example where we could have mutual beneficial arrangements with some developing countries.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes
 Any changes would have to be justified by changed circumstances or knowledge.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No
 Notes



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Needs to be very explicit about the need to consider how these form a path to meeting the 2050 target



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Business needs to be involved as it can facilitate transition and innovation. The budgets need to be consistent with a transition

pathway. Some industries e.g electricity need to be consulted on the roadblocks and constrictions. Government may have role in
establishing appropriate infrastructure (similar to the fast broadband initiative). Industry with potential stranded assets need be

consulted. However the goals need to be firm.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
It's an advisory group and should keep away from trying to control just one tool



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

There should be some business experience as well Inter-generational views should be considered



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
