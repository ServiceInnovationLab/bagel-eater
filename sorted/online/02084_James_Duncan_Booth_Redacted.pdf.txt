Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

James Booth, James Duncan Booth









Reference no: 2084

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes
 I can't help but feel that the process of setting up the commission and then having it advise on targets is just more kicking the can

 down the road. We should set ambitious targets now, and if sound science comes in that subsequently suggests we should modify
 them then the CCC can advise on this through an approporiate mechanism



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived

 gases
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 ETS is by it's nature opaque and open to fraud. More importantly, ETS's allow richer nations to "buy virtue" rather than committing to

 the fundamental changes that need to be made. They entrench business as usual mindsets by paying to defer any meaningful
 change.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 But only based on sound new science, not political or economic expediency.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes
 And there should be some limitations around it e.g. only based on recommendations from the CCC.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
Notes




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes
The last three considerations sound reasonable, but really they are the get-out-of-jail-free cards for the government of the day.

Basically, if voters are unhappy that taxes will go up, or fossil fuel costs will rise, then it's a factor in the decision making. These should
not be explicit factors, since by the nature of politics the government of the day will be jumping through hoops to accommodate them

anyway, and we need the CCC to be focused entirely on the goal, not political considerations of the day.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
Business needs certainty and clarity. The future does not look like today, and any business that thinks it does is already dead. There

is no need for business to fear change, but lack of a clear, committed path to get there is the biggest risk to business.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The rapid pace of technological change means there needs to be constant dialogue with the science and technology sector. There
is no escaping the big impact a genuinely effective plan will have on agriculture, and the current constant exemptions and general
"agriculture is special, agriculture is too important" based on immediate economic expediency needs to end. Farmers need to be

actively involved, and they must be allowed to work out the best way to achieve the targets for themselves, but they should not be
given an easier ride than anyone else. To do so completely undermines the entire project.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

I disagree with ETS schemes, but ultimately it is up to the government to decide.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

NZ needs to do its part, but ultimately if other nations do not then we will have to adapt.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

It is critical that central government takes a leadership role. Leaving local councils to individually work policy out for themselves is
inefficient and leads to uncertainty, variability and limited action.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
Should apply to anyone owning or managing significant or critical infrastructure.
