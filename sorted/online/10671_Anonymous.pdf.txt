Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 10671

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 New Zealand has a unique position being known as 'clean', 'green', 'pure' with out beautiful forestry, scenery, lakes, rivers and
 mountains. In 1987 New Zealand implemented the New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act. We should

 triple down on those sentiments. Do everything we can to build a zero emissions, zero nuclear, 100% renewable 'circular society' for
 our health and future, our children's future, New Zealand as a desirable place to live and visit and Earth. To me it makes sense for

 New Zealand to strive to be a world leader in green energy. That is the type of country I want to live in.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
 Notes

 Carbon tax? It could be beneficial if a carbon tax was implemented which steadily increased each year, that increase being known
 years in advance. This would allow individuals to see clear financial benefits to making cleaner investments (EV, solar panels, local
 produce). Appropriate marketing for citizens explaining the 'why' of the tax. A benefit would be if it was easy for a citizen to easily track

 and see the tax being spent 100% toward renewable generation / carbon reduction. The ultimate goal for this tax would not to be
 sustainable but to keep increasing but constantly see less in total collections (clean (untaxed) tech incentivized). This is not my area

 of expertise.



 Clause
 11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
 its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
