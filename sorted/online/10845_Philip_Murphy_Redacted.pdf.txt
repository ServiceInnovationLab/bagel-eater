Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Phil Murphy, Mingi Valley Ltd (Philip Joseph Murphy)








Reference no: 10845

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 To the best of my knowledge net zero emission is not possible as there is no way on a large scale to mitigate emissions that come

 from permanently under the ground (coal oil gas and limestone). Forestry is only a temporary holder of carbon.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Carbon Dioxide - Reducing net carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2050
 Notes

 How many people filling in this form understand the difference between carbon emissions that come from a permanently locked up
 under the ground source and those that originate from the atmosphere to where it is returned. e.g. Methane that comes from oil or
 gas extraction is exactly the same gas as ruminants produce by eating grass, but one is adding to the atmospheric carbon and the

 other is adding zero.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 We do not know what science will come up with so obviously we have to be flexible.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 We have to stop adding NET carbon to the atmosphere where we can (Livestock do not add net carbon from methane - except for

 the coal oil and gas we use to produce meat and wool etc). At this stage in history we cannot permanently mitigate or off-set our coal
 oil and gas use on a large scale so the first achievable goal should be to produce all our electricity by renewable sources - which
 means more hydro dams. Many people believe we can mitigate our carbon emissions by planting trees where the reality is it just buys

 a little time and until people realise this they are unlikely to change their habits. Planting a tree will not permanently mitigate your air
 New Zealand flight emissions.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
No

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Use science and evidence based information taking into account the economics off all actions. The issue is NET carbon and people
need to be informed they cannot, at this stage in history, permanently mitigate their coal oil gas and limestone use - which will help

people realise they have to change their habits and why Governments make the decisions they do.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

As a farmer I would like to make a couple of points. 1. The wording of Agriculture not being in the emissions trading scheme is
incorrect and misleading - plus it makes us look like we are being subsidised by the city majority. Agricultural emissions, I assume, are

Methane produced by Ruminants and Nitrous oxide. Methane (CH4) produced by ruminants in a steady state (i.e. numbers not
changing) is increasing carbon in the atmosphere by ZERO (unlike Methane from the the oil and gas industry, which is a by-product,

where all added carbon is cumulative in the atmosphere). I started farming in 1980 and if the stock numbers are the same now as
then - my livestock have added ZERO carbon or methane to the atmosphere so therefore ZERO CLIMATE CHANGE, but all my usage
of coal oil limestone and gas, including methane has increased the concentration in the atmosphere therefore aiding man induced

climate change. How could it be justified to charge a farmer for livestock produced methane if that methane is in a steady state and
not adding any carbon to the atmosphere or adding to man induced climate change. Methane is a short lived gas of approx 9-12

years. I realise the planet would be better off if sheep, cattle and deer were not ruminants but us farmers are helping to pay for world
leading research into minimising livestock methane emissions. I believe the non farming community do not understand that livestock

do not produce carbon - they recycle it. Generally farmers are doing their best to minimise Nitrous Oxide emissions. 2. As I have
already stated I believe many people do not realise that forestry just buys the planet a little time and will not permanently mitigate our

coal, oil, limestone and gas emissions. I say this as someone who has planted many thousands of Pinetrees from an early age till now.
