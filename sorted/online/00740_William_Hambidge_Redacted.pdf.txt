Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

William Hambidge








Reference no: 740

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 Don't let's have any more delays!



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 I would be happy for a lower reduction target for animal derived methane, provided it was no higher than 30% of the 1990 level



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 I totally oppose buying carbon credits to cover shortfalls in our emissions targets. I am in favour of contributing to funds to assist
 developing countries to meet their targets in addition to achieving zero net emissions within NZ




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 We have procrastinated too long too allow any further postponement of targets.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No
 Notes



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
I feel that whilst economic factors should be considered, the over-riding priority should be to achieve zero carbon by or before 2050.

The government should seek to lessen the impact of measures on poorer people by some means other than postponing
achievement of carbon zero. Failure to control emissions will have much worse repercussions than any impact of control measures. In
fact I think our country will be better off from speeding up the "Zero Emission" programme.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes

The Cimate commission should also review such plans and comment on their adequacy.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
1) Keeping global temperatures below 1.5 degrees warming. 2) minimising effects of emission controls on the poorest in the
community. 3) Scrapping ETS and imposing a steadily increasing and punitive carbon tax.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

I believe the ETS should be scrapped and a carbon tax be set up instead. If the government will not scrap the ETS, and impose a
steadily increasing carbon tax, then the ETS should be run by an independent body like the Climate commission. That body should

have the mandate to impose a reducing cap on emissions and carbon credits, and set very high minimum prices at which credits can
be traded.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

We should be prepared to fund "retreat" policies but we should also legislate strongly against new building & infrastructure within 5
metres above high water mark.
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

I want to reiterate my total opposition to the E.T.S. The governments review of the scheme in 2016 found that it had had no
significant effect in reducing emissions. Other countries have had similar problems. I favour a carbon tax which is initially set at the

current market level of ETS credits. It should automatically increase by 5% cumulatively each year so that polluters can see from the
outset that reducing emissions is the only acceptable way of staying in business. Credits could be used to pay the tax during the first

5 years but would stay at the 2018 market price, so that they would steadily become less valuable in paying the tax. We must keep as
a top priority, the need to stop further global warming and also work towards reversing warming that has already taken place so that
we can return to temperatures as at mid 20th century & around 350 ppm of CO2 or less in the atmosphere. I suggest two measures

which will help achieve a zero carbon economy: 1) Legislate to stop the sales of new internal combustion engines by 2040 or earlier.
If this is done now then individuals and businesses will get a clear message that fossil fuel use is on the way out. Transport

contributes 19% of NZ CO2 emissions plus some N2O emissions so will have to be cut some time anyway. 2) Legislate that all new
buildings must be energy self sufficient. This will have a dual effect of taking the strain off energy providers as electric vehicles make

more demands on the system, and also provide for charging EV's at home and work without using grid power. The other advantage
would be to make buildings more resilient after earthquakes or other natural disasters.
