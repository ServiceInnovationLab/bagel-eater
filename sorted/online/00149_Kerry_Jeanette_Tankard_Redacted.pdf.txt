Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Kerry Jeanette Tankard






Reference no: 149


Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later

 Notes
 Make it possible to revise year-on-year, eg: if uptake of EV’s exceeds expectations, target can be adjusted accordingly. Don’t want
 people to think they can just have a year off for other people’s good behaviour ;-)



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 Focussing on CO2 ignores the ‘bump’ that CH3 gives to atmospheric carbon




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes

 Carbon trading is already being relied on by many significant emitters. Yes, plant as many trees as you can, including native flora in
 appropriate places, but we’ll still need to buy offsets imho. Especially if storm damage is to be taken into account.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Would love to see us hit the target earlier. Modulo Trump doesn’t set off WW3 & create Nuclear winter. All bets are off in that scenario.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Specific, achievable & measurable goals always win over handwave aspirations. Make sure that measurement of effects of goals is
 built in from the start!



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes
 Needs to have some clarity around the global commitment that NZ is signed up to, & some structure & rigour to prevent frivolous

 changes or suspension of targets. Don’t let another John Key do to this, what he did to the Cullen Fund - our Superannuation is
 flawed now from 9 years of deferred contributions from Gov’t.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

No forecasting tool ever can be 100% accurate. Unexpected events occur, both in the environment and in the economy. It would be
hugely unrealistic for there to be no capacity for adjustments to be made, to conform to irl circumstances on the planet.... ;-/



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
MY hardline position would be to ban all oil industry representatives from any position within the Commission. I realise this is an outlier
position to hold. I consider it valid, when the history of oil industry interference with uptake of science around climate change is taken

into account. They will fight their way into the sunset. We don’t have to consider their profit losses - they had no consideration for the
lives of millions of people who will be displaced by sea level rise, or storm damage.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes

Transparency and accountability to citizens is very important. ‘Commercial sensitivities’ have been used to stifle citizen dissent for too
long. A broader understanding of what can be done for a just transition is necessary to allay fears that have been promulgated by

those with vested interests in the status quo.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

*Sunset industries - need to have re-training/ redeployment options up front with the reduction budgeting. *New tech - need to
ensure training of people who will work in these areas is prioritised - whether that be subsidies for (re-)training or scholarships in

particular areas of engineering/tech. *Need good PR for non-technical citizens so that they can be adequately informed about
options during transition period. *Need supports for low-income households as transition to low carbon lifestyle continues - maybe

with some ‘stick’ for landlords, etc, to get them moving on insulation, energy-efficient heating, solar panels, etc. Germany as an
exemplar for solar panels on every roof. As transport fuels rise in cost, assistance to transition to EV’s might become a thing. *Local
govt buy-in on regional scale public transport upgrades, focus on getting people into mass transit & out of single occupant vehicles.

*Framing inner-city intensification along energy-efficiency lines. Combine high density housing with access to community gardens for
sustainable living solutions. This is frequently not considered in our provincial cities, who perceive themselves as having small

footprints & in no need of inner city intensification for housing, PT functions. *Industries & businesses may need assistance to see
how they can reduce waste, reduce carbon footprint, thus improving their own triple bottom lines. Perhaps a greater role for

Sustainable Business Network as leaders in transition to future sustainability. *Ag sector needs to be brought into the transition
carefully. One trip to Fieldays is enough to make a city person realise that farm equipment investment is a major in modern Ag - an EV
for the family is not the big concern, when you owe half the cost of an IH farm machine. Mechanisation & automation on farms has

been about reducing staffing costs over the past generation - efficiencies of scale have been created, by using fossil fuels to replace
horses & humans. They’re not going to flip back to the 1930’s style of labour intensive farming without a fight, nor is there enough

investment in producing machinery that doesn’t run on fossil fuels. The ‘burping cattle’ are just a minor nuisance inside the bigger
picture of reliance on machinery to get the job done.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Using overseas examples as templates is a no brainer. EU & UK have been on this problem for decades, why reinvent the wheel?



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Our mix of expertise needs to be broader than UK, due to Te Tiriti considerations. We have historically traded with a multitude of other
countries; this gives us strength in negotiation skills that the UK has lacked recently due to it’s reliance on EU-wide trade deals. Our
Commission should be given tasking that draws on our already extensive skill base for international negotiation, so that our

relationships with other countries are fostered by our climate change decisions, not ruptured.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes
Impacts of climate disasters are already hitting local government budgeting. Making local adaptations (like moving roads or bridges)

to give resilience to communities at risk, should not be hamstrung by inflexibility in carbon budgeting or legislation.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

As soon as possible, please. Communities like Edgecumbe & South Dunedin needed this five years ago. The presence of climate
change denying Mayor & some City Councillors in Hamilton is hampering attempts to plan for mitigation, adaptation & local changes

to respond to climate change. Submissions from the public are set aside, poor decisions are being rushed through by those with
vested interests and no science literacy. For the sake of the wider Waikato context, there needs to be legislation to guide local
government, to prevent perverse outcomes generated by self- interested individuals.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
Insurance companies are already adjusting their risk tables. Businesses & organisations who fail to plan for adaptation risk having it

thrust upon them by denial of insurance cover.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
Thanks to MfE & Minister for offering wide consultation with the public at large. Been gagged for nine long years! Nice to have a voice

again. I consent to the publication of my name with this submission. I do not wish my residential address to be published; my
electronic address is fine.
