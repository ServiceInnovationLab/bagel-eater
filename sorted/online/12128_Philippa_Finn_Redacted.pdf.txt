Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Philippa Finn






Reference no: 12128


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later

 Notes
 We should be targeting earlier than 2050, and the government needs to move in lockstep to make it happen.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 NZ should be leading the way! We shouldn’t be afraid to set an ambitious goal and believe that we can achieve it in a way that is good
 for our economy. It’s time we walked the Clean Green walk!




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 We should be exporting emissions credits, not importing them!!




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Only to bring the dates forward. No loopholes for later excuses. Change needs to happen now! Whatever happens, we should be

 able to figure out solutions that fit with our goals and our obligations to future generations.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Yes, and the information on how we are performing should be extremely accessible. Bet more people would be on board if we could

 see our scoreboard.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes

 Only to be revised down - i.e. made more ambitious



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
Whatever may come, minimising emissions should be part of our M.O.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes

It should be a KPI of every portfolio/ministry.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Every department is responsible. Every part of government needs to have environmental considerations ingrained into everything
that they do.




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
NZ should be leading the world on this. Let’s set a big, ambitious goal and then overachieve on it!!
