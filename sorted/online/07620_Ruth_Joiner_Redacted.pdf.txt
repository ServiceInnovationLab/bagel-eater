Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Ruth Joiner








Reference no: 7620

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 Unless there is a target set in legislation there is not enough incentive to work towards this. Vague goals will not achieve enough
 change.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 It is an ambitious target but we need to drive decisive and meaningful change in the way we use resources. We have a small enough

 population and enough flexibility in how we choose to use our resources to attain this target.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 We need to lead on this issue and demonstrate that the change is possible domestically. Using emissions reductions from abroad will
 not achieve the overall level of change needed.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Yes - but only in a more progressive way ie for the better not for the worse.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
 Notes
 The targets and budget will help set a more robust future economy, there should be no need to change these due to exceptional

 circumstances, they should already provide a best practice framework for economic stability and future economic success.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
These should definitely include consideration of global climate effects and the overall environmental impact of the budget.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Funding for scientific research and backing private initiatives that will help meet emission targets. Consideration of the poorer

members of society to ensure the bill is footed by those of us who have the ability to pay, who are inevitably the ones contributing
most to the problem.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
We are a small country with a history of innovation which should make us ideally placed to enact real, substantial and revolutionary
change. We must resist the calls of those who for economic or social reasons want to retain the status quo. We cannot continue to

use resources and create waste (be it landfill or gas emissions) in the way we are doing at the moment. Investment in a 'greener'
economy will pay dividends in the the future not just in terms of climate change but also economical, social and lifestyle benefits that

need to be for all in Aotearoa.
