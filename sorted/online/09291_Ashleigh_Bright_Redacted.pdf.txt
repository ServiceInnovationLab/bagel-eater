Reference no: 9291

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes
 Long lived gases and short lived gases have different effects on WARMING, which is they key outcome not the emissions themselves.
 Establishing a target based on the different accounting of long and short lived gases will more accurately represent NZ's impact on

 climate change and enable the agricultural sector to understand their contribution to global warming and to develop policy proposals
 for mitigating their emissions. The climate debate has not been an easy one for NZ agriculture to get involved in positively. Myles et al

 (2018) research, which involves scientists from the University of Wellington provides the necessary scientific evidence and tools for
 the agricultural sector to define a pro-active narrative about what greenhouse gas emissions reductions can genuinely be achieved.
 This would enable the sector to engage in a manner that leads the way towards achieving the Paris Agreement. I understand that the

 NZ government may be reluctant to adopt a new accounting method for setting targets, primarily because the EU uses GWP not
 GWP*. I think this is a huge opportunity to lead the way in adopting ground breaking science, changing the conversation around
 agriculture and GHG emissions and enabling farmers to feel positive about their contributions to food and environment. This is

 particularly important for a country such as NZ where agriculture form such a large proportion of our GDP.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

New scientific evidence, technology, social implications, the ability of farmers to feel engaged and enabled by the plans



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

expertise on how outcomes on environment, agriculture production, animal welfare interact and down stream consequences of
budgets on these.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
