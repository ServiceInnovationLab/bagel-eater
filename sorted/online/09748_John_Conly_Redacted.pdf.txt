Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

John Conly, John Conly (John Conly)





Reference no: 9748

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 It seems pretty half-assed to buy international credits rather than actually solve our challenges here. It would be great to help farmers
 plant native trees - paying them to set aside areas or their whole farms instead of animal agriculture use (being responsible for most
 of our emissions).



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 To set a better target (not to water it down).



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
Farmers should be incentivised and helped into greener land use such as tree planting and agriculture (hemp for example can be a

huge industry for Aotearoa). There should be a ban on ICE vehicle imports and subsidies on electric vehicles - it is horrible to walk
down the street and breath in fumes that you know are causing negative health effects. And with an electric vehicle fleet our cities will

be quieter, calmer and more peaceful. Subsidise solar electric and hot water panels and house batteries. Investigate community
micro grids - can we get ride of some of the expensive national power grid lines that mar our countryside? Make housing more

affordable (tax the hell out of anyone with more than one house), set construction standards for insulation.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

The key things I support in a Zero Carbon Act are: A target for net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 should be in the Act. The
emissions from transport, industrial activity, agriculture, and all other sources should be included in the target. Even ‘short-lived’

gasses can have a huge effect on our climate and need to be reduced. Emissions budgets should be at least as important as fiscal
budgets, and the Government should set plans to achieve them. An independent Climate Change Commission of experts should

monitor emissions and give advice to keep New Zealand on-track for its emissions reduction goals.
