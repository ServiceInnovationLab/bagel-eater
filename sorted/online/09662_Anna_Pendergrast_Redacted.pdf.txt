Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Anna Pendergrast




Reference no: 9662

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 There should be some legislative requirements for government to demonstrate it is actively working toward this target, even if the
 target itself isn't enforceable.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes
 NZ should reach its targets first by reducing emissions domestically, then by offsetting carbon emissions domestically (including

 planting forest), then by purchasing domestic carbon credits, and only then (if not achievable by other means) by purchasing
 international carbon credits. There needs to be a real change in high-emissions industries to make this happen.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 No - all changes to reduce the target should have to go through the legislative process.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

 Position
Yes

Notes
Yes, there absolutely needs to be solid plans to support any target.




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

The term "innovation" is noted a lot as a necessity for being able to meet the targets. This is too vague and needs defining, especially
if you're thinking about things like geoengineering, as the public needs to be able to provide input on major proposals. As a zero net

emmissions plan is expected to result in a slower increase in household incomes, concerted effort should be made to implement
progressive taxation and to mitigate economic burden on lower income households & communities. The burden should fall on

wealthy companies and high income people who have benefited most from the high-carbon economy. Money should be set aside for
job retraining and culture change counseling for those likely to lose their traditional livelihoods due to the necessary ramp down of
some more polluting industries.
