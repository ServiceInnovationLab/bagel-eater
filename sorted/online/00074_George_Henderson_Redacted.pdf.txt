Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

George Henderson






Reference no: 74

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes
 Carbon emissions are more important than methane emissions, for reasons below



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived

 gases
 Notes

 Net zero methane emissions is an impossibility. Attempts to reduce methane by converting cows to plants may backfire as a) some
 plants, e.g. rice, are high methane emitters, b) rotting of plant waste is a methane emitter, c) horticulture is more carbon-intensive
 than animal raising in the NZ model. A tractor uses more petrol than a sheepdog.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes
 Carbon trading seems a fraudulent practice and is open to abuses in third world countries other than environmental abuses (e.g.

 driving off the livestock that feeds a people, or destroying their homes, to plant trees). However we do need overseas tradeoffs. We
 are farming ruminants to send milk and meat overseas. Therefore our per capita methane emissions are high, but this is because we
 feed so many people overseas. Therefore, per capita emissions are the wrong measure for methane, unless they are offset by

 overseas carbon saving.



 Clause
 Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

 Notes
 Cows may be polluting our rivers, but animal agriculture has not contributed to any of the increase in atmospheric methane for at
 least 10 years, Increases have instead been due to fracking, rice growing, and landfill. decomposition. Meat and dairy are far more

 nutritious than rice, landfill, or fracking. We should control the state of our rivers, but not stress too much about animals burping.
