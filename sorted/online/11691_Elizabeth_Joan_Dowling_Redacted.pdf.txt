Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Elizabeth Joan Dowling






Reference no: 11691


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 There have been too many delays already - lets get going - we only have 32 years from now and that's not long for making major
 changes in how we live on and view this land.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived

 gases
 Notes
 My personal preference is actually net zero emissions but with 44% of greenhouse emissions coming from agriculture, which is also

 still our primary industry, our target needs to be manageable and possible. This target could be adjusted to say reduced short-lived
 gases rather than stabilised.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 We need to meet this target for our own sake. My concerns are - 1. will government work with us to achieve this - e.g. could the GST

 be waived on electric cars on the proviso to make them available to more people and 2. how forestry is interpreted. Currently we
 seem to plant pine on any type of land without regard to terrain, soil retention or impact on waterways and downstream flooding after
 harvesting. I would like to see steep, highly erodible land returned to native forest with some areas on private land able to be

 selectively logged for fine timber but no clear felling. Waterways should always have WIDE buffer zones of permanent planting. We are
 the one's who need stronger environmental safeguards.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 It is important to have a strong target, Hopefully this will give both business and government the incentive to invest in innovative

 research.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 A little bit of policy stability would be nice!



 Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

But must be exceptional such as a major volcanic eruption!



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

People need to feel supported by their government so must create clear and unambiguous guidelines and clear statements about
what the government can do or not and what will be required of businesses and individuals.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
What areas will be targeted in each budget and who will be most affected? Some sector groups may already have ideas for emission
reduction - is new research needed - Can the Commission facilitate this? New technology - any available overseas? Are there low tech

solutions? Need government, business leaders and environmental experts working together so our solutions don't create new
problems




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
And must have mechanisms to hold the government to account. NZ governments have often ignored or just paid lip service to

environmental concerns.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Lot of words - sounds good but where's the action on the things we already know? e.g. Why are we still building on low-level coastal
ground? What actions will be required - e.g. to preserve essential infrastructure? The proposed risk assessment is very broad and

there doesn't seem to be any requirement for government bodies to have to take it into account in their planning?



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

We are all involved in this matter so community engagement is really important. Besides the cities, this must include rural and small
towns as we are already being adversely affected by high fuel costs, a lack of public transport and high travel needs for services and

amenities. We need to find better ways to talk about and to support our farmers while still holding them to account environmentally.
Please build systems that help people stay in work and not on welfare.
