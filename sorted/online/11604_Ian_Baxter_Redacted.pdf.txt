Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Ian Baxter, Ian Kenneth Baxter






Reference no: 11604


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 As an agricultural nation, and with 55% of our emissions being Methane and Nitrous oxide it is not credible to have a target that only

 focuses on CO2 reductions. From the economic modelling presented in the discussion document there is only minor economic
 penalty in adopting net zero emissions target, compared to net zero long lived gases.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes
 International carbon units should only be used to offset agricultural emissions and only where it can be shown that producing food in

 New Zealand produces lower emissions than producing food in the country where the international credits are coming from. For
 example grass fed beef generally produces lower emissions than corn fed beef. The emissions from any additional transport should

 be taken into account.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 Only under two circumstances. If the climate science indicates different targets would be more appropriate Unforeseen and
 significant event occur. The threshold for the government being able to adjust the target needs to clearly set out.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

That poorer people are not disproportionately impacted. Plans are seen as fair and equitable.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

The Commission should advise the government on targets and policy planning. The Government should have to publicly respond to,
and provide rationale when it deviates from the Commissionâ€™s advice. The Climate Commission should also act as an independent

watchdog, publishing progress reports and highlighting problems.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

The act needs to make it easy for local governments to publish hazard maps so that it is easy for people to see high risk areas. Need
to avoid the situation that happened in Kapiti recently where the council was forced to withdraw a hazard map because home owners

seemed to think a line on a map caused there properties to be devalued not the fact that the sea level is rising. What is needed is
national standards/best practise for risk assessment.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

In setting out adaptation plans/responses there needs to be a balance between building a collective community response and not
rewarding people who have ignored the risks of climate change. E.g. purchased a property near the high tide mark in the last

eighteen years.
