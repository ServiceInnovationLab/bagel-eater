Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Thomas Powell









Reference no: 10222

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes
 I believe that the government should set a target of net zero emissions of heat trapping gases by 2050 in the proposed Zero Carbon

 legislation. New Zealand is well positioned to achieve this goal, and setting it will show strong international leadership. With
 knowledge of the impending consequences of runaway climate change, we simply cannot wait for other nations to act. As thoughtful
 and capable people, we need to step forward and show leadership on this issue.




 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 I believe that the target should be net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050. This may be a difficult goal to meet, but
 including all greenhouse gases will provide equal weighting to various sources and limit the ability of the goal to be “gamed” by
 shifting one emission to another. It also has the potential of setting the standard for other nations.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 I believe that meeting these targets should be done using domestic emissions reductions only, including from new forest planting. If

 we use international carbon credits, I believe there is greater opportunity that our achievement in reaching these targets will be
 questioned. We have the capacity to achieve zero carbon though emissions reduction and tree planting in our own economy, without
 outside help.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes

 I do not recommend that the bill be written so that the target can be changed. We need to set a goal and stick to it. We fail in our
 endeavor for leadership on this issue if we allow ourselves an “escape clause”.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 The three budgets allow integration of commercial, technological and social changes, while also giving business and the ETS the

 future certainty necessary for forward planning.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes

 I believe that each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence. I do not believe that this
will unnecessarily weaken the national commitment. In addition, if the nation were to fall behind on its budget, the government should

be able to change the third target to keep the nation on target.



Clause

7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

From my viewpoint, the most important issue is how to mitigate the effect of the increased cost of emissions across the economy to
make sure that no groups are disadvantaged more than others.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

I believe that it should make the decisions itself, in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS. I believe this function
should be outside immediate political control.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
with mandatory reporting requirements.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this legislation. As a climate activist (Climate Karanga Marlborough) and retired
geoscientist, I think this is very important goal (net zero GHG emissions by 2050) and yet, will be very difficult for our society to

accomplish. I appreciate that citizen consultation is the best way to create a solution that will stick and (hopefully) will be fair to all New
Zealanders.
