Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Ashley Noel Hinton





Reference no: 2561

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 It is important that the government set a concrete date by which to achieve the necessary emission reductions so that the focus

 from now on can be on accomplishing these reductions. We cannot spend any more time renegotiating the time frame.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 The aim of this legislation should be to reduce emissions as a way of minimising the effects of climate change. If we target some
 greenhouse gases and not other we could end up doing a lot of good work which could be undermined by those gases left
 untargeted. It is important that the approach taken in this legislation take a view across all greenhouse gas emissions.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 Reducing emissions may be hard work, but it would be negligent of New Zealand to expect any other countries to shoulder this

 burden for us. New Zealand should aim to reduce its domestic emissions to reach its targets, but this should not preclude it from
 also helping to reduce emissions overseas.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Future governments should always have the option to take a more aggressive approach to emissions reduction, and should

 absolutely be permitted to commit to exceeding these targets.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
 its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 It is important that Government be publicly accountable to the recommendations and targets set by the Climate Change Commission.
The Climate Change Commission should be an independent public organisation, and should also act to communicate directly with

the public to advise of the progression of reductions, and to inform the public of the work being done.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes
It is important the Government act now to begin addressing the very real issue of adapting to climate change. There is no doubt that

the people of New Zealand will be dramatically effected by climate change, but these effects are unlikely to be uniformly shared
amongst the populace. The Government has a responsibility to those people who will need help in the coming to start planning this

help now. It is important that this planning not be delayed.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

The work we all need to do to adapt to climate change is work that is best shared by the whole country. Having a clear plan at a
country-wide level helps share the costs and expertise required in planning for the changes we have coming.
