Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Reference no: 12616

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes
 Lots of recent evidence suggests an urgency in developing pathways toward climate stabilisation – some accounts suggest such

 pathways need to be locked in by 2020 . Long-term predictability and transparency for all sectors is a prerequisite - it gives us a
 planned and smooth transition that minimises negative impacts on jobs, livelihoods and fairness.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 Given the recent evidence, our NZ Paris Agreement commitments, the broad co-benefits, innovation, opportunities, potential impacts

 (and their cost), and different time scales to reach temperature stabilisation, the most ambitious approach is necessary - all gases.
 Not only is it the right thing to do for future generations, it would be a strong driver for technological development, innovation and the
 development of incentives to ensure sectors like agriculture are supported in planning and alignment to the target. It's not really our

 "almost nuclear free" moment - it's the full deal!



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 I'd modify this a bit given that there's probably a need for some transition offsets as a last resort. But they should be used
 exceedingly sparingly. We should really take an 'invest in NZ' approach to harvest the co-benefits instead of buying our way to
 neutrality.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes

 Revisions would interfere with the predictability and transparency necessary to steer policy direction and likely result in slippage.
 However, I would support a more ambitious ratcheting up of the target, including one to emissions positive or earlier delivery (e.g.,
 net zero by 2040).



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Five year cycles help focus on action. They give some adaptability and agility in meeting targets.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes
 This is potentially a slippery slope. While I'd prefer no alterations, slight changes to emissions budgets should be taken quite

 carefully, and done frugally given the perceived and actual risks and impacts. Adjusting the third/final budget in the sequence should
be done sparingly and without pushing responsibility for emissions reductions into the future. Allowing such careful modifications of

the third/final budget may add some pragmatic flexibility but should only be done when the subsequent budget is set and with a high
degree of caution and frugality. We do not support adjusting the second budget – even in ‘exceptional circumstances.’




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
Plans should follow within a set timeline from budget setting.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Government should take into account a number of issues when setting plans, like: consideration for a just and equitable transition,

consideration of local government and urban needs, consideration of investing in New Zealand to gain a wide range of benefits
beyond but associated with carbon reduction, and consideration of offshore impacts and leakage.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
The commission should be given the right powers to enable domestic and international targets to be met against a carbon budget,

that it is placed outside political cycles, that it has a clear remit to support the work of local government and that budget and plans
are linked to required actions by local government, and that its work encompasses both mitigation and adaptation.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

The Climate Change Commission should advise and monitor New Zealand’s progress toward emissions goals as stated in the
Discussion Document. A full decision-making role in setting policy under its own authority at arm’s length from Government would

help drive evidence-based action, but it may carry the weight of an unprecedented transfer of traditionally government decision-
making. I suggest strong language in the final bill that urges Gov't to seriously and fully consider advice in its decision-making.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
And also add public health - an essential connection to make



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

Integrated solutions across both mitigation and adaptation can deliver smarter, better and multiple outcomes across well-beings.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Stay the course and be ambitious - it may require doing things that aren't supported by the majority in the consultation process. And

thanks!
