Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 12404

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 2050 is way too far into the future . New Zealanders need to be required to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions NOW - not in 32
 years time. Half of us will be dead by then. I have trucks sitting outside the supermarket across the road from my house with their

 engines going all day - the Northland regional council doesn't even have a policy on engine idling so I have no way to stop them. They
 ( industry and government ) are NOWHERE with this issue. And people ridicule me for caring. Our education needs to change from
 what the problem is to focusing on what we can do about it. Including engaging with our elected representatives to demand change

 and the means by which we can effect it. New Zealanders are very disengaged from the democratic process.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 BUT ONLY IF ( when ) it is shown that we need be acting with more urgency to bring emissions down.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes
 BUT ONLY IF ( when ) it is shown that we need be acting with more urgency to bring emissions down.




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 BUT ONLY IF ( when ) it is shown that we need be acting with more urgency to bring emissions down.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
BUT ... It needs to turn acheiving the goal of being greenhouse-gas free from being a pesky nuisance into being a desirable

aspiration for all parties. As a remote island nation that derives much of its income from primary sector exports and international
tourism, the people of New Zealand need to be made aware of the benefits inherent in making the change away from dependence

on and vulnerabilty to fossil fuels and to organic plant-based diets. Being seen to be a leader in this area will be of huge benefit to our
export and tourism sector and to our health, mobility , economy and the environment we live in.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Reduce consumption of fossil fuels : Bring in legislation to stop banks from providing loans to greenhouse gas producing activities (
e.g. loans to purchase car(bon burner)s. Bring in legislation to protect future renewable energy proposals from being bought up and
closed down ( e.g. as happened in 2013 when Todd Energy bought up Crest Energy's Kaipara Tidal Power generation proposal and

closed it down) . Carry out a nationwide study to identify the most appropriate sites for generation of renewable energies. Work with
Regional , Local Territories and their communities to implement micro-power projects . Change the funding regime for transport

projects to provide funding for the extension and electrification of ALL of New Zealand's railways and create a comprehensive high-
speed nationwide rail-based transport system. ( We're currently burning through $21,000,000 per day in imported fossil-fuels, so ,

yes, we can afford it. Put light-rail down the centre of all our motorways. Identify and actively promote conversion to horticulture ( away
from our traditional dependence on agriculture ) and promote the transition to plant-based diet. ( as per " Lesser consumption of
animal products is necessary to save the world from the worst impacts of climate change, UN report says" ) . Turners and Growers

wholesalers reported that we are only producing half of current horticultural products export demand.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes
Google : Cheat Neutral




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
Create a monitoring system so that New Zealanders can actually SEE where we are with progress towards achieving this goal. e.g.
data displays at EVERY petrol station to show how much carbon we - individually - and as a nation - are burning at that particular time.
