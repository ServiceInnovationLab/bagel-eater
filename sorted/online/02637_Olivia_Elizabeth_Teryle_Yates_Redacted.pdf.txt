Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Olivia Elizabeth Teryle Yates








Reference no: 2637

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 New Zealand should be held accountable for its emissions. New Zealand should do everything in its power to reduce emissions

 domestically first, leaving each national responsible for their own emissions.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 The steps taken to reach the target should be able to be revised due to unpredictable events (such a freak weather events) while
 the target of net zero emissions should remain fixed.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 This ensures overlap between terms of government, preventing successive governments from easily altering these budgets.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Only if all other budgets are adjusted accordingly to ensure that the target remains achievable (net zero emissions by 2050).



 Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Especially taking into account our obligations under the Treaty of Waitangi.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
A specific timeframe is needed to ensure that Governments uphold their commitments. The bill should require governments to set
out how it will achieve the emissions budgets, including transition pathways.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

the Government should set budgets in such a way that keeps the target achievable but minimises impacts on minority groups. The
transitions should be gradual to ensure that businesses and people group have time to adjust to the changes that are required.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

The Commission should advise the government on targets and policy planning. The Government should have to publicly respond to,
and provide rationale when it deviates from the Commission's advice. The Climate Commission should also act as an independent

watchdog, publishing progress reports and highlighting problems.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

New Zealand should not use the ETS.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

The proposed expertise roles should also cover experts on relations with our pacific territories, including on the effects of rising sea
levels on Niue, Tokelau and the Solomon Is.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Local government should be provided with clear directions and guidance. The Government should also help co-ordinate the

response across different sectors including iwi and hapu.
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

For the adaptation plan to be successful all available knowledge must be integrated, including that which is currently withheld by
organisations.
