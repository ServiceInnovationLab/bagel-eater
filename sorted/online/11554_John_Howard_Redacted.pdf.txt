 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

 Clause
 Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

 Notes
 NZ farmers are the most efficient farmers with the lowest emissions in the world. We still have to feed a world population, and should
 be encouraging countries with the lowest emissions to produce it. Also, Farmers who have shelter belts should be able to use them

 to offset emissions. Farmers who already run a low emission system should be recognised for doing so and not disadvantaged by the
current high emitting farmers should any measuring system be brought in. In other words those farmers that are changing now

should have credits for making monetary sacrifices now for the environment instead of pushing all the boundaries and reaping as
much financial reward before rules are brought in.
