Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Self, Lawrence John Carter








Reference no: 9250

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 The Ministry largely uses IPCC guidelines. There is however a significant body of scientific opinion which holds that the IPCC approach
 does not take adequate account of several factors including melting of Antarctic ice. In this case adverse effects of climate change

 may bite harder and faster than anticipated. There is a very good case for setting an earlier target date for zero carbon such as 2040.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 While methane is relatively short-lived in the atmosphere, its greenhouse effect is stronger than carbon dioxide, so it is essential that
 we include this gas in the plan. This is especially important (though difficult) for New Zealand to do.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 While it may be tempting to ease our position by buying credits from overseas, this process has been so discredited that I would not

 want to make this an option for government. I would like to see New Zealand set an example for other countries to follow, and this
 would be one way of doing so.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Notes
 If as many scientists fear the position is worse than IPCC figures suggest, it would be sensible to allow for the tightening or bringing

 forward of the emissions reduction process. I can’t imagine any situation in which we would all be better off by loosening the targets.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 It is important that the budget periods be longer than the average lifetime of government.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes
 Similar proviso as above. There should be the flexibility to tighten the budget if need be, but not to slacken it.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
Notes




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
See the climate change papers published by Engineers for Social Responsibility at www.esr.org.nz . It will be essential to liaise with
local governments which will carry much of the frontline responsibility.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

I’m ok with ‘advise’ provided that the dialogue between Commission and Government is published for all to see.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Notes
Not sure whether adaptation is best covered in this or separate legislation. Either way, we need a clear plan for dealing with the very
significant effects of climate change, some of which have been mentioned in the briefing document. We need to plan retreat from the

coastline, both for houses and industry but also for communication links such as SH6 and SH1 in the South Island. In the longer term
we need to look at large urban developments in central areas of both main islands.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

Implementation needs to be carried out sensitively.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
This is the biggest issue that we face, by far. It is essential that we join with other nations in reducing carbon emissions and preparing

for the climate change effects which are already inevitable. MPs need to know that they have our wholehearted support in tackling
these issues. They need to have the courage to take measures which may be unpopular in the short term, but are necessary for our

long term survival.
