Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Richard Joostens





Reference no: 11004

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes
 No process required , this is a meaningless , time wasting , money wasting proposal .




 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 No target required until the China , India , USA , and several others set targets , these governments represent around 3 billion people
 , about 45% of the worlds population .



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes
 Start counting all of the emission mitigating assets we currently have , starting with all native bush , it's likely we are close to carbon

 neutral today if this was done .



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Notes
 No need to revise anything , a Carbon bill should only introduced if the world can agree on a joint way to move in the same direction ,
 that's not close to happening , in fact the reverse is happening .




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 No
 Notes




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes

 Yes , If this unwarranted zero carbon bill becomes law , the government of the day must have the right to make changes without
 changes having to go threw parliament . The RMA is a classic case of getting it wrong , it needs changing but no political party can

 get the numbers to make change so we are stuck with something designed for a past era , another example in the USA , gun laws
 clearly need changing but again no political party can make the changes , they are trapped for ever . Don't make the same mistake
 here .



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 A government must have total authority to make any adjustments it feels are necessary under any circumstances .



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
Step one , the most important , ascertain what is really happening around the world before we do anything . A good starting point ,

what's China doing ?, no commitment until 2030 and no commitment to ever stop using coal . Currently Chinas emissions are on
track for their fastest growth in the last 7 years .




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

No
Notes

At this time we shouldn't have a zero carbon bill



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Important to check out what the rest of the world is actually doing , get real facts not the fairy tales . If we do this first and are honest
with those facts this bill will be filed in the rubbish bin .




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes

No role and NZ should follow Ontario Canada and scrap the ETS .



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

The ability to study , follow and understand what the rest of the world is really doing is the first essential requirement . An example ,
About 18 months ago China made much noise about closing coal mines , they closed them but forgot to tell anyone (or it wasn't

reported ) that 3 months later they reopened them . Trialled an ETS , this was designed to get industry to move into the country side
not to stop polluting , stopping polluting would have been financial suicide for China , they are going to grow richer at the rest of the
worlds expense .




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
The climate change today is no different to any climate change that's happened in the past , climate changes , that's what it's always
done , the only difference today is , today it's an industry , there is money in it .




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes
So far any actual climate change is at the bottom of predictions , far to many predictions have proven to be woefully inaccurate .




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
No

Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
World realities , Australia exports record amounts of coal , $57 BILLION last year , growth of 400 million tons in the next 15 years .

1000plus coal fired power stations planned for or being built now around the world , 423 in China alone . Not one European country
meeting it's Paris targets . Emissions skyrocketing in China at the moment , fossil fuels values have over taken over the tech industry

on the financial markets , almost a half of the world population has no commitment to cutting emissions , the UN climate fund chief
resigns quoting fighting over how the fund that we are going to paying $1 BILLION a year into is spent .(I guess that's enough for

starters) To finish , this bill is just an attempt by certain political partys to dominate our lives , put a noose around our necks for the
next 32 years for no good reason , what's actually happening around the world proves it's for no good reason .
