Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Ian McGregor Turnbull






Reference no: 10782


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 It would have been better if this had been done 10 years ago.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 This problem is URGENT!



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 Buying carbon credits from overseas is just avoiding our individual and collective responsibility - and they are too susceptible to being
 manipulated by the unscrupulous (like the last lot we bought)



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Provided it is only to bring it forward to 2040, when it is discovered just how bad the situation is!



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Notes

 Shades of Chairman Mao's ten Year Plans? Not sure on this one.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes

 As above - circumstances will change and even more reductions in emissions will become necessary, so flexibility is useful.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 For reasons in 6)



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
If no certain time frame is required, we may see yet more time wasted - as we have seen in the last few years.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
URGENCY! Government needs to work with (in particular) the Forestry industry - PLANT MORE TREES! With the transport industry -

more electric vehicles, more public transport. With the tourist industry - make every airline ticket sold have a carbon offset price of
10% of the ticket cost. All these things are known - get on with it!



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

Reluctantly - if the CCC has too much power, an idiotic Government might do away with it (shades of Donald Trump). Can we trust a
Government to heed advice?



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

Absolutely.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes
We don't have a great deal of choice. It is upon us already and we must adapt as well as trying to mitigate.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
Notes

Anything that makes people realise we are in deep trouble - already - and act to do something about it has to be good. Sharing
information is one of these things.




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

As a concerned and informed citizen with a scientific background, I have been taking steps to reduce my carbon footprint for over a
decade (going off-grid in 2000). It isn't hard, it doesn't mean vast sacrifice, and it can actually save money. It really annoys me to see

so many people just ignoring the crisis, hoping that "they" will fix it. We are all passengers on Spaceship Earth, and we are destroying
our life support system. If this Climate Change bill makes even a little bit of difference, our fellow passengers - all the other life forms

who had no say in creating our current mess - will thank us for it.
