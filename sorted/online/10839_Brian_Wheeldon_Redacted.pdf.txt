Brian Wheeldon








Reference no: 10839

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 Set a clear unambiguous target of zero net emissions latest achievement date 31st December 2049



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes
 Net zero of short long medium and all types of private,industrial, government, foreign based including embassies abroad.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 Must not be credit based, must be doable physically not bookkeeping or smoke and mirrors



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Notes
 NZ must move wholly into the next energy phase. Energy must be based on direct sunpower now not fossilized sunshine.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Notes

 Budgets have to be in place to work practicalit and not used in some later contrivance as an excuse as to why they weren't achieved.
 This is not vicarious economics. This is what matters and honesty matters not contrivance.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes
 What matters is scientific measurement and not what excuse politicians might find convenient. Real scientists must be in charge of

 the science and politicians must be held personally accountable.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Notes
 Politicians be held personally accountable for not holding to the science.



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Notes

 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

 Position
Yes

Notes
Based entirely on scientific data and advice not legal, political, financial session, only science data from qualified personnel in the

discipline



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

We need positive proactive consultative scientific personnel involved in key decision rolls at all stages

(NZ ETS)?

Notes

Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Provided the expertise is 100% scientific based as verified by climate science data.



Clause

Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Make it real, be honest, do not politicise, be inclusive, be positive, inclusive, and I will support it. Ps I spend 2 to 3 months cycling
around Europe usually their wild spaces and cities from Italy to Scandinavia. Most countries Talk too much and need to get on with

enforcing urgently necessary changes. Particularly Germany. It's no longer a debate. It is necessary action to be taken in the short
term 0 to 18 months. Much of Europe is likely to fail the challenge, there is too much self interest embedded in their systems and of

too many self interested people involved.
