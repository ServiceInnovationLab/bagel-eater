 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes
 We have no time to loose.



 Clause

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 Let's get in an early start.




 Clause

 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
 Notes
 Industry, Cars, Farmers. At this stage I feel most New Zealanders consider Climate Change not to be related to their lives or our

 country. It's something that happens to others. Maybe involving families and connecting it to the lives of their children could help. Why
 not make solar a must on new buildings? Why not push a carbon tax? Why not tax those massive four wheel drives heavier?



 Clause

 11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
 its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Get in the best scientists and work with their findings. Try and protect them so a change in government will not harm good work
 done.
Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Notes
Not sure - do one thing and do it well?




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes
