Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill






Reference no: 9739

Submitter Type:    Unspecified / Other

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 The government should take an independent and detailed look at the science behind Climate Change before making any binding
 policy decisions.




 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 Greenhouse gases are likely NOT the main driver of any change in the climate. Therefore any legislation that focuses on and targets
 them is misplaced. Emissions targets therefore are not useful for the purposes for which they are proposed and will prove both
 wasteful and pointless.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 Rather than blindly relying on the politically motivated pronouncements, reports and publications issued by the IPCC, New Zealand
 should make up its own mind based upon facts and sound evidence. No emissions targets are necessary.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Given it is likely in my view that the current IPCC position on climate change will be proven to be misinformed, and assuming this bill

 were to go ahead, it would be prudent to allow for changed circumstances.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 No

 Notes
 No, in light of my previous points, I don't believe that emissions budgets will have any benefit.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes
 As the real climate drivers become more obvious, any incoming Government would be well served by having some flexibility regarding
 emissions.




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
Yes

Notes
They are sensible!




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Notes

Obviously any meaningful bill would have budget time-frames, but its whole basis is fundamentally flawed in the first place.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

They need to be sure that greenhouse gases are in fact driving climate change before enacting any such legislation. My belief is that
our climate is primarily driven by solar cycles, solar activity and solar interactions with our ionosphere, atmosphere and

magnetosphere. Any impact derived from greenhouse gas emissions would be irrelevant to the overall climate picture.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

While these functions appear reasonable, they are all presupposed on the theory of greenhouse gas driven climate change and
therefore erroneous.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
If they will in fact have the capability to offer "independent expert advice", then hopefully the may be able to illuminate our government

as to the real climate change scenario.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

I don't agree that we need a Climate Change Commission, and it looks like any such people would without doubt be biased towards
the IPCC position. Therefore they would be unable to offer any truly independent, expert advice.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

It doesn't take too much research to see that there is an entirely different and much more valid perspective by way of explanation for
any changes we may perceive occurring to our climate. I urge decision makers to investigate for themselves prior to making any
costly policy decisions. While there are many websites, documents, videos and other forms or media that I could upload or link, the

one I chose to attach called "Groupthink" is a good starting point. For goodness sake, read and absorb it. I do not wish my name to
be published.
