Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 1149

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 Aspirational



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 Clean up our own act where we can monitor and control effectively



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Change will continue unavoidably



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 Don't be last minute dreamers



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
Too complex to comment




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
See later




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes
Monitoring is too big a job for the Commission and the function would compromise the Commions independence. It should critique

the monitors.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes

Don't agree with the ETS. It will generate much churning, consume resources that would be better spent incentivizing improvements.
taxing emitters better.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
Depends on whether monitoring is to be a Commission function




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

We alone will barely influence CC and must deal with reality- not some ideal.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

See high tech comment later



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

I know there is no silver bullet to fix CC. Nevertheless long term gains will come from the high tech sector and we must stay up with
innovations and the govt must have resources to contribute and incentivize. Among the many technologies that are fast evolving in

China and India is nuclear thorium. The word nuclear is toxic politically in NZ but we must change that when Thorium technologies
evolve. At present our regulatory environment condemns everything vaguely nuclear and fails to distinguish between environmentally

safe and unsafe. Potentially Thorium plants could: Be scaleable down to units the size of shipping containers thus eliminating
kilometers of high voltage transmission lines and our whole national grid The energy could benefit the whole economy and replace
gas generation It can make safe nuclear waste It can produce rare earths as a by product and break China's monopoly on these

products that are so vital for high tech solutions It could provide abundant power for our future green transport and all the other uses
we have for it. Tree planting is e temporary fix. Reducing emissions is long term. Given abundant electrical energy we could clean up

our farming and industrial emissions too.
