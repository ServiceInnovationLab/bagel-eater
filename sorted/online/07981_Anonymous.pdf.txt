 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No
 Notes

 Clause
 12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

 (NZ ETS)?

 Clause
 13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

 Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

It needs to be completely science based. Unless we take strong steps now, the economic consequences will be catastrophic,
therefore better to take shorter term pain for more longer term mitigations

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Many societal ills such as obesity and the health consequences of that are created as a consequence of consuming ultra-processed
foods. Going to zero-carbon will inevitably remove ultra-processing of food and thereby contribute to fixing the environment. Many

aspects of becoming carbon-neutral will correct other problems.
