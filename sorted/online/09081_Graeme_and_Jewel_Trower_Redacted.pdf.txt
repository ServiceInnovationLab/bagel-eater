Reference no: 9081

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 The current data is only based on models that do not include the whole picture, ie pastural grasses. The climate science is also bias

 due the funding system, in that any science against politician's will result in a lose of funding. Any science funded by industry against
 what the climate change commission is said to be biased and thus rejected, but this is not the case in reverse. Ã„nimals should not
 be included unless the increase in human numbers is also included for the same reasons.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Carbon Dioxide - Reducing net carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2050
 Notes
 The best targets are to reduce man made carbon dioxide emissions - also remember life would not exist with out greenhouse gases.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 By understanding the actual science versus the pollicatical and environmental unscientific people views based on biased science
 due to the funding system ( ie scientific people lose their jobs if they go against the tide)



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 But only if it is specified.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes

 This is really just an economic rebalancing act and is not actually going to reduce emissions.



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Notes
This is really just an economic rebalancing act and is not actually going to reduce emissions.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
No
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
That the science is balanced, and the data is actually correct, before putting costs on that make the farming industry pay for

sometime that is not correct. Also need to understand that life cannot exist without greenhouse gases. So only the man made CO2
should be included, not gases produced by animals or humans. If you include animals, then you also need to include humans as our

numbers have increased considerably, where as the animal numbers have not increased.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Only if it is to do with man made emissions, and is not bias against anyone particular sector.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes

Should not be environmentalist with a set position already.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Should not be environmentalist with a set position already.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
Over the thousands of years the climate has changed without man's interference. One large volcanic eruption could plunge us into

an iceage, we need to be adaptable, and careful. Indeed one large earthquake can raise or drop the sea level in minutes.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Over the thousands of years the climate has changed without man's interference. One large volcanic eruption could plunge us into
an iceage, we need to be adaptable, and careful. Indeed one large earthquake can raise or drop the sea level in minutes.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
No
