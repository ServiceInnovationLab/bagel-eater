Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Caroline Davies





Reference no: 1808

Submitter Type:

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 There is no time to lose. Although I understand that you wish to make this massive shift wisely, and bring everybody on board, with

 the continuation and increase of carbon output into the atmosphere, and the fact that it has taken hundreds of years to get to this
 point, and we are seeing the kinds of impacts already affecting many people (including Insurance Companies) 2050 seems a long
 way away to begin any kind of serious and committed reversal. I feel the matter is urgent, and that is an understatement.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 If every country takes responsibility for their own area, then trading carbon units would not be necessary.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Yes because there are still unknowns and I anticipate extremely severe weather patterns to show up. Some flexibility should be
 included in regard to emergencies, and also to potential innovations that may possibly emerge.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Generally speaking yes, as that gives time for budgets to be implemented. Some flexibility might be wise to allow for unanticipated,
 severe emergencies from serious weather patterns.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes
 But really, that depends upon the wisdom, intelligence, and courage of any incoming Government. It's a hard one to answer.




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
