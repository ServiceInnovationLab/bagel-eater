Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Mairi Jay, Mairi Jay (Mairi Jay)








Reference no: 12263

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 While long-lived gases have greater long-term effects, human civilisation has to survive in the short term.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 Businesses and the NZ public need certainty and transparency. Domestic emission reductions are easier to see and enable greater
 trust that everyone is doing their bit.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 There should be no extensions of the target but if circumstances indicate that reductions need to be made faster, the target could
 be shortened.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 In my view the advantage of the 5-yearly periods is that they straddle the political 3-yearly cycle and encourage bipartisan
 government.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes
 The government should have plans and timeframes which make changes that are consistent and understandable with an overall

 framework.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
Yes if technological advances allow for more effective emission controls and the government wants to speed up the adoption of

improved technologies or management systems.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Apart from the considerations set out on page 44, the Commission needs to consider the impact of a decision on SOCIAL EQUITY
and IMPACTS, INCLUDING POSSIBLE BENEFITS, TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND INDIGENOUS BIODIVERSITY.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

The plans need to be made public and should provide guidance for local and regional governments under the Resource
Management Act or replacement legislation.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The Government needs to work with private sector players such as farmers and the transport industry but also with local and regional

government.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

I would like to see the Commission as one that has a strong Advisory role, with mechanisms built in to hold Government to account



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes

Don't know



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

I agree with the areas of expertise indicated on p. 45 but IN ADDITION, THE COMMISSION NEEDS EXPERTISE IN SOCIAL IMPACT
ASSESSMENT.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes
YES. Adapting to climate change is the critically relevant parallel to reducing emissions. For example, reduction of greenhouse gas

emissions from agriculture will require major changes in agricultural practice at the same time that agriculture also has to adapt to
changing weather and climate.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes
In addition to the elements indicated on page 46, I think the government will need i) A PRO-ACTIVE EDUCATIONAL AND ADIVISORY

ROLE - which could be a purpose designed element of the Climate Change Commission or sit somewhere in the Ministry for the
Environment; and (ii) I think it will need an AGENCY TO CO-ORDINATE DISASTER RESPONSES. There are going to be more events

where communities are completely overwhelmed by flood or drought or other weather related disasters and need assistance to get
back on their feet.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
I consider that emissions reductions in GHGs as well as adaptations to climate change will involve major changes to land use and

urban development. For that reason, I suggest the following changes to Part 4 of the Resource Management Act, Functions, powers,
and duties of central and local government: o Minister for the Environment: add the duty to prepare and update a national adaptation
plan, the plan to set targets for emission reductions of CO2, Nitrous Oxide and methane; the plan to be reviewed and up-dated at

intervals of not more than a 5-years; o The Minister for the Environment to monitor and publish the results of emission reduction
actions and targets every 2 years. o Regional councils: add the duty to prepare regional adaptation plans in close cooperation with

district councils, iwi and central government ministries (for biosecurity, primary production and health) o Regional councils: to include
CO2 targets and nutrient limits in regional plans; o Regional councils: insert a requirement of regional transport plans an aim to

reduce transport modes based on fossil fuels and optimise other modes of access than the private car. o District councils: require
district councils to incorporate subdivision regulations that maximise access by walking and/or cycling. o District Councils: encourage
district councils to maintain and up-date codes of practice for subdivision, residential design and land development that specify best

practice.
