 Notes
 or earlier. Situation is urgent and existential threat to our countries ability to earn from our landbase.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Carbon Dioxide - Reducing net carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2050

 Notes
 methane is short lived and will reduce in shift to biologically soil based agriculture and away from chemical farming.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Position

 Yes

All sectors. priority is to shift transport and phase out ICE engines, electrify, cycle ways and public transport. Regional council
requirement for cycling protected pathways and e bike lanes. Agriculture must be included with shift to biologically based farming

practice to capture benefits on scientifically validated improved nutritional content in food, improved environmental outcomes, soil
conservation and optimising soil carbon levels in soils mostly for production benefit but also carbon sequestration. This approach

also drives up the value of our agricultural production. We can only produce enough food for 30 million or so people, why are we not
selling to the top table?

The farmer representation group must include farmers who have experience of biological farming and the scientific background to
explain and demonstrate it. Prof Christine Jones and Dr Beverly Trowbridge would be a good start.
