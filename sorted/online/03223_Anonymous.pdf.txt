Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 3223

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 It needs provide certainty to everyone (including businesses wanting to invest in emission reduction technologies). It should be hard
 to change and be able withstand short term changes in political environment or as a knee jerk reaction to external factors.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 My least preferred option is limiting the target to Net Zero Carbon Dioxide only. Even without the need to mitigate climate change,

 export market preferences and externally driven technological advances (eg plant-based and lab-grown proteins) have the potential
 to significantly change our land use over the next few decades. This reinforces the need for NZ to prepare for, be ready to adapt to

 changes in land use. In other words even if we choose a lesser emissions reduction target its likely our land use will still significantly
 change. In my view we'll be better placed in the long run to factor in low emission land uses into this. NZ's land use has not been
 static over time (eg at a localised level the shift from farming to vineyards in Hawkes Bay, and the change in Havelock North away from

 apple orchards to increased urbanisation, and at a national level reduced sheep farming and increased dairying.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 I think it will be necessary to include high quality ICUs in the mix, but this should be done in a manner which doesn't undermine the
 drive to reduce domestic emissions (i.e. the ability to use these, or the extent they can be relied on should be capped and/or
 reduced over time). The criteria on pg 33 of the consultation document make sense to be adopted. Need also to improve

 environmental management and oversight of forestry operations, particularly in high risk catchments (such as Gisborne,
 Nelson/Marlborough). The public need to have confidence in the shift to substantially increasing forest plantings isn't going to be

 detrimental to the environment overall, or come with its own costs for infrastructure repair and remediation costs falling on LG and
 ratepayers).



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 I'd prefer to say maybe. If the ability to allow change is agreed to, it should only allow it under very limited circumstances. It must not
 undermine certainty the business community needs.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
Notes




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes

Adaptation needs more direction from central government and greater coordination across different levels of government.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes

Notes
Any reporting function should be set up in a way which is simple and cost effective - needs to be minimal costs imposed.




Clause
