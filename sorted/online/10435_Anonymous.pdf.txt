Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

I would like to see industries that contribute to pollution taxed more heavily, and that way companies that are trying harder to reduce
emissions will become the norm and those that aren't are sieved out. I would also like to see more endorsement in public transport
especially rail, i live in Tauranga the public transport is terrible, only buses are available and they suck, not reliable, people will not

switch from driving if this is the case. Train system like in Auckland and Wellington would be great to see in Tauranga especially since
the population is spreading further out into rural areas. I would love to see more endorsement in electric cars/trucks, maybe a trading
in fund to help people ditch their old cars and swap them for something clean and green, this could be repaid by tolling roads, which

in turn would also promote public transport use as an alternative for people who didn't want to pay a toll. Also i hope that we are able
to meet our target for methyl bromide recapture technology by 2020! or just stop using it. And the dairy industry seriously needs to

be reduced its just not good enough, if we endorsed green alternative such as HEMP! that could take over dairy revenue and create
multiple industries, the possibilities are almost endless.
