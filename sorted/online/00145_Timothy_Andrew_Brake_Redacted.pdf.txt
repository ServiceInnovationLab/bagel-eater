Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Timothy Brake, Mr Timothy Andrew Brake (Timothy Brake)








Reference no: 145

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes
 First we must be absolutely clear what the target actually is. We must understand the difference between short cycle carbon and long

 cycle carbon. The target must be for zero Long Cycle Carbon



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes
 This cannot be net it has to be zero. ETS is a fraud in that it cannot provide long term sequestering of Long Cycle Carbon Dioxide.

 The forest owners will not be throwing the trees in a swamp! With a pine tree life of 28 years on average it only offers 14 years
 sequestering. Once harvested depending on use the long cycle carbon dioxide will be returned to the atmosphere as long cycle
 carbon, just because it has been through a tree does not change this. Return times will vary from about 6 months for toilet paper to

 100 years for building. There is currently no commercial long term sequestering for long cycle carbon emissions. We need to accept
 this and move on. I am all for increasing the bio mass of the planet (apart from humans) but to add this to any equation is woolly
 thinking. If we had adopted ETS immediately it was developed all of the Carbon Dioxide will have already been returned to the

 Atmosphere!



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 Don't count on the tress see above



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 While we have already set in place 24m sea level rise in the next 2500 years or about 1m/year it will be storms or heat waves that will
 strike us first and will be the only thing that will galvanism public opinion sufficiently for more that just tokenism and more studies.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Rolling commitments will be a start but government funding wont be enough



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes

 They are going to do it anyway, so it will be politically naive to propose otherwise
Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes
But as they are well outside the political cycle it will be pointless




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Education. we need to understand what we are trying to do and communicate it to all members of society, as we will need everyone's

active co-operation.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes but not at the expense of actually doing things



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

The ETS is a fraud and needs to be dispensed with it is not going to help us achieve our goals and will in fact delay us further. Also
methane emissions from agriculture, the elderly and landfills do not contribute to Long Term Climate Change. They are part of the

short carbon cycle and must be treated as such. As long as we have distractions form the real issue holding us back we will never
make real progress. Like food in the solid waste debate, it is a smoke screen to the real elephant in the room - Synthetics. Food is
not a solid waste and our grandchildren will not thank us for or food diversion efforts. Like ETS we are moving more of the tonnes

onto them!



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

But there must be a very high bar to minimize "Green-washing". Classical Sustainability is essential a fraud too, where so called
sustainability programs are essentials "we were slightly more sustainable than we would have been if we had not bothered".




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes not as much the sea level change that is slow but the weather resilience.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes

Notes
As long as it was not green-washing and box ticking exercises which they currently are.




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

It is already too late we are going to have to adapt to the new equilibrium's. However we have a chance of stopping it getting
excessively worse. The plastics in our seas will also be around for centuries and we need to help as much of our fellow Flora and

Fauna survive too if we can or at the end of this we will be alone.
