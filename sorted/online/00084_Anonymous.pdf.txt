Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill








Reference no: 84


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 The science tells us that the time to act on greenhouse gas emissions is now. Hence we need to set a target for 2050 in law.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes
 The main problem is runaway climate change by every increasing amounts of GHGs in the atmosphere. Under stable emissions of
 short-lived gases, there would eventually be no further increase of their abundance (because of equilibrium between emission and

 loss). This does not apply to CO2 because of its very long residence time in the climate system.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 International carbon credits notoriously suffer from a credibility problem. I think we should achieve our emission reductions at home,
 by emitting less.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 The only way which I can see a change may be needed is to bring the date forward. That should be possible.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 The budget needs to come with policies that ensures that the targets are met.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No
 Notes
Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
Absolutely. The aim is worth nothing if not backup up by a realistic plan.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
What are the low-hanging fruit? A lot of measures that we should roll out today not only help climate but would also generally improve

our economy, such as electrification of transport, decentralized renewable energy production etc. The measures need to be a
balance of the positive and the negative, i.e. restrictions balanced with incentives to change behaviour.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

The ETS can play a key role in meeting the Paris commitments, but likely the price of emissions has to increase for that.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

Ideally the CCC comprises a balance of scientific, economic, and political expertise.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
Mitigation and adaptation are related but significantly different fields of activity.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
Learnings of how best to cope with climate change should indeed be shared efficiently, also internationally.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

New Zealand has long been considered a kind of political avant-garde and social laboratory of the world. Climate change offers a
prime opportunity to reclaim this position. Please be ambitious.
