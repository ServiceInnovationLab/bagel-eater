Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

David Lloyd





Reference no: 12391

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes
 The Government need set no emissions targets at all, as emissions have a negligible effect on the climate. According to NIWA, NZ

 temperatures have been rising at about 0.01 degree per year for 100 years. The rest of the world is similar. According to Stats NZ, the
 sea level has been rising at a negligible 1.5mm per year for 100 years.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes
 No target is necessary as emissions are not significantly changing the climate, according to plenty of scientists around the world..




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 No target is necessary as emissions are not significantly changing the climate, according to plenty of scientists around the world..



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 No target is necessary as emissions are not significantly changing the climate, according to plenty of scientists around the world.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 No emissions budget is necessary as emissions are not significantly changing the climate, according to plenty of scientists around

 the world.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes

 No emissions budget is necessary as emissions are not significantly changing the climate, according to plenty of scientists around
 the world.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 No emissions budget is necessary as emissions are not significantly changing the climate, according to plenty of scientists around
 the world.



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Scientific knowledge about climate change must be taken into account. The present government scientific advisers have not done
so.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

No
Notes

No emissions budget is necessary as emissions are not significantly changing the climate, according to plenty of scientists around
the world.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The Government must NOT send any money overseas in an attempt to pay for "carbon credits". If money is available to be wasted in

that way, it should be spent on making streams cleaner.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes
I fear that the present Climate Change Commission are not capable of advising on scientific matters. Their assertions that CO2 and

Methane are changing the climate is wrong, according to plenty of scientists around the world.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Notes
The NZ Emissions Trading Scheme should be abandoned, as it is based on the nonsense that CO2 and Methane have a significant
effect on climate, when they don't, according to plenty of scientists around the world.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes
The Climate Change Commission should get advice from overseas experts who are sceptical that CO2 and Methane have a

significant effect on climate.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
No

Notes
The term Zero Carbon presupposes that Carbon is a bad thing, when in fact CO2 is a colourless trace gas essential for all life on

Earth. 99.9% of all carbon is now contained in limestone and sediments at the bottom of the sea. It is nonsense to try to minimise the
tiny amount of carbon elsewhere.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
NZ should abandon support of the Paris Agreement. NZ should monitor and mitigate erosion on coastlines




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Notes
More accurate information is needed on potential inundation from storm events. Auckland has had only three major flooding events
(1936, 2011 and 2018). Some poorly built roads have sunk and become flooded. They should be fixed. Poor drainage needs to be

fixed. None of that is anything to do with Zero Carbon.
