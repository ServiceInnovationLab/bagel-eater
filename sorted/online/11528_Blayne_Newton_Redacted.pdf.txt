The climate has been changing since the beginning of time. Carbon is needed for vegetation to grow. ONE coal mine in Australia puts
out as much carbon as NZ does in a year. Our carbon emissions are a fraction of 1 percent of the world total. If this goes ahead, the

virtue signalling will send the country broke. Virtue signalling is effectively all this is doing
