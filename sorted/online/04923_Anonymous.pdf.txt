Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill











Reference no: 4923

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 New planting of trees should not just be for a short-term profit. Native trees and both native and exotic hardwood plantings should be
 encouraged.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Only if we are already meeting the targets and the pace of change can be increased. This should not be able to be used to water
 down any targets.

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position

Notes



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

This is an urgent matter for the whole planet. We should be bold - make proper targets given the current scientific knowledge - and
work to the more pessimistic forecasts. Stop pandering to destructive industries (fossil fuel, animal farming). Make polices to help

those who will need to change how they work. Encourage the take-up of solar, wind power and electric cars; and encourage
innovation in these areas which can be used world-wide (business and education). Be a world leader on dealing with climate change.
