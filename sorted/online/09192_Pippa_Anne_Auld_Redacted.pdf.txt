Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Pippa Anne Auld








Reference no: 9192

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 After nine years of total inaction on climate change it is urgent that the current government sets some binding legislation in order to
 insure a path to emissions reduction among other environmental issues.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 We must set ambitious (but achievable) goals, in order to set an example for other OECD countries in the Paris Agreement but also as

 a matter of urgency regarding the education and awareness of the NZ population- by setting clear goals as a country Kiwi's will be
 encouraged to examine areas of their own life in which they are negatively contributing to our current environmental crisis. NZ has

 the opportunity to become a world leader environmentally and setting this target would not only stay in line with the Paris agreement
 but it will help centre environmental issues, but it will emphasise the importance of climate change and government alongside
 traditional 'jobs and growth' concerns.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 There are many foreseeable problems with allowing the purchasing of international emissions reductions, and it should be avoided at

 all costs as NZ is an OECD country with the ability and resources to achieve a carbon zero target on it's own.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 Presumably the only circumstance in which the bill would be revised would be in order to soften targets. There is argument regarding
 whether or not adhering to the Paris Agreement will in fact successfully mitigate climate change temperature rises to only 2 degrees-

 above which resulting sea level rise, ecosystem damage, and weather conditions are considered to be largely catastrophic and
 unknown. We cannot take risks beyond what has been budgeted for by the Paris Agreement.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Five years is a good interval as it will not run in line with the election cycle.




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes
 See no. 7
Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Assuming that each government carefully plans for and takes advice from appropriate sources to formulate action second budgets
should not need to be altered. As part of climate change mitigation planning government should be prepared for the increased

likelihood of natural disasters and there should be strategy in place to deal with shocks and stresses that are likely to effect our ability
to meet emissions budgets.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

There should also being a guideline regarding the wellbeing of people and place, including consideration of inter-generational equity
and environmental justice.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes

There should be strong frameworks in place to ensure that planning for and the implementation of actions required to meet budgets
continue regardless of who is in government.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
- Social, economic, and environmental equity for all New Zealanders and our natural environment. - Transition to low carbon

transportation networks - Supporting the agriculture industry to transfer to a low GHG future - Community engagement and education
- Investment in low carbon industries- job creation




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Minus international emission reduction advice. The climate change commission should also monitor and advise of social issues

arising from low carbon transitions, climate change and community mindset and education



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Community engagement, communications and EDUCATION



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
We are already locked in for at least 1.5 degrees of climate change, it would be remiss to not include adaptation in the bill as disaster/
emergency planning, infrastructure safeguards/ repairs and healthcare many other factors are likely to cost NZ a lot of money as a

highly coastal country. There in fact a lot of ground to catch up on after nine years of underfunded public sectors across the board.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Risk assessments need to be ongoing as science and probably futures change.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
The more information accessible to the government regarding economic, environmental and social vulnerabilities brought about by

climate change the better prepared the country will be to adapt to and mitigate shocks and stresses.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

It is a relief to finally see some tangible action being taken by government on this issue! NZ contribute a very small proportion of
global emissions but that does not in anyway excuse us from action, especially considering our high per capita emissions and
emissions that are likely incurred offshore in relation to our own consumption. It is time NZ lays out a pathway to a positive and

environmental regenerative future to work towards and ensure the future liveability of our country and planet.
