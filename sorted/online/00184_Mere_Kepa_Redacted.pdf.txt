Reference no: 184

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 The coalition government must set a target for 2050 in legislation now.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 The most ambitious target is reducing total greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050. The last election saw Maori turn out to support
 the Labour political party and help to return them to govern the nation. The obvious conclusion is that Maori prefer the direction of

 Labour’s policies under the new Prime Minister.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes
 By using only domestic emissions reductions as well as including information for the new forest planting being promoted by the

 Honourable Shane Jones.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Notes

 The 2050 target should not be altered in response to market place as this undermines the certainty of the Act. However, the ability to
 revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific and Indigenous understandings or international agreements should be

 considered.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance so that 3 are in effect at all times.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 The proposed emissions budgets should not be altered in response to the market as this undermines their certainty. However, the

 ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in scientific and Indigenous understandings or international agreements should be
 considered.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

The 2050 target should not be altered in response to market place as this undermines the certainty of the Act. However, the ability to
revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific and Indigenous understandings or international agreements should be

considered.



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes
I agree that the coalition government and the climate commission should take the following factors into consideration when advising

on and setting budgets: Indigenous Maori knowledge and [western] science.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes
Yes, the coalition government must learn from their own mistakes as well as international mistakes; for example, the mistake of the

UK's Climate Change Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets must be environmentally sustainable and should reflect a commitment to
the Treaty of Waitangi (Article 3, at least), the theory of partnership and the spirit of the Treaty, and UNDrip. Otherwise, the plan would

require the government to re-define the Maori treaty rights which would leave intact individual property rights, unrestrained
exploitation of resources, maximisation of private profit, and the supreme authority of the prevailing state.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
The Climate Change Commission must not be the decision-making body.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
The Commission should advise the coalition government on policy settings in the NZ ETS.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
I agree that collective expertise and wisdom is essential and desirable. Begin by respecting the human rights of the original
protectors of the land. Indigenous Maori people have been at the forefront of protecting the rivers, coasts, forests and lands from

out-of-control industrial activity. The coalition government is able to strengthen this role and reset our relationship by implementing, at
least, Article 3 of the Treaty of Waitangi, the theory of partnership and spirit of the Treaty, and the United Nations Declaration on the

Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The development of a Zero Carbon Bill must draw on the wisdom that, “(i)f you wouldn’t want it in your
backyard, then it doesn’t belong in anyone’s backyard” (Kline, N. 2017).




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes. This will require an adaptation [Maori] sub-committee within the Climate Commission.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

I would agree if the Indigenous Maori people’s ideas and lived experience was supported.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

nil



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
While the global economic model is failing the vast majority of people on the planet, it is not failing all of the people the same. I want to

recommend that the coalition government considers UNDRIP and the Treaty of Waitangi and that a Zero Carbon Act adequately
engages the human rights issues that arise from the fossil-fuel industry; that is, the right to clean air to breathe and clean water to

drink, now and for generations to come.
