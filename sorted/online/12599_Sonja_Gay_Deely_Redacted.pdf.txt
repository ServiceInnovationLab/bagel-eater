Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Sonja Gay Deely








Reference no: 12599

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No

 Notes
 But it could be changed to make the goals stronger, only if with the right input from Climate Commission and approval by Parliament.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 This needs to ensure that with a change of government we don't lose the targets and budgets associated because then it could
 weaken this. We must move forward and take this on 100%




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No

 Notes
 Generally no, don't want the emissions targets to be reduced so there is a chance if a different government was to get in and wanted
 to soften them. There would need to be signficant barriers to changing and probably would have to come from the Climate

 Commission to submit for a change, and then an act in Parliament.



 Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Implementing them. Making sure they happen. That they work with MƒÅori and honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi, that the plans are fair, and of

course include environment and sustainability as main components.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

It's really important that the Government is held accountable to meet the goals and that an independent authority does that.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Maybe infrastructure planning and effects of climate change on local regions, high tides etc. Also some knowledge of the wider
region - the Pacific




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
If adapting means responding to and addressing changes that occur over time from climate change - or potentially from climate
change. We have to be able to manage what happens as a result from taking so long already to respond fully to this massive issue.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
Notes

We must know the full and open risks that are occurring or expected to occur. Information is power.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
It is about time NZ put this kind of action into place. I am thrilled that we are putting into place the targets for zero carbon by 2050...

and if possible to make it happen sooner. This is the most critical issue facing humanity, and we must also ensure that we look after
those who can least do so. We must lead the way and all do more than our fair share to make it easier for all. THANK YOU.
