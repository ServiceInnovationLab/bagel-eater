Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 11723

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 Setting the 2050 target now is faster and creates long-term certainty of climate action through accountability.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived

 gases
 Notes
 Ideally long-lived gases are reduced past net zero to negative by 2050, and short-lived gases are reduced to sustainable levels.

 Policy would be based on scientific understanding of long versus short lived gases. The agricultural industry, whilst not having to
 bring methane to net zero, would still need to reduce Nitrous Oxide to net zero.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 Relying on International carbon credits to reach net zero allows us to put off reducing an extent of our carbon emissions, which is

 what we are trying to avoid. It allows domestic reductions to be less ambitous and thus we lose out on the benefits of transitioning
 early.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No

 Notes
 The entire point of the bill is to provide accountability and long-term certainty which we can all plan for. Flexibility is provided by the
 many pathways NZ can take to achieve that goal. If it can be revised for economic changes, than that accountability and long-term

 certainty is weakened. Therefore it should only be revised under exceptional circumstances, such as significant change in our
 scientific understanding of climate change, or world war three.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes
 Being able to revise a budget that is already set would weaken the accountability and long-term certainty which is necessary for a

 smooth transition. It should only be revised under exceptional circumstances.



 Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Again, only under exceptional circumstance like a large earthquake.



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

Having a timeframe focuses energy into making policies that will achieve the emissions budgets.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Plans need to align with Te Tiriti o Waitangi.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

An advisory role is perfect. If it was a decision making body, than it would be difficult to keep it accountable as those positions are not
democratically voted for.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
