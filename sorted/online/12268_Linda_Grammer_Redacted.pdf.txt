Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
1. Climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing people in poverty in New Zealand and in developing countries. It would be

unethical for NZ to ignore the impact climate change is having on our neighbours in the Pacific and across the developing world. 2.
Climate Change is a global problem – it cannot be tackled by countries in isolation. In our farming families view, New Zealand must

demonstrate global leadership and match its bold domestic emissions reduction agenda: by having an equally ambitious climate
change strategy abroad. 3. Access to climate finance is a matter of climate justice – those who have contributed least to the causes
of climate change are typically the most vulnerable to its impacts and have the least resources to respond. This is unacceptable and

must be remedied. 4. We must take responsibility for our global emissions and the climate impacts that we have contributed to. It’s
very important that all New Zealanders have their say on how we make the shift to a zero carbon future here in New Zealand but in

our view we must also help the world’s most vulnerable communities across the Pacific adjust to the impacts on climate change. 5.
We must ensure that the Zero Carbon Bill is transparent. This means the bill must include a requirement to produce annual reports

about New Zealand’s international climate change contributions in order to ensure that the Pacific countries get the support they
need and can plan to adapt to their changing environment. 6.Transparency in the Bill will promote public engagement and political
accountability. Kiwis will then be able to understand the international contributions we are making and as a nation, we will be able to

stand tall that we are supporting our Pacific neighbours adapt to their climate change reality. 7. It is time for New Zealand to lead
again. We have a history of global leadership: we were the first country to give women the vote, the first to become nuclear free and

we have no commercial GE food crops or animals, no cloning of animals. We have a valuable ZERO TOLERANCE Policy for any GE
content in imported seeds, including adventitious presence.. It is time to take another giant step towards climate justice globally. 8.

New Zealand has demonstrated global leadership with our commitment to stopping oil and gas exploration – now let us continue that
moral leadership and include transparency in what and how we support climate change efforts abroad. 9. We ask that the Zero
Carbon Bill prioritizes supporting the most vulnerable people in the Pacific. 10. NO new coal mines in the North Island or South Island.

We support the Minister of Conservation Hon Eugenie Sage's recent excellent decision, DECLINING the application by Stevenson
Mining Ltd/ RAngitira Developments Ltd for a new open cast coal mine on public conservation lands (in an Outstanding Landscape,

above Westport). The Stevenson Mining LTD/ Rangitira Developments proposal for a new open cast coal mine in the Buller District
Council "Water Conservation Reserve" (approximately 100 hectares) and on our public conservation lands (12 hectares) must be

stopped in its entirety. It would increase the Bullers negative contribute to climate change, put the town of Westport and the Buller /
West Coast in general- particularly but not limited to coastal communities already experiencing severe erosion- further at risk from

violent storms. We support the new government putting a ban on all new coal mines. In our view, ensuring that existing mines are
operated to best practice standards, and that full robust remediation is done to best environmental standards, will retain and create
ethical jobs (during the period during which we transition to safe and clean, renewable energy). Thank you for the opportunity to

make a submission, I wish to be heard at any hearing that may occur. Thank you!
