 Notes
 I do not believe the proposed Act will do anything to alter the climate. For every piece of science that says human activity influences

 climate, there is a piece of science that says it does not. It is fundamentally flawed and the costs to the economy and to our lifestyles
 will outweigh any perceived benefits.
