Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Eileen Wright,






Reference no: 5461


Submitter Type:    Community Group

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 Climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing people in poverty, here in New Zealand, in the Pacific and across the
 developing world. It is a global problem so New Zealand must match its bold domestic emission reduction agenda by an ambitious
 climate change strategy abroad.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 We need to take responsibility for our global emissions and the climate impacts that we have contributed to. We must achieve Net

 zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Notes
 I want the requirement under the Paris agreement that New Zealand communicate its international contributions to climate finance to
 be included in the Zero Carbon Bill. This would involve providing the balance between funding for mitigation and adaptation projects;

 whether the public climate finance would be new money or money in addition to current aid to the Pacific; who would be the
 recipients of climate finance; what would be the mechanisms of the funds. Therefore domestic and global emissions must both be

 addressed in the best ways available to us.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes

 Definitely not this would be an unnecessary loophole. These must be avoided at all costs.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 This is the transparency that would ensure successive governments are accountable, and would promote public engagement.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 Determination to meet set targets, requires consistency.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
Notes

The Zero Carbon Bill must require annual reports about New Zealand international climate change contributions to ensure our Pacific
neighbours know what they would receive to be able to plan for adaptation to their changing environment. Regional Councils would

also need annual reports on regional finance to plan for adaptation to their changing environments. The annual reports need to be
built into the emission budgets.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
The only consideration for setting budgets is to make sure iwi, hapu, Regional councils, and Pacific neighbours have climate finance
to meet net zero emissions by 2050 and to plan for adaptation to their changing environment.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
Only concrete plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emission budgets would build confidence for the electorate.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Access to climate finance is a matter of climate justice for, Iwi, Hapu, Regional Councils and our Pacific neighbours, therefore they all
need consideration in setting plans to meet budgets.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
The Climate Change Commission should advise the Government and monitor their progress towards net zero emissions by 2050 but

the Government should be answerable to the Commission if they deviate from the advised pathway.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Notes

I would like to see them ban NZ ETS, it only pretends to cut emissions.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No
Notes

I would like to see equal numbers of each gender, the majority of whom are Climate Change Science Experts. Two Economists one of
each gender, to advise on emission budgets. Four Experts in Emission Free Technologies, two of each gender. The chairperson must

be a Climate Change Science Expert. Other experts could be added once my original cohort has been met.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
Adaptation must be included in the emission budgets so Net Zero Emissions are achievable by 2050 without unforeseen hiccups.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes

I think that organisations and individuals could report to iwi, hapu, and Regional Councils on climate change risks, and they would be
reported back to the Enviroment Ministry for action.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

As a member of Oxfam NZ and a grandmother of four small granddaughters I think it is very important that future generations grow up
knowing we cared about limiting emissions to NetZero by 2050, and cared about our Pacific and global neighbours.
