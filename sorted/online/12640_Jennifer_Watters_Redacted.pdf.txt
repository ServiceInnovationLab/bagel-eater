Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Jennifer Watters






Reference no: 12640


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 We need to do as much as possible, as fast as possible and encourage / incentivise the economic market towards low Carbon

 solutions



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 Emmissions trading detracts from rapid reduction to a zero carbon / negative carbon solution



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 Only if we need more stringent measures, if there was ever a New Zealand equivalent of Donald Trump in the future we need to safe
 guard against and make it exceptionally hard for sucessive governments to change environmental safeguards.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 It seems sensible to work in that time frame.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 Again as previous statement only if the requirement needs to be sped up / more stringent.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
 Unless to become more stringent.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Allowing any system / process to be robust however easy to administrate. Ensuring appropriate budget is placed aside to assist

those Councils in implementing this and encouraging quick innovation solutions through challenge funds (which are simple and easy
to apply for and administrate - yet ensure accountability).




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes however if it's advisory can the Government disregard the recommendations? - there needs to be a robust process to ensure

that all the time and money put into a panel is not wasted by Governments being able to ignore the recommendations from the
panel.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
They must have tried and tested experience, with an emphasis on integrity.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
I think adaptation is necessary however not in this bill.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
I strongly believe that this is the most important peice of legislation of our time and needs to be a well thought out robust peice of

legislation that assists in moving us quickly to a low / zero / negative Carbon society and that the lessons and innovation we create
must be shared with other poorer countries, so that they can quickly move in that direction whilst raising the standard of living for

their people.
