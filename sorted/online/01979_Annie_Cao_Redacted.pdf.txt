Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Annie Cao









Reference no: 1979

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 I support taking a science-based approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible: we should aim for
 negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. I support moving away from agriculture as

 the foundation of our economy. We need to be investing in industries that are of higher value and do not cause environmental
 destruction within our own country.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes

 I consider a small amount of emissions reduction credits from overseas can be used. However there must be cap on the volume of
 credits that can be used. I suggest this is a small amount of around 20%. The majority of the effort has to be domestic reductions.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
 ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific understanding or international agreements should be permitted.

 I consider the target should only be revised if recommended by the Climate Commission.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.
 However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in scientific understanding or international agreements should be

 permitted, or in exceptional circumstances such as a natural disaster.



 Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

There should be a fixed % that the budget can be revised by - for example 20-30%. Revisions to the second emissions budget must
also not impact on the ability to meet the last emissions budget.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
The Commission should be advisory but must be able to hold the Government to account.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
Any national risk assessment / adaptation plan must be lined up with the RMA. We need to make more use of national directives in

the RMA - NPSs and NESs and not leave it to individual councils to make ad hoc rules on adaptation. Where Councils have zoned land
as prohibited for residential activity to mitigate against flood risk, I do not consider it is appropriate that individual home owners should

be able to challenge those Council decisions.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Thank you to MfE for all the hard work they have put into the Bill and the consultation process.
