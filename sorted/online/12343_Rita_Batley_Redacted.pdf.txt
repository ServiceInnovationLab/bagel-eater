Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Rita Batley, Rita Maria Batley










Reference no: 12343


Submitter Type:    Business / Industry

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases
 Notes

 The term "net' as defined by the discussion document is not satisfactory. It does not reflect a true net value for the biological
 processes involved with pasture growth, soil carbon sequestration and native plantings. This is of major concern and needs to be

 addressed.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes
 The environmental safeguards will need to be very robust, and the use of international carbon units should only be used during the
 transition phases to assist with continued financial viability of industry, but not as a permanent solution.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
But defining 'exceptional' now must occur so that a change in government can not use the promise of changing budgets as an

election campaign strategy.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

But a bunch of headings is not very informative.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Must work with major stakeholders, especially the primary producers. B& L NZ must have a leading role in representing the situation
for sheep and beef farmers. They have developed an interim implementation plan that is sound. Recognition of the gains already

achieved by the sheep and beef industry since 1990.“We’ve reduced Sheep numbers from 57.9 million to 27.6 million and beef cattle
numbers have declined 23%. Absolute greenhouse gas emissions from sheep and beef farms are 30% below 1990 levels while the

sector’s contribution to GDP has doubled to $5 billion. GHG emissions per kilogram of saleable product have dropped by 40% and
nitrate leaching per kilogram of saleable product has declined by 21%. The electricity generation in New Zealand needs better
management and transparency. The drive to be 100% renewable is noble, but wind energy is grossly overstated as being strictly

renewable with its reliance on fossil fuels for rotor maintenance and the devastation and degradation of sites where the raw materials
are mined. To ignore the environmental impact of this mining because it occurs overseas is not true to the spirit of global partnership

in dealing with climate change. Our improvement in reducing carbon emissions should not be at the expense of other countries.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

But advisers can be ignored by the government.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes

There needs to be a strong agreement between the government and the commission regarding decisions, so I partially agree that
the Commission needs the ability to make decisions.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
With such an emphasis on agriculture, surely the Commission needs to have professional expertise in this area, which does not

appear on the list.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
No

Notes
This should be under the umbrella of the Commission.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Forestry plantings are not without issue as seen by the devastation caused by heavy rainfall in the Tasman and Gisborne areas that
were recently logged. Sheep and beef farms cover diverse landscapes, with numerous trees scattered across them. Many of these

trees – whether they are shelterbelts, riparian plantings, erosion management plantings or blocks of native vegetation – are not
counted in the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). Need to quantify the total carbon sink on sheep and beef farms (both inside and out
of the ETS) Nearly half of all QEII National Trust covenants are found on sheep and beef farms (47%) and the area of sheep and beef

land protected under QEII, Ngā Whenua Rāhui and other covenants is growing but not included in the ETS. The contribution of
carbon sequestration made by pasture and soils needs to be included in determining net carbon emissions on pastoral farming

systems. Without including these, the figures generated will be anything but a true. To assert that this task is too difficult is defeatist
and sloppy. Sheep and beef farmers have made meaningful improvements to their environmental performance and lowering

emissions and they deserve credit for these gains.
