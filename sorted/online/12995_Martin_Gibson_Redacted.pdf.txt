Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Martin Gibson








Reference no: 12995

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 Before taking any action to interfere with the national economy or the lifestyle of its citizens, the government should provide

 irrefutable proof that human production of carbon dioxide in New Zealand is harmful to humans or any other lifeforms in New Zealand.
 Any action should be weighed against the cost of adapting to climate change, and the need to improve resilience to cope with
 temperature decrease.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 Disengage from the globalist Marxist scam.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 What sort of nutcases would specify “no”? Oh right, the ones we have in government.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 No
 Notes




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
The welfare of New Zealand’s environment economy and people. The $1.4b pa would be much better spent protecting EEZ and

restoring waterways.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
About 13 years ago I wrote a series of columns in The Gisborne Herald expressing doubt about the validity of the famed “hockey stick

graph” as a predictor of future climate. Time has vindicated my cynicism - a result of a university degree in Earth Sciences. Virtually all
climate models have grossly over-estimated warming yet as a nation we are still following this international Marxist scam. Adaptation

to inevitable climate change, including likely cooling, is a far more sensible approach, but that won’t help our treacherous politicians
and technocrats secure lucrative roles at the UN.
