Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Brent Barrett








Reference no: 1496

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 there is real urgency to move aggressively to abate emissions



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 there is real urgency to move aggressively to abate emissions - all gases!



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes
 good to take a global approach, may be cheaper to offset some overseas emissions than to scrub the last few emissions out of our

 own patch



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 only to bring it closer; i.e. not to delay it.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 yep, and needs to apply to local government as well.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
 Notes
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

must include local governments as well, and DHBs



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

actually achieving emissions reductions, putting a strong requirement on local govt to set carbon budgets at local level; i.e. to pattern
the central govt approach at a local authority level.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

gets this essential function somewhat removed from the political realm, therefore much greater assurance of success.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes

this should be dealt with in seperate legislation. adaptation is a response to global emissions and complex biophysical feedbacks.
abatement is focused on about domestic emissions, so should be in a stand alone statute. while it should be seperate legislation for

adaptation, it needs to be a nationally coordinated approach, and have a compulsion on local govt and sector level planning for
adaptation.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
essential, especially for local government and private sector.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

I wish to speak in support of my submission at any hearings or select committee process that arises in this consultation process. I
believe this is the most important legislation considered in the 52nd Parliament. Need to take an exponential decay approach, i.e.

biggest decreases in emissions in early years, moderate in mid years, and slower in last years. There needs to be a strong
compulsion on all local govts in NZ to set and deliver on these budgets as well; otherwise you'll get all sorts of cross boundary
failures to set appropriate strategy and planning in place at local level. Many Councils are in denial. For instance Horizons Regional

Council was presented with numerous submissions during the 2018 Long Term Plan consultation that lay out the rationale for setting
a GHG emissions abatement target. A subsequent recommendation to establish such a target was only briefly considered, and lost

10-2. Without compulsion on local govt, there will be a major and dangerous lag in delivery on the NZ budgets.
