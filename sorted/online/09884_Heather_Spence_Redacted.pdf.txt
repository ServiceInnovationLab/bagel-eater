 Notes

 Notes

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Plans need to be detailed, costed and budgeted right down to the people who carries them out. If govt leaves plans as broad polices
that are not turned into action plans, they risk remaining as lofty management jargon and nothing will happen. Cost, budgets, need to

consider this essential downward direction. They need to mean real stuff to the person who has to do it. And cost of
accountability/compliance must also be budgeted for. Poor compliance means plans/efforts are wasted. NZ is poor at setting targets
then not monitoring compliance.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

Advising govt would be OK if there are mechanisms to hold govt to account. There would need to be a means for ensuring govt
accountability. Some past govts would have ignored unpalatable advice, no matter what rules apply. A CCCommission that could make

its own decisions has the potential to become too full of itself and powerful.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

But it also needs to be supported by the skills and abilities to would enable its policies to be translated into practical working plans, to
demonstrate that its advice is sound and practical, etc.That is, it's not just commissioners, it's also the support personnel that enable

the commissioners to be effective.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Congratulations to those who wrote this clear document. If the Commission for CC have this clarity of intent and if govts act on their

advice, there's hope. And congratulations to all political parties if agreement on working together on this can be achieved. What a
gigantic job ahead - seems that many govt plans will need to take a back seat. Thanks.
