Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

                   Jo Ann Firestone






Reference no: 7599


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes
 Let's set a goal to Net Zero Emissions on all greenhouse gases after we acheive net zero long lived and stabilized short lived by or
 before 2050.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 ONLY if the target date needs to be revised back (ex: 2040 instead of 2050) or if a Climate Change Commission recommends more

 urgent cutbacks and reductions.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 UNLESS there is strong evidence to support an increased budget. Protections should be in place to not cut them.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 My note above ties in with this.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

Absolutely and there needs to be a government watchdog body measuring achievements or lack of achievements



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Most importantly a Climate Change Commission would hold governments and industry accountable. We really have to get this
don...time is not on our side.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

I think a CCC can do both - set standards for government to implement and advise government on policy



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
Essential




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
On March 2017 I became a grandmother for the first time. My granddaughter was 8 weeks premature. Doctors do not know why my
daughter in law didn't carry to term. My granddaughter is a survivor and at 16 months she is developing in the prem spectrum. A little

behind, but doing fine. Now, her family is concerned about the survival of New Zealand. Finally, with everything we know as fact about
the warming of the planet and our oceans, we have a government that is working towards solutions for my future and my

grandaughter's future. Last February, we had 2 hurricanes (I prefer to call tropical cyclones hurricanes) rip though our Tasman Bay
destroying 2 iconic, waterfront buildings. The REASON these hurricanes went South instead of their typical Northerly direction is

beacuse the Tasman Sea was 6 degrees warmer than "normal'. Now, Nelson/Tasman residents need to learn about hurricane
protection/survival. The new norm. Including adaptation is essential. Having a Climate Change Commission that is part of government
forever...a new government can't come in and undo it is also essential.
