Reference no: 5274

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes
 It is important to take a science-based approach to ensure our emission reduction efforts are as impactful as possible. This means

 recognising the difference between long-lived greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide) and short-lived
 greenhouse gases (such as methane). We call this the “two baskets” approach. Applying a two baskets approach to achieve a net
 zero 2050 all gases target would mean: •Combining long-lived gas reductions with carbon sinks (through forestry and carbon

 sequestration in soil) to achieve negative long-lived emissions by 2050; and •Reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 The Zero Carbon Act should be met through domestic emissions reductions only. We call this the “firewall principle”. Relying on
 international carbon credits (even if the credits have integrity) creates uncertainty about what reductions need to be achieved in New

 Zealand. It also means we are investing in other countries’ low emission transitions, rather than our own.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 The 2050 target should only be revised in exceptional circumstances. The purpose of the Zero Carbon Act is to provide
 accountability, certainty and flexibility. It will provide accountability and certainty by setting clear, legally-binding emission reduction
 targets. It will retain flexibility by permitting different governments to use different policies to meet these targets, in response to

 changing circumstances and new technology. Despite the importance of accountability and certainty, there are some situations
 where it is appropriate to change the 2050 target. For example, if there is a significant change in scientific knowledge or international

 law (such as the Paris Agreement becoming more ambitious). Any revision should require input from the Climate Commission and
 approval by Parliament. Generation Zero does not support being able to revise the 2050 target in response to “economic changes”.
 This would create uncertainty, which means more econ



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes
Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Under exceptional circumstances, yes. For example, it might be appropriate to change an upcoming budget after an extreme natural
disaster (such as a major earthquake). Revising a budget in this situation would not mean changing the long-term 2050 target. To

provide maximum certainty and accountability, budgets should not be revised unless the circumstances are exceptional. See Q4 and
Q6.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes. A weakness of the UK Climate Change Act, on which the Zero Carbon Act is based, is that the UK Act does not set clear
timeframes for the government to make policy plans to meet future emission budgets (which are set 10-15 years in advance).

Generation Zero supports the Zero Carbon Act having a strict time frame for setting out policy plans. This time frame should be 6
months after an emission budget has been set.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Desirable, but non-essential, expertise could include: •business competitiveness •knowledge of the public and private innovation

and technology development system.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
