Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Carsten Bockemuehl





Reference no: 2433

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 It is important to be as ambitious as possible. There is mounting evidence that the upper temperature goal of the Paris Agreement
 (“2°C above pre-industrial levels”) would be a dangerous step for humanity. Climate legislation should reflect the need to pursue

 efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 Allowing the 2050 target to be revised is potentially dangerous and undermines the concept of long-term planning certainty. The only

 exceptional justification for altering it would be a significant disruption e.g. in the scientific understanding of climate change.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 One additional factor that should be considered is the effects of climate change in developing countries, especially in our Pacific

 neighbourhood, and the likely impact of the decision on New Zealand's relations with Pacific partner governments as well as
 reputation and credibility in international fora.



 Clause

 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

It is important not to overlook the fact that climate change is a global phenomenon that disproportionately affects developing
countries, including in our own Pacific neighbourhood. Our plans for ambitious domestic-facing action should be matched by equally

ambitious plans to provide international climate change assistance. To that end, New Zealand should be working closely with Pacific
governments, regional bodies, civil society and international NGOs helping local communities adapt to the impacts of climate change.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

The Climate Change Commission should also include expertise to monitor and report on New Zealand's international climate change
contributions under the Paris agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. It would be valuable to see the Commission draw

attention to the issue of how New Zealand provides climate-related support to developing countries e.g. via climate finance for
adaptation and mitigation, particularly in the Pacific. As such, the Zero Carbon Bill should include a requirement for Government to

produce regular reports on New Zealand’s international climate finance and climate-related Official Development Assistance.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

As above: At least two Commissioners should be able to monitor and provide expert advice on New Zealand's climate action in
support of developing countries. This would require them to have in-depth understanding of international climate and development
frameworks as well as climate policy priorities in developing countries, especially in the Pacific.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
For enhanced policy coherence and coordination, the Zero Carbon Bill should also outline / reference New Zealand's efforts to assist
developing countries, including in the Pacific, adapt to climate change. It would be valuable to use insights from and decisions for the

National Adaptation Plan to inform New Zealand’s international assistance to vulnerable people and countries, and vice-versa.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

As above, developing a National Adaptation Plan and Reporting Power is a key opportunity to review, improve and align New Zealand's
adaptation support to developing countries in the Pacific (and beyond).




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback. As outlined above, I would again like to highlight that the Zero Carbon Bill is a
unique opportunity to ensure that we contribute to a positive future in developing countries who are among the most vulnerable to

impacts such as changing weather patterns and sea level rise. As such, the Bill should include strong references to New Zealand's
international commitments under the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement, notably Articles 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 on

developed country support to developing countries, particularly in the area of adaptation. The Climate Commission could play a key
role in monitoring and strengthening our contributions in the global fight against climate change. A national adaptation plan could
include policy guidance on our adaptation support overseas. In short, please ensure the Zero Carbon Bill will not only drive

meaningful climate action at home but also across the developing world.
