Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Mary Caldwell, Mary Frances Caldwell









Reference no: 8540

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes
 Hopefully this target can be reached sooner than 2050



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 BUT it is essential to differentiate long lived and short lived gases ( a two basket approach) in policies. Short lived gases can be

 brought down rapidly at the start which benefits us in the interim years to 2050 .



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 we need to take responsibility and manage our own reductions , initially with the short lived gases.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 no but can be if revised down ., changes as a result of revised international agreements backed by science (IPCC)



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 but allow for sooner to improve plans in response to new research findings to avoid better alternatives to b dismissed for up to 5

 years .



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes

 if motivated by science not politically or economically motivated /pushed by lobby groups. The Commission would need to fully
 support the change



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
Notes

Climate change is the most exceptional circumstance to warrant continuing on this path no matter what.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

yes but only on "how to" achieve the target and budgets , not changing the target and budgets .



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
most definitely, Time frame a maximum of 3 months to set out a plan .




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Well being of the people of NZ .




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
I don't have enough confidence that all future governments will follow advice from the commission. We have seen many examples

where advice eg from the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment has not been followed . I can see a balance where some
recommendations can have an advisory status while others won't in which case the commission decides. The commission needs to

be adequately resourced including budgets to carry out the work ,access to MfE resources , ability to initiate their own research or
commission peer review . The Bill needs to require that the government makes these resources available .



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
plus impacts on health




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes

The Bill and subsequent implementation plans should provide clear direction for local councils .



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes
