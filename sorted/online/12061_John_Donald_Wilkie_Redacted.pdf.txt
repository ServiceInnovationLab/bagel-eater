Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

John, JD Wilkie (John Donald Wilkie)








Reference no: 12061

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Carbon Dioxide - Reducing net carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2050

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 International carbon units have proved unreliable in my opinion.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Definitely.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Notes
 All budgets should be subject to re-assessment.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes

 Under all circumstances.



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Notes

I am seriously against any form of emissions trading.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No
Notes

Why the emphasis on Maori representation? I say this as a livestock farmer with a supposed 49% emissions stake in the game, and
no apparent representation on the Commission. I am also 1/4 Maori with a whakapapa extending back to Hawaiki in 21 generations,

which makes me more Maori than most claimants of that ethnicity and more than happy to embrace the NZ citizenship inherent
under the Treaty.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
I am concerned there is no account taken of burgeoning world population. Very little attention has been given internationally to the

likelihood of zero food surplus by 2050 if the projected 11.5 billion mark is reached. Every ha locked into forest might be an ha lost to
food production. Currently my family farm is 20% larger by area but carrying 20% lower stocking than when I left school in the early

1960's, but in that time the population of NZ has doubled. I resent the proposition of having to kill my animals so somebody else's
grandchildren can keep breeding indiscriminately.
