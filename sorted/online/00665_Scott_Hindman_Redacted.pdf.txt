Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Scott Hindman









Reference no: 665

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes
 It is important we set a goal now, so that we begin to make changes now, otherwise sectors that see change as negative for them

 will hold up and delay the process until the 2050 goal will look unachievable. Enough talk, let get doing!



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 We need to be ambitious and go for the best outcome. Even if we only partially succeed it's better than not trying to do our best.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 Aotearoa NZ needs to do this not only for the health of the planet, but also for marketign value for our products. Therefore we cant
 continue to pollute and simply buy our goodname. We need to walk the talk and lead the way. We need to be able to sell our NZ made

 products as coming from a zero emissions country.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes

 If it's too flimsy then it wont mean anything. We need a strong target that will force companies and communities to change asap. As
 the target gets closer people will need to do more.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Five years sounds like enough time to see decent change and adjust budgets for the next 5 years.




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 Emissions budgets should only be able to be changed if they are going lower. For example if the country is more than on track and
 can do better, then adjustments can be made. BUT it is important that future governments cant alter a budget that would make it
 less likely that we will make our 2050 goal.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
The government should always be able to adjust things under exceptional circumstances. However it should be an independent

board that decides if this is indeed an exceptional circumstance. Simply not agreeing that the 2050 goal is realistic or good for
business is not an exceptional circumstance. It should also take a 75% vote from parliament to make any change after the
independent board confirms it is a exceptional circumstance.




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes
Timeframes are important. We need to get moving on this.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
Working with everyone that is effected by each change is important. Sometimes it will be impossible to get peoples support for

change, but this is about our survival on this planet. The government needs to make bold decisions that will benefit everyone now
and in the future. Changes we make now will make big differences for people not even born yet. We are caretakers of this life support

system we call our environment, and we have a responsibility to pass it on in a usable state to future generations.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
The government should have the final say, but they should by law need a really really really good, well researched and scientific

reason to disagree with and not follow recommendations from the commission.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

We need people who know what they are talking about on this commission. AND they need to be accountable.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
It is all related, so taking a holistic view of the problem will give a better outcome.
Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Adapting to, and doing what we can to reduce climate change is the most important thing facing humans in our lifetime. We have

been handed a HUGE problem by our ancestors, and it has fallen on us to deal with the issue before it becomes "unsolvable" with
disastrous outcomes for us and future generations. We should have acted 100 years ago. We must act now. It is URGENT. The

economy and business and the public in general will not be able to tackle this themselves. It needs strong leadership from
government to do whats best for it's people. And that is to create an environment that humans can survive in for the foreseeable

future. We also have a role to play on the world stage, developing and sharing solutions, and leading the way to show what can be
done, with a little number 8 wire kiwi ingenuity.
