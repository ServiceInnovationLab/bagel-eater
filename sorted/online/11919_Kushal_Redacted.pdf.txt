Notes

I know you tree hugers think you are important and doing something great, you should go after global polluters and stop countries
like USA who didn't even sign the treaty or accept global warming. You are wasting people's time and money here in NZ on your

stupid ambitious and idiotic ideas. This money could be use to fight poverty, warm houses and provide better health services to
people.
