Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Samantha Hoskins








Reference no: 9478

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 Dependent on the support required to pass the legislation - however I believe it is the governments responsibility to act now and
 believe there is enough information to hand for the government to make the decision



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 The report highlights the scale of innovation and change required, but also the opportunity this offers New Zealand to create new
 industries and jobs. We should seize this opportunity with both hands, rather than shipping some of our responsibility off shore.

 International collaborations should focus on sharing innovative approaches and technology, not reinforcing inevitable power
 imbalances between countries.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 No

 Notes



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes



 Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

I would like to see an inclusion of cultural impacts and a focus on environmental circumstances and adaptions.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The role of civil society will be vital in ensuring ground swell support behind the budgets. This will drive private sector engagement,
but also help the general public to support changes required to meet budget. The agriculture sector is vital. Understanding how

innovation can be used to provide opportunity, so budgets can offset change with opportunity. Budgets must be bold and brave and
ensure equity across all sectors. Finally, a there must be a focus on inequality and how the budget will mitigate the inevitable
imbalance across society.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
I would suggest moving 'innovation' from desirable to essential.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
No
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
It is time to be brave and put in place policy and structure that leads the world, seizing the opportunity this point in time provides us
to change our course.
