Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Frank James McGuckian








Reference no: 2539

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 Climate change is not a major problem for NZ. While the climate may change slightly ie, the seasons move a little as they have done

 this year with an early arrival of winter.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 We do not need a target to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. What we need is an effort to process our rubbish more efficiently. This
 includes an real effort to recycle more components of the rubbish we do produce.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 There is no way we need to buy international carbon units . To do so would be to support the UN in its desire to run a one world
 government.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No

 Notes
 Not needed



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 Not needed




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No
 Notes




 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No

 Notes
 Climate change in terms of the world heating up as a result of what humans do on the earth is a total myth. The earth has gone
 through many changes of heating and cooling. If we really want to know what is happening then we should ask God when the climate

 will change. After all God created the earth and each one of us on it. I am sure he will have the plans and blue prints if only we ask.



 Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
No

Notes
The Government should focus on how we care for the earth in terms of rubbish disposal and how we protect the earths resources,

and how we care for all the peoples living all over the earth.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The Government must adopt a more pragmatic approach towards all people living in NZ and not be distracted by those who follow
ideologies based on "gender" ,"diversity" or "race"



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
Climate Change as introduced by the UN is a myth, backed up by the creation of computer models which are designed to back up
the nonsense of demented scientists and supported by unquestioning media.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes
No role whatsoever. We do not need a Climate Change Commission and we definitely do not need an Emissions Trading Scheme in

NZ.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No
Notes

What we need is a Government which is prepared to govern. After all we have a group of 120 who are supposed to do this. The
concept of appointing committees and enquiry groups, in addition to the staff of all Government departments, is nothing more than

confirmation of their inability to govern.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
Climate change is nothing more than a computer generated model.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
Clean up the rubbish problem and protect our natural resources.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
No

Notes
If the current bureaucracy cant handle it they should not be there.
Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Not at the moment.
