Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Vivienne Mary Kerr






Reference no: 12096


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 Everyone needs certainty in planning for the future. Whether it is businesses deciding which energy source to use, or households
 saving for an electric car or solar pv.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 Methane & Nitrous oxide, while not lasting as long in the atmosphere as CO2, are powerful greenhouse gases and they would have a
 significant effect on global warming in the coming decades if not reduced, preferably to net zero.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 Soil and plant carbon sequestration will have a role to play, but it is critical that there are genuine reductions in all New Zealand's

 emissions of greenhouse gases. Purchasing overseas credits could defer action to actually reduce emissions here and could
 become a huge expense to the NZ taxpayer.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Only in exceptional circumstances if a change in the international consensus on the science of climate change occurs. For example, if

 a new agreement (similar to the Paris agreement) is ratified. Economic changes should not be permitted as a means to weaken the
 target.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Everyone needs certainty as to what is required.




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 Other than in exceptional circumstances- see Q4



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
Yes

Notes
In exceptional circumstances, as long as it did not change the long term goal of net zero emissions in all gases by 2050




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Also need to add expertise in health effects. Climate change is a direct threat to human health, so knowledge in that area is required.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

Actual plans are urgently needed so that everyone can start to make the changes that are required to rapidly reduce emissions of all
greenhouse gases. 12 months should be enough time given the years of background work that has already been done.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Fairness and equity to all New Zealanders. Fairness and equity at an international level. New Zealanders are high per capita emitters

of greenhouse gases and we must share the burden of reducing them fairly with our fellow international citizens.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

The comission would be appointed, not democratically elected, so should not have actual decision making powers. All reports and
communications from the Climate Change Commission to the Government should be publically available at the time they are made.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
Adding health expertise




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes

But adaption planning should be done by a separate body other than the Climate change commission, so that a very strong focus
remains on actual reduction of greenhouse gases




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
