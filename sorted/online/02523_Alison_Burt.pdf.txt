Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Alison Burt






Reference no: 2523


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 We do not have time to delay as the effects of climate change are happening now.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 All gasses are affecting climate change. Methane produced by ruminants must be included as they are such a huge contributor of
 our total greenhouse emissions



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes
 Also there should be support of, and perhaps reward for green technology and innovation. Change to electric vehicles and support

 for vehicle sharing, cycling and improved pubic transport.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Yes but only in reducing it sooner if innovations prove effective or if climate change progresses more rapidly



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Yes in giving time frames clearer goals can be targeted and reached. Each time frame also allows for resetting of budgets to ensure

 the 15 year goal is reached.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 See first note



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
Yes there needs to be some flexibility due to unpredictable changes in economy, science, technology, natural disasters




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Livestock Farmers - to assist with reducing methane emissions, erosion, transition to sustainable land fertility practices, planting of
waterways and wetlands and fencing vulnerable areas. Horticulture -assistance with moving away from huge monoculture and

chemical practices which destroys biodiversity. Transport - transition to EVs



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes as a democratic process it is essential that the Government is accountable to in Independent private commission.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes they should be highly regarded people with a variety of expertise such as in climate change and environmental science,
business, engineering, social policy, Maori interests, and communication



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

There are unknowns in the predictions around climate change so there needs to be flexibility around dealing with these.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

with the impacts of climate change happening more frequently we need better plans and policies in dealing with these issues.
Therefore we need more understanding of the science of these effects eg on our biodiversity, and human health to better deal with
them.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
This issue affects everyone and in some ways affects the already disadvantaged in communities more. It is therefore wise to share

information and support



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
I have been a Forest and Bird member for 40 years and am an active supporter of Tawharanui Open Sanctuary. I love tramping and

have recently tramped 300kms of the Te Araroa trail. I am involved in a very progressive local community garden. As a member of
Transition Towns Pt Chevalier I am actively involved in activities with the group to support sustainable living practices. I also feel we as

a wealthy country must address some of the excessive damage we have created to climate change that is affecting our Pacific Island
neighbours who are suffering the most and have been minimal emitters. It is because of these interests and social concerns and my

concern for the planet and for future generations that I fully support the Green Party in its aim to pass the Zero Carbon Act as
proposed.
