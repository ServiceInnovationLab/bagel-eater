Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Anthony Farrell









Reference no: 1796

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes

 The government should not be setting greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets in legislation. Although the proposed bill is yet
 to be drafted it is obvious to all New Zealanders what form it will take. The bill if enacted will be the most damaging legislation to be
 seen in New Zealand for all of our non military history.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 No target should be set.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Notes
 New Zealand should have no targets to meet.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Notes
 The bill must never be passed into legislation.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes

 There should be no emissions budgets implemented.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Notes
 Yes. The next government should be able to cancel all planned budgets to minimise the damage this proposed legislation will do to
 the New Zealand economy and the standard of living , health and welfare of New Zealand citizens. The third budget period will never

 be reached.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes
 Yes. The next new government should be able to cancel all planned budgets to minimise the damage this proposed legislation will do

 to the New Zealand economy and the standard of living , health and welfare of New Zealand citizens. The second budget period will
 never be reached.



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
No
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
The public of New Zealand must be consulted on all issues relating to this proposed bill. Not just as to whether they support the

details of the bill but rather whether they support the bill at all. This submission is inadequate.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes
None.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes
It is obvious the commissioners will be hand picked for their political views in support of the legislation. There will be no

commissioners appointed who do not agree with the legislation because they understand and do not agree with the lack of scientific
rigour behind it.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
The proposed bill is based on the premise that the science is settled and there need be no further scientific discussion to justify it.
That view is not held by many thousands of New Zealanders who have very valid scientific qualifications, who are well educated in

atmospheric physics and climate change matters and who have been monitoring the political dialogue on this issue for many years.
The minister has included statements on weather events in the introduction to the MfE conversation document regarding historical

climate change that are demonstrably incorrect. When questioned he declines to enter into any discussion on these statements. Let
me make it very clear, 'The science is not settled'. The economic impact on New Zealanders of this draconian legislation will be

immense, potentially destroying the livelihood of New Zealanders living in already damaged areas due to the political ideology of a
very small proportion of the population. The government does not have a mandate to force this legislation on the country. It must not
be allowed to proceed without a comprehensive explanation of the scientific evidence and economic impact and a binding

referendum agreeing to support it. A very large number of New Zealanders will not agree that this bill in any form be introduced to
Parliament and submitted for passage into law. The bill must not proceed.
