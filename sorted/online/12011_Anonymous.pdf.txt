Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 12011

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 We need a target set in legislation



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 I support the most ambitious target of reducing total greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050. I agree that the evidence for methane is
 unclear and it may be most appropriate to reduce these to sustainable levels but I would like our aim to reflect the importance of this

 issue



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 This should be done by reducing our own emissions and not relying on international carbon credits. I have concerns about the
 validity of the international carbon credit process and we need to focus on our own issues first. We also need to look at reducing our

 gross emissions and not just the net.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 Obviously there are two possibilities - increasing or reducing targets. I would not be keen on reducing them but I think allowing for
 changes is important



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Yes, and we need to strengthen our 2030 Paris Agreement targets




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 I think a 15 year time frame does have some built in flexibility.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

Definitely. They need to be clear leaders in this respect



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Plans should be comprehensive, fair, environmentally sustainable and include a commitment to the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

They should provide scientific advice and monitor progress.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

The government needs to be responsible overall for decisions



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

In addition public health should be represented. Climate change is a significant public health issue



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes - I think we are seeing the regular consequences of climate change (floods etc) and this needs to be addressed in legislation.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
involvement of local government is also key in this process.
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

This needs to be explored in detail



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Climate change is a real significant problem that we are all grappling with. Clear leadership and specific targets will be hugely

important
