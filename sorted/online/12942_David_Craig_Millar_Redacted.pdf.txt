Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

David Craig Millar






Reference no: 12942


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes

 Target should not include short term gasses.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Notes
 Human produced carbon dioxide isn't the only factor in the greenhouse effect. Carbon dioxide (however produced) makes up less
 than 15% of greenhouse gases. The largest is water vapour. Don't blame cows. They are carbon neutral. See Doug's article in NZ

 Farmer



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes



 Clause

 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Position
 No

 Notes



 Clause
 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
 Notes

 Don't blame cows. Councils need to clean up act regarding dumping sewerage into the sea.



 Clause
 12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
 (NZ ETS)?

 Notes
 I think more research needs to be looked at from both sides of the argument. Climate change isn't humans fault.



 Clause

 13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
 Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

 Notes
 I think that there needs to be a range of people on it. Even scientists that don't agree that it's humans fault should be on it



 Clause
 16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

 exposure to climate change risks?
Notes

If it violates the current privacy laws, then no.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
Climate change isn't humans fault. There are actually more scientists that agree with that statement than most realise. So consult

with them as well as those who believe whatever they're told.
