Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Reference no: 12267


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 Need to oblige though the legislative framework local bodies like Environment Canterbury to work in the mitigation space not just in
 adaptation. Change the way as a nation we look at economic activity. We cannot continue the (what I believe to be insane) reliance on

 GDP as a measure of how well our economy let alone our country is performing. Endless growth is not an option so we need to look
 really seriously at the alternative economic thinkers who already have so many of the answers to this, and make the essential
 paradigm shift in our thinking. Again the media need to have their consciousness raised in this as they parrot the current paradigm

 constantly and unashamedly making it very hard for those aware of the problem with this to get any cut through at all.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 I have put no as I worry about how the data will be analysed. If the targets are brought forward I would say yes to that. We may have to
 make some hard decisions to meet the targets and these must be faced not deferred.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Only to speed things up though not as a way to 'wiggle out'
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

The most aggressive cuts to CO2 must be made in the first period of time though



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Lower income people will need support including continuing awareness raising programmes. Media need to get out of their
sometimes resistant approaches to this issue. They also need to think more about what balance actually means. They give far too

much time and credence to the lunatic fringe in this issue. i.e. climate deniers. All groups who can make really significant impacts on
climate by their own actions e.g. the farming community. This must be a topic that goes across all government portfolios. The impact

on emissions and climate impacts of all we do as a nation.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

Not at the expense of mitigation though.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
