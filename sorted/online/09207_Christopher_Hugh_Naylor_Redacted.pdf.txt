Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Christopher Hugh Naylor










Reference no: 9207


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases
 Notes




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 New Zealand should be looking to supply carbon credits to other countries with preference to developing countries. ie we should be

 carbon positive.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 We need stability and avoid interference from powerful lobby groups, eg the fossil fuel industry



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes
 tree planting, technology etc may change interim timings of the pathway to 2050 but this should be done through the Climate
 Commission, not government.




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No
 Notes

 Climate Change is the pre-eminent 'exceptional circumstance' that has been constantly downgraded due to short-termism and
political expediency. The opportunity for "adjustments" is long gone.




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
But only in a holistic way. ie the fiscal position of any given part of NZ may be hugely negative under carbon targets but the wider,

global situation must have precedence as well as social equity and environmental sustainability



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
obviously!




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The UN's Sustainability Goals are a good starting point. We should be taking a leadership role in the Pacific as a priority within a more

general leading position internationally.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
No 'worthies' or other political appointments, please.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Work needs to be done on the interface/responsibilities between national and local government with a clear position of no-one left

behind. Just as, globally, those most able will have to do more, (ie. NZ,) so nationally we should see this as a inclusive, pan-NZ effort



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
While there are great opportunities, there will be significant costs to transition to a low-carbon economy. New Zealand should be

playing a greater role in tax reform, particularly internationally, so that transnational corporations are contributing their share. The
world is wealthy enough to manage the Transition but only if tax evasion is stamped out.
