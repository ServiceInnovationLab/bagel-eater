Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 2621

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes
 Zero emissions by 2050 is the absolute latest that we can afford to reach this goal - surely aiming for earlier just in case we fall short

 would be a more effective target. This is the absolute most important issue we are facing and needs serious action now, not in 20
 years.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 Aiming for 2050 is already too late, the environment requires net zero emissions by 2040 to remain functional.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 We need to make changes here in New Zealand without relying on other countries' successes.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 When the situation worsens, our goals must be re-evaluated to satisfy the demands of our planet.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 However, if the goals of the first 5 years fails, the next 5 ought to take that into account and modify to move more strongly in a
 positive direction.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 It should only be changed if it is to have a stronger position against climate change.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes

Changes need to made immediately and setting time frames will ensure our goals are upheld.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Need to work with DOC, Forest & Bird, other wildlife and conservation groups etc. Climate change is the most important
consideration, but pollution levels, health impacts, conservation and agriculture are all vital parts also.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Have to ensure that the commission have powers to make changes in itself, as long as it is backed up by independent science.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

Organisations should have to be transparent about how they affect environmental issues, and the public ought to be able to
understand the impacts of their products/services etc.
