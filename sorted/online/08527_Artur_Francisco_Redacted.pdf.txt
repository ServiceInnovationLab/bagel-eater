Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Oxfam New Zealand (Artur Francisco)








Reference no: 8527

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 To give us the best possibility of achieving no more than 1.5 degrees warming by the end of the century, there must be rapid cuts in
 all greenhouse gases beginning now. I support a net-zero target of 2040 with the majority of cuts occurring over the next decade.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 I strongly support the ‘firewall’ principle – that New Zealand’s targets must be achieved by actual cuts in our own emissions, and not
 through the purchase of overseas carbon credits or an over-reliance on forests as carbon sinks.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Notes

 To give us the best possibility of achieving no more than 1.5 degrees warming by the end of the century, there must be rapid cuts in
 all greenhouse gases beginning now. I support a net-zero target of 2040 with the majority of cuts occurring over the next decade.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes



 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

 Notes
The legislation should establish the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees. We should not settle for 2 degrees warming, that would

lock in devastating impacts on Pacific Island states and cause significant extinctions. That is not acceptable. To give us the best
possibility of achieving no more than 1.5 degrees warming by the end of the century, there must be rapid cuts in all greenhouse

gases beginning now. I support a net-zero target of 2040 with the majority of cuts occurring over the next decade. I support all
greenhouse gases being included in the law, consistent with international climate frameworks. The Intergovernmental Panel on

Climate Change makes it clear that methane reduction is critical to success in tackling climate change. It is politically and scientifically
untenable for New Zealand’s climate law to exclude any gases from our biggest emitting sector - the agricultural sector. I support the
establishment of a Climate Commission, whose role should be to devise binding budgets. The Climate Commission should have

statutory teeth, otherwise, it is merely an advisory group that governments could ignore. Climate budgets should be legally binding
and set a bare-minimum ambition, which must be achieved or bettered by government within the prescribed timeframes. Finally, while

budgets should be binding, policy recommendations from the Commission should be just that - recommendations. I strongly support
the ‘firewall’ principle – that New Zealand’s targets must be achieved by actual cuts in our own emissions, and not through the

purchase of overseas carbon credits or an over-reliance on forests as carbon sinks. Regarding our international commitments, the Bill
must include a requirement that governments produce annual reports about New Zealand’s international climate change
contributions. As a Pacific nation, we must ensure that the Pacific countries get the support they need to adapt to the devastating

effects of climate change and their changing environment – a problem they contributed very little to. Access to climate finance is a
matter of justice: those who have contributed least to the causes of the problem are typically the most vulnerable to its impacts and

have the least resources to respond. New Zealand must demonstrate global leadership and match its bold vision for lower carbon
emissions at home by having an equally ambitious climate change strategy abroad.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes

I strongly support the ‘firewall’ principle – that New Zealand’s targets must be achieved by actual cuts in our own emissions, and not
through the purchase of overseas carbon credits or an over-reliance on forests as carbon sinks.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Dear Minister, I support the passing of legally binding climate law and maintain that Climate Change is a global problem – it cannot be
tackled by countries in isolation. The law must be fair, ambitious and consistent with the climate science and international frameworks

across political parties is preferred, any cross-party agreement should not be achieved at the cost of strong climate law. Climate

change is the greatest challenge facing humanity. It would be wrong to have broad agreement on weak law, when what is urgently
needed to address the problem is strong law. The world needs pathways to transformational change if we are to avoid catastrophic
warming. This is the scale of the challenge. The science is clear: the only way we can succeed is with big ambition. New Zealand
must be bold and pass strong law for the sake of our precious earth and future generations. Nga Mihi Artur Francisco
