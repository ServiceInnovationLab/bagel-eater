Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill






Reference no: 1560

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes




 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 It's more effective to invest in domestic emissions reductions only in order to affect the necessairy domestic action and change.

 International carbon units are just a paper excercise.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes

 Only in case of sudden, unexpected circumstances or when circumstances are worse than expected; as well as for new international
 treaty or agreement obligations but not for political reasons. (See Q 7)



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 In case of sudden, unexpected circumstances or when circumstances are worse than expected; as well as for new international

 treaty or agreement obligations but not for political reasons or gains.



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Most updated scientific data, evidence-based policy initiatives as well as innovation need to be considered. It's critical that plans for
increasing the number of trees and forestry activities adopt a diverse approach. The mono-culture of Pinus Radiata is risky,

unsustainable and undesirable. There is too much wastage from current logging practices and neighbours down streams suffer the
consequences. Regional councils also seem to be reluctant to prosecute breaches under the RMS. There needs to be more

regulation to enforce sustainable logging practises, whereby clear felling and erosion is reduced as well as better protection of
waterways. Forestry isn't really economically viable for many farmers at the moment and they will be reluctant to switch to this landuse

without incentives. Without any structural change to the forestry industry, landwoners are currently unlikely to receive any worthwhile
price increases as log prices increase. Landowners and regions should receive Government support to develop small-scale,
specialised diverse, woodlots and local industries to produce high-quality wood products.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Advise Government and hold Government to account




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

Politically neutral and not appointed by the Government of the day.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes
Reporting would pose too much administrative burden. Maybe it could be considered at a later date when there is a lack of progress.




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Not sure whether a Climate Change Commission will be able to leverage the desirable change. It just seems to be another advice-
giving body. Please withold my name and contact details from any publications or info release.
