Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Harvey Molloy








Reference no: 9486

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 I strongly urge that we set a binding target now.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived

 gases
 Notes
 This needs to be done in a shorter timeframe to reduce the risk of countless human lives being lost. We should aim for 2038.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 Carbon Credits have so far completely failed to reduce emissions. We need to set a Gross Emissions Reduction target that tracks

 emissions regardless of carbon sinks. We have to be extremely honest about our emissions.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 if there is a significant change in scientific Yes if supported by scientific knowledge or international law (such as the Paris Agreement
 becoming more ambitious). Any revision should require input from the Climate Commission and approval by Parliament.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 We need strong targets to ensure we are on track to meet our 2030 Paris Agreement target. These targets need to be publicised.
 We should report on our progress in much the same way that we report stock market information. Monthly reporting is needed to
 shift the culture into living with these carbon budgets.




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
Notes

In the event of extreme national disasters such as earthquakes.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes; the following two considerations: 10 scientific knowledge about climate change 2) technology relevant to climate change



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes. Timeframes are vital. This avoids the pitfall of, say, the UK Climate Change Act.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable,

and reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes. The Commission should provide expert advice and hold the government of the day accountable. The commission's responsibility
are not determined by the current election cycle but include a responsibility towards future generations.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Experts from the following fields: climate change policy (including emissions trading) resource economics and impacts (including
social impacts, labour markets and distribution) te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests public health

education (teachers)



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

Yes, risk management is essential. Educational programmes for schools are also vital. Adapting to climate change should be a
mandatory part of the secondary school system.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes
