Reference no: 9703


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later

 Notes
 Legislation without a sanction for non compliance is non effective Sanctions should only be available when all other options are
 exhausted



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases
 Notes




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 Buying credits from other jurisdictions is a failure to take responsibility for ones own over emissions




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 They will be revised by future generations whether we specify otherwise or not

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
