Reference no: 10190


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later

 Notes
 The government must first acknowledge that reductions alone will not reduce atmospheric levels of CO2. The goal must be to
 produce negative net GHG emissions as soon as absolutely possible. And secondly acknowledge that our addiction to energy

 consumption will need to be addressed in a manner similar to the US's War on Drugs and “Homeland Security” .it is entirely
 appropriate to consider deployment of the NZDF to prevent devastation to the economy and stability of New Zealand through
 mitigation and restoration approaches.This would be consistent with the three defence policy objectives: to defend New Zealand

 against low-level threats; to contribute to regional security; and to play a part in global security efforts.[ Increasing GHGs is a slow but
 extremely high level threat].



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 Reductions are insufficient. There must be sequestrations. Neither technical sequestration of produced CO2, nor reduction in the
 combustion of fossil fuels is capable of reducing atmospheric CO2 levels. Plants do it as they grow. A sustainable portion of the

 developed biomass can be converted to metabolically inert carbon, as chars, and returned, beneficially to soils.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 With the exception that in the event that budgeted targets are met in advance, then the targets for the subsequent phase should be
 advanced.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 The limited abilities of economic systems to adapt rapidly requires that they have a sense of some timely security. There will be
 strains, and pains, as the current systems must adapt to the realities that are being and will be experienced.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 "Should not be changed" unless targets are met sooner and changes are to accelerate the subsequent phase and goals.
Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

The conditions that are being created by the economic system are "exceptional circumstances". The inherited conventions of social
responses by governments and commercial interests have been to revert to deferral of change to the practices which have

precipitated the contemporary exceptional circumstances. Deferrals must not be permitted.



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
With the Commission as a "decision-maker".. the Government should have the capacity to set aside the decisions by parliamentary

action without causing damage to the Commission's stability and continuing functions..



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
1). For all members of Government to become aware of the eminent dangers of anthropologically induced climate change to the
economy and social stability.– A legislated insistence that participants in government actions become educated, to the extent of their

abilities, in the best available information and projections that science can provide.. 2) Establish means to meet the budgets with
logistical and strategic effectiveness such as may be provided by the NZDF. (The effort may well require "military" interventions to

assure proactive actions, and rapid response to unanticipated events).



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

The Commission should present decisions and positions based on their monitoring of progress and developing knowledge. If
Government chooses.to ignore those decisions.. leave it to the people.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Te Climate Change Commission needs only individuals with expertise related to changes related to climate, as they have occurred,
are occurring and are projected to occur. The issues of social and economic stability should remain within the purview of elected
Governments.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes

The adaptations, as actions taken in reaction to events, are unrelated to establishing net zero (or negative) carbon dioxide (and other
GHGs) emissions.The Zero Carbon Bill should remain proactive, laying the foundations for preemptive and protective action to reduce

consequences of projected climate changes.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes
..Not entirely..-from ZeroCarbon Bill , Discussion Document,p.47.. "At the moment, the way we respond and adapt to climate change

impacts is not well coordinated. Many of the risks, impacts and actions to adapt are dealt with across a number of different legislative
and regulatory regimes." --Would not the NZDF provide either the agency or the model to follow?




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes

Notes
And.. make the reports easily accessible and published for observation by all organisations and the public..




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

I greatly respect the hundreds, or thousands, of hours devoted to these efforts. But one aspect of 'adaptation' has not been
mentioned, and it may be as dangerous as continued GHG emissions. The process of reaching action is heavily front-end loaded,

burdened, by the time and expense it seems to take before any action emerges. The established political process is wasteful,
destructive of time and intellectual power that could be applied to a diversification of approaches that fit needed local individuals and

cultural adaptions.. Freeing adaptation from preconceived concepts and politically derived national compliances may be required..
