Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

This is probably the most important legislation to be brought before parliament in the past decade....make sure that it moves quickly
through all stages and is well-passed before the next election. Implementing it only should be the election issue, not the bill itself
languishing in parliament.
