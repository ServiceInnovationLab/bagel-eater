Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Dean Campbell Alexander










Reference no: 9128


Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 We do have some time to make the required adjustments. Setting the target now will allow certainty to these targets and there will be
 less likelihood of the goal posts moving over time. It is important that there are mechanisms for this to be altered if required as
 circumstances and science will change over time.




 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes
 All sectors of NZ must contribute to the task ahead. However it is important that we continue to drive economic growth and I feel that
 a total net zero emission target would be to crippling to the economy. Science has suggested that global temperatures can be

 stabilised without reducing short lived gases to zero, therefore agriculture can play its part and maintain itself as such a sustainable
 and important part of the economy going forward.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 As a nation we have committed to do our part in reducing global gas emissions. If we are committed to this then we must send the
 signal now so that we have the best chance of achieving it. Why would we want to commit future generation to the burden of having

 to buy credits to achieve our targets that we were not courageous enough to aim for. The set targets are ambitious, many countries
 are going to battle to achieve them so the supply of surplus credits is going to be minimal, the cost, especially as we head towards

 2050 will be high.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 2050 is a long way out. Circumstance and science will change and provide opportunity. There must be flexibility to allow for this to be
 assessed along the journey.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes
An incoming government should not be allowed to much flexibility for change as that will provide less certainty. Long term planning

that flows through changes in government is important, however, option 2 provides some flexibility over time.



Clause

7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Just like any business, the nation must remain viable and continue to grow. Industry must be given time to make the required
adjustments, there must be long term plans set out and there must be regular monitoring of progress so assessment can be made

in a timely manor of any required adjustments



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
While it is important that we act now, it is also very important that we look after the viability of the nation for future generations. Many

of the conversations that have been had have come from the heart where emotion can take control with the talk being about the
need for large quick change. Many do not appreciate the implications that this will bring to many businesses and communities. We

must go through this process using our heads so that we have a carefully planned approach, giving time for adjustment and remain
with sustainable communities into the future. It must be remembered that the overall goal here is for reduced total global emissions.

We are one of the most efficient producers of agriculture product in the world. Any drastic actions which reduced our abilities to
provide this food to the world would likely result in extra production being picked up by a less efficient producing nation and therefore
negatively impact on total global emissions. While agriculture must play it part, science has indicated that we do not need to get to

zero short lived gas emissions to stabilise global temperatures, therefore don't over burden our economy.
