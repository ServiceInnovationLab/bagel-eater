Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Marjan van den Belt





Reference no: 10806

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes
 This question is unclear; the government should set a 2050 target of net zero GhG emissions by 2050 now. Or the Government sets

 a goal to reach net zero emissions by 2050 and the CCC advises on specific emission budgets for the government later/asap.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 Development aid should encourage support for other countries to develop carbon credits (and associated social and economic
 benefits) as well.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No

 Notes
 Politics du jour should not be allowed to change targets. A revision for stricter targets based on emerging science should be allowed.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 In addition, there should be a tentative emission 'budget' or trajectory all the way to 2050. This can be done through back casting

 based on plausible narratives derived from synthesis. These narratives / story lines should be the basis for improved analysis to allow
 for step changes beyond incremental projections.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 Provided that the budget is ambitious in the short run and does not delay. It should provide a clear and steadfast message to

 business and society. The only reason to adjust the budget would be if scientific information (and the CCC) calls for faster and stricter
 budgets. Adjusting budgets equates to 'creative bookkeeping' and does not provide a clear indication on whether actions and
 outcomes are on track, compared to the budgets.




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No
 Notes

 Only if stricter budgets on a shorter time line are proposed.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes
The circumstances are not exceptional, but an artifact of an outdated economic approach. Update/future proof governmental

systems to become more agile and respond to these challenges in a more coherent manner. For example, 'fiscal circumstances and,
in particular, the likely impact of the decision on taxation, public spending and public borrowing' and 'economic circumstances and, in

particular, the likely impact of the decision on the economy and the competitiveness of particular sectors of the economy' are typical
excuses that should NOT be allowed. The only competitive economy of the future IS a low GhG economy with characteristics of a
circular-, sharing-, ecological- and regenerative economy.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes

Targets and time frames are essential to give a clear signal to other sectors of society, so they can act accordingly.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
1. Start developing capacity in systems thinking, - design and - modelling. Neither Vivid or NZIER use systems based modelling
(because it is hard) and therefore expose the decisions to systemic blind spots (i.e. unintended consequences and missed

opportunities). 2. Start taking the Sustainable Development Goals more seriously. SDG#13 is Climate Action and interlinked with all
other SDGs. After the low-hanging fruits regarding lowering emissions are exhausted, additional climate adaptation and mitigation can

only happen by taking the other SDGs into account.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Facilitate the connection/communication between local, regional and national government authorities for coherent climate mitigation
and adaptation efforts.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Notes
Unclear question. See WISE RESPONSE submission for thoughtful suggestion.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
However, in addition to or instead of resource economists, perhaps consider Futurists, Scenario Planner, Sustainable Development

experts, Ecological Economists, Systems Thinkers/Designers and/or Communication experts.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
Mitigation is the first priority. However, it will require systemic changes and can't be achieved without adaptation.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Please, add a detailed, multi-scalable National Land and Coastal Use / Management Plan.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

Transparency is critical for credibility and could facilitate emerging solutions and partnerships, if done in an ethical, constructive and
fair way.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Thank you for the opportunity to submit. Climate Change is one of the critical challenges we face to transition to a more sustainable
and desirable society. I also wholeheartedly support the more elaborate submission by Wise Response.
