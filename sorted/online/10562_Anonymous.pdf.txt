Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill











Reference no: 10562

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes
 This is set as a target that cannot be changed if future government parties change.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 This has to include Methane emissions from agricultural in the ETS




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 No trading of international carbon units as this takes away the responsibility of NZ to do their own work in the country. As an

 independent country that emits around 0.15 of carbon, we need to make a difference, not trade our way out of it.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 If we improve sooner that 2050, reduce the target year to 2040 or sooner.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 It is crucial to put in place the budgets that ensure we meet the targets set up now and these cannot be changed, regardless on the
 governments of the future. This is to ensure protection of the environments and future generations.




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No
 Notes
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
1) Dairy farmers to reduce their practices as they should be part of the Emission Trading Scheme reduction targets. The inclusion of

methane and nitrous oxide are important contributors to the carbon emissions in NZ. The government has to provide a fair and just
transition to these farmers. 2) Private companies that need to be committed to reducing their emissions as this will be our

international market advantage in the future, which can be realised with benefits in monetary terms and in terms of greenwashing. 3)
Urban planners, regional, central government to provide efficient public transport, efficient social housing and green space for

example to provide good well being to mitigate climate change in NZ in urban areas.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
They must have a mandate to ensure the appropriate regulations are put in place to reach the targets.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes
I think the CCC should have both advising the government on policy setting and be part of the decision making process in the

number of units available which must include Agriculture.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Possibly more neutral industry (or ex-) people who have are committed to meeting the targets as they can relate to
industries/business




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes

Notes
Crucial to obtain the necessary information to track changes and make stronger policies if targets are not being met.
