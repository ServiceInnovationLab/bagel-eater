Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Colin Allan Bloomfield






Reference no: 11679


Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 There is no further time for delay. The seriousness of this issue has been appreciated for decades, with relatively little progress
 made; it is time for bold steps not weasel words and worthy statements of intent. I note that although the issue has been regarded
 as pressing for decades it is difficult to point to any significant way in which our lifestyle, as a high income country, has changed as a

 result. This might once have been dismissed as complacency; now it looks like reckless arrogance.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 NZ has to confront the challenge of methane emissions from agriculture, instead of continuing to ring fence and privilege that one
 sector. It is time for the agricultural sector to take responsibility for the environmental damage that it is causing and for NZ to further

 diversify its economic activity and progressively direct it away from animal agriculture.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 At the root of this challenge is the unsustainability of life in high income countries. Over coming decades we need to plan a radical
 change in cultural and societal attitudes. This will not be achieved with the urgency required if we continue to buy time by the
 purchasing international carbon units. In fact if anything this is further evidence of high income countries being reluctant to take full

 responsibility for their part in causing climate change over the past 100 years. On the subject of taking responsibility, it is time to stop
 prefacing every statement on climate change in relation to NZ with the comment that our we are a low emitter. The proper measure
 here should be the per capita emissions, and by that measure we are one of the worst offenders on the planet. Most New

 Zealanders are not even aware of that, and it is well beyond time that they understood the full implications of our way of life and
 economic activity.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 We have already spent far too much time looking for and making excuses for our lack of action. Climate change is the most pressing

 challenge facing humanity, and it's time that we treated it as such.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes
Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
Several of these matters are liable to be exploited to delay the making of necessary difficult decisions. Further delay is simply not an

option.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Although there should be a strong bedrock of climate science expertise; any other areas of expertise should be secondary to that.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
Adaptation involves quite a different focus and should be overseen by a separate body, which would of course be informed in its work

by the Climate Change Commission. My concern is that responsibility for adaptation will distract from the substantial urgent mitigation
strategies that the Commission will need to focus on.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
It's not clear what the question is referring to, and reference to p47 sheds no additional light.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
