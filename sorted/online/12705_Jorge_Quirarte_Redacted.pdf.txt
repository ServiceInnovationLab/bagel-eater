Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The climate and social well being are tied up. The diary families need a sustainable way out of the industry that allows them to
prosper economically too. Both arms need to close at the same time, the one that dis encourage people to rely on dairy farming and

the arm that helps them move on to another land/sustainable/profit system. i.e. Hemp. This Bill needs to become more than the
greens bill, it needs to ask the hard questions about consumption reduction and circular economy. And comprehensively it should

limit the Military actions and consequences on the natural environment too, by direct pollution and the indirect pollution war and
poverty causes too.
