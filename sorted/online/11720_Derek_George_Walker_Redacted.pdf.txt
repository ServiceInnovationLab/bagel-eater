Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Derek George Walker









Reference no: 11720

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes
 Climate change is a global problem so the solutions for NZ can legitimately be found through partnerships with other countries rather
 than going it alone which could be more difficult and more economically risky.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 But ONLY to make it even stronger, i.e. a greater reduction than net zero by 2050.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes

 But of course the 2050 target cannot be reduced from net zero emissions, only improved, as stated in question 4.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 But exceptional circumstances would only be: in the event of a natural disaster or major human-made disaster eg. nuclear accident,
 war.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The overall reduction by 2050 and the proportion of that required in the budget period to stay on track - using results of completed

budget periods and the already fixed budget in periods coming up. The details of the reduction and hence the allowed quantity of
emissions relating to every industry etc sector and appointed lead officials within each sector that the Government will have to work

with. Consultation with ENGOs and other non-commercial stakeholders. And others - this is not a complete list!



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
Mechanisms would be required for spreading fairly the cost of admin and compliance across all businesses involved in each service,

etc. and government.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
I'm excited to be submitting on the Zero Carbon Bill as I am a long-time conservationist, environmentalist and supporter of Green

parties, in Australia as well as New Zealand. My submission therefore entirely supports the introduction of this bill. Congratulations to
the coalition government for this and all the fantastic changes you are making in New Zealand. New Zealand may be a small country,

with a small population and a small proportion of the world's greenhouse gas emissions but it is respected internationally, and other
nations will be inspired by our actions to tackle climate change - it is great to lead the way, and the certainty that this bill will give to

industry will drive a new clean, efficient economy, that will finally show the world how we can live sustainably on this planet, to provide
inter-generational equity, which just makes sense - no more greed! The Commission needs to include experts on the natural world
and it's protection for its own sake, accounting for the environmental services that it provides ($ value). This would also encompass

how we can help nature (species, ecosystems, etc.) adapt to climate change. The Commission's expert on agriculture would need to
propose examination of sheep and dairy farming and the conversion of such land to forest growing for carbon sequestration,

including government sponsorship for conversion. This is probably too specific for this submission but regarding transport in, out of
and around NZ, of people and goods - alternatives to air transport, such as modern large sailing craft or the use of biofuels must be

investigated. I believe that The Zero Carbon Act should also provide a framework for the help we give our neighbouring countries
(principally the Pasifika region) facing climate change including transparency in international climate finance. For our Pasifika

neighbours, NZ must support them with their specific problems and the actions to fix them whether financial, on-the-ground work or
technology for adaptation or halting climate change, or assistance in creating appropriate legislation or strategies/planning. Yours
faithfully, Derek G. Walker.
