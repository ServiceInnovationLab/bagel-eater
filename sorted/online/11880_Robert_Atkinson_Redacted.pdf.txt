Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Robert Atkinson






Reference no: 11880


Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 I have grave doubts about success but happy you are taking it seriously. See NZ govt stats online for "New Zealandâ€™s net greenhouse
 gas emissions have increased 54 percent since 1990". Any choice now is OK so long as you measure up against it and consider

 tightening it up later.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 Don't trust foreign carbon units. Also if I am ight and NZ fails they will just be a drastic cost for no advantage. If we are to give
 foreigners money do so by bribing third world countries to stop destroying native forest.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 self evident



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 seems rational. will require all party support.




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes

 Rather pointless since NZ govt has a history of totally missing climate change targets. maybe link minister's pensions to missing
 targets?



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

 Notes
 I am concerned about internation air and sea travel climate change impacts. Unable to find out how it is dealt with by NZ proposed
 policy. Representing about 10% of CO2 output it must be tackled. How about recording either all arriving or all departing

 flights/voyages (the former being easier to manage). Has a serious impact on tourism - NZ needs to move from cheap high-volume to
 high-value low volume tourism.
Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
Essential. In fact the most important fact. Please read Prof Jim Fynn's great book and try arguing with his conclusion.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
I've read page 47 buty I can't see what you are talking about.




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Other than to tell you that this kind of babble is self-defeating I will resist it. Please read "No Place to Hide: Climate Change - A short
introduction for New Zealanders"; it will improve your ability with English language and clarify your understanding of a very complex

matter.
