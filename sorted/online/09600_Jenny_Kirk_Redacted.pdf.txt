Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Jenny Kirk










Reference no: 9600


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Carbon Dioxide - Reducing net carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 When we plant new forests - these need to be indigenous trees to replace all of those which have been lost over the last 150 years.
 Any pine or exotic trees to be planted need to be modified so they do not flower or seed.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 It is going to be difficult to reach this target. I would not like to see the target put further out than 2050. This has to be done.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No
 Notes

 The govt needs to have a separate budget for emergencies such as earthquakes or major flooding so that it cannot use these
 events as a reason for adjusting its emissions budget.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

and I would like to see included - information about how climate change is impacting on the Pacific Islands, and what NZ can do to
help the PIs to deal with it. And how the adaption plan impacts on the ordinary person and what actions can be taken to mitigate

these.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

An important issue which MUST be considered : how will climate change measures affect the ordinary person (those on low to middle
incomes, beneficiaries, ill or disabled, children etc) ? And what measures can be made to ensure these people continue to live, work

and play in an accessible way. ? Should the climate change commission have members who are closely aligned to local communities?
ie who could give advice on how specific decisions might affect the ordinary person.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

And also add in information about what help is being provided to the Pacific Islands.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
See my notes above. The Climate Change commissioners need to have access to opinion and comment about how their decisions

might impact on ordinary people, and also on the Pacific Islands.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

The adaption plan probably needs to include how the costs will be paid for, and who will be paying them. I don't think local govt can
bear the burden of adaption costs on its own - this is a central govt responsibility.
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

Not just "explore" this idea, but actually do it.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
The adaption plan needs to be followed by an action plan - one that is realistic and sustainable, and achieveable by everyone - not

just those with power and money.
