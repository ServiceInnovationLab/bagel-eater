Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Gavin Maclean, None (Gavin Maclean)








Reference no: 12532

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 Setting a target cannot be postponed, but there should be allowance to revise it every few years. In particular, the intermediate steps
 will need revision.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 Since the urgency will grow long before 2050,to set a lower target now will only make later adjustment more difiicult.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 This is the way of leadership. Aotearoa is likely to change faster than many large countries, and an independent stance is the only

 one that can be widely copied.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 This should be worded "as circumstances change." "If" promotes inappropriate complacency.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes
 This is subordinate to Question 4, which allows any budget to be changed. This may sound unreasonable for the purpose of
 business planning, but any government can take that into consideration in the circumstances of the time.




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Notes
 See 4,6. Of course they should have the ability, but we cannot limit its range. Surely the circumstances determine the necessary
 range of adjustment. You cannot just keep plodding along whatever happens, and you certainly cannot instruct a future government

 to do so in the face of common sense and democracy.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
See final comment to this submission.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

The private sector needs public assistance, and appropriate regulation.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

This is too wide to answer! A good start has been made, involving as many sectors as possible, and the challenge is to keep it up. It
would be premature to try and specify all issues and sectors, except indicatively. No doubt many vested interests will appreciate the

question though.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

The Commission as proposed should be the ideally informed and neutral body to do this; but not to rule out monitoring by other
individuals and organisations.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
Preferably, advising the government on a stronger economic tool than the ETS, which is likely to fail at any carbon price. The
Commission should not be bound by its MOU or constituion or whatever it is called, to cling to one particular instrument.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes
A qualified "yes." It is in practice most unlikely to cover the problem of adapting, as the word implies total coverage. However, in the

current political climate, with the whole issue of climate change only recently taken seriously, the bill needs to acknowledge some
adaptive possiblities in order to be supported.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

For a start. See final comment.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

You need a hyphen: adaptation-reporting, or targeted-adaptation? It's ambiguous.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
I think the proposals and process leading to the Bill are excellent, and probably as strong as they can be made in the current political

climate—a climate that, like the physical one, will change. What I propose goes beyond that, and the simple logic will appeal to you
each individually, though you may not feel able to discuss it. The point is to effect a solution, not merely postpone it, and in deeper

discussion to look beyond 2050, when no amount of transformation, of industry or consumption, will be adequate without simple
reduction. It is hard to speak of de-industrialisation, de-consumption, and deceleration, and at the far end of those, depopulation; yet

that very discussion is occurring outside official circles. If it has not reached good currency soon, then continuing growth in demand
will destroy any targets. What you can do, having absorbed this imperative, is look carefully at wording, to assist this embryonic
cultural change into the world. Useful qualifying phrases, such as “while the population is so excessive,” “while industry remains so

inefficient, unnecessary, and destructive,” and “while striving for jobs tends to create needless infrastructure, destruction, and
transaction costs,” will gently begin to point the way to more lasting solutions. These refer unflinchingly to the global economic

context. You may, some of you, think there is no alternative, but that does not make them invalid.
