Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

ian johnstone






Reference no: 1815


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes

 THE SCIENCE IS NOT SETTLED



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Notes
 Co2 helps increase growth rate of plants. Plants take on Co2. It is NOT a pollutant.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 No

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

 Notes
 Perhaps considering that ALL modelling of climate change has been wrong. Basing any targets on these is simply fraud



 Clause

 11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
 its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No
 Notes



 Clause

 12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Notes
Not required




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Notes
All funding should be aimed towards adaptation rather than on something that will not change 'climate change'




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
If I were to bet on a horse in a race with two mutated feet (ie climate modelling) I would be called stupid. This is what is intended to be
forced upon we the people. Offer a referendum on this in the next electoral process and let the people decided.
