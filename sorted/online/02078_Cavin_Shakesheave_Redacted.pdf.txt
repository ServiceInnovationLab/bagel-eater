 Notes
 Think there is no option for not agreeing to this nonsense which is totally unfair



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived

 gases
 Notes

 The targets are a fooling agenda

 It should not even go down this route its a foolish propersition and there is no option to disagree

 Should not even be considered

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Climate change is really the seasons of the year and weather happens every year and its been a scam for years and people should
be allowed to say this the questions are not set correctly.
