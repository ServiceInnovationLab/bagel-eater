Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Reference no: 7702

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes
 Without a viable path forward to meet the target, when it all becomes too difficult, the target will get ignored. The ZCB shows no

 indication that a viable path exists. Page 10 states “There are plenty of ways.. But this is aspirational and gives no indication it is
 feasible.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived

 gases
 Notes

 Ultimately there will be a trade-off between various options depending on the levels of reduction and the desired outcomes. It would
 be irresponsible to commit to decisions now with the level of uncertainty. Methane net emissions are already zero, provided ruminant
 populations do not grow. Methane recycles turning into carbon dioxide, and then grass to be released by the ruminant. Methane

 emissions are no higher now than decades ago and therefore NZ methane levels are not growing. The article fails to appreciate
 something that should be obvious.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes
 Must keep options open. Those who think domestic planting sufficient should provide information on the number of hectares to be

 planted per year.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 The question implies that the way forward is clear. The best evidence is that at the global level it will be extremely difficult to meet any
 targets without population management. Without a clear path forward flexibility is essential.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes
 It is extremely unlikely that any one has a clear forward path to meet the target. Needed technologies are not in place. The ignorant

 should not force their views on the future.
Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
It is unlikely that anyone now has the capability predict what the future options are. Those who think they do are wrong.




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
Too little focus on economic trade-offs and the wellbeing of New Zealanders and even the feasibility of any action. A path forward that

maintains a viable economy is essential otherwise targets will get ignore.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
No

Notes
One cannot separate policy and action plans. The concept of passing the buck by an organization more powerful than government

should be utterly repudiated. The Commission itself must to establish plans to meet the target taking into account the wellbeing of
New Zealanders and the likelihood of success. If they have the power to impose on Government something that they do not take
responsibility for will undermine democracy and lead to an anti-climate change revolution.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
The most important issue is that the focus should be on HOW to meet the target with specific proposals for renewables, population

management, maintaining the economy, the importance of natural gas to reduce coal and oil. An honest look at options such as
battery powered vehicles taking fully into account whether NZ can grow vehicle numbers at critical levels, and also the environmental

cost in manufacture and disposal. Otherwise it is all pie in the sky. There is also a moral problem of NZ freeloading on other nations.
Those who produce vehicles for us will carry the carbon burden.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
But not adequate. It must be more than advising and monitoring. The Commission must take full responsibility for the path forward.

The mention of an adaptation plan mentioned on page 46 and discussed later is completely inadequate. It is a typical bureaucratic
plan that leaves the "how" out of it.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
Also the Commission needs to ensure that facts are correct. Currently there is no recognition that NZ produced methane is already
net zero. Failure to properly scope the issues will lead to disaster as credibility will fall.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes
Something like a war cabinet is needed. Expertise on the technological change and technological possibilities are essential and a
detailed plan forward is essential. How else can the Commission deal with the real possibility that battery powered vehicles won’t

come on stream quickly enough as internationally the growth rate required is enormously high. We are likely to need to use natural
gas powered conventional vehicles in the short term. There is no recognition that economic survival and the well-being of the nation

is at stake.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
Without having to face the “How” to achieve in a concrete way failure will be inevitable. It will all become the righteous telling the great

unwashed what they should do. But the consultation document is far too weak on its understanding of adaption.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Completely inadequate in being able to create credible action plan. E.g. the problem is not sea level rise, that is a given, the problem
is what we must do. It is all is smoke and mirrors.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
Notes

But the adaptation concept in the report is too weak. Without the Commission taking responsibility for adaptation it will become the
organization of blame




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
There is far too little focus on the seriousness of the problem and the difficulties in making real progress. The expertise seems too
weak. Expertise on how to keep an economy functioning with transformative policies is essential. Clear plans must be prepared

otherwise targets become pipe dreams. The most likely outcome, without clearly focusing on the difficulties, is that it will become too
hard and reactions against climate change as in the US and Australia become more likely.
