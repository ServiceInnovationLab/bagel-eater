Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Isaac Jonathan Freeman










Reference no: 1300


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 A future government may try to to backtrack on our commitment to reducing emissions. We've seen this already with the existing
 emissions trading scheme. If a clear target is set in legislation, there'll be greater visibility if it happens again.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 We need a clear signal that all emissions must go to net zero. Making a different category for short-lived gases will create the

 impression that they're acceptable.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 We should maximise our ability to verify emissions reduction, and this is best achieved by using only domestic reductions. This will
 also provide stronger incentives to innovate in New Zealand, so that we gain a fair share of the economic benefits.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No

 Notes
 The target should be strong and binding. If future governments want to change it, they should be required to follow the full legislative
 process to change it.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
Notes




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Economic considerations should be carefully limited so that we don't continue to protect and subsidise our most polluting industries.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

We've been kicking the can down the road on climate change for a hundred years. We are long overdue for serious action, in the face
of a crisis that could have been avoided. I want to see the government provide a clear signal that we can no longer accept delaying
tactics and obfuscation. Targets should be strong and clear, and incentives aligned towards real change.
