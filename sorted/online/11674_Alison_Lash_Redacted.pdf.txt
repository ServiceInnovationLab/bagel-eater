Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Alison Lash





Reference no: 11674

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 It is critical that a clear target be set in order to give the business sector and households certainty.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived

 gases
 Notes

 However, this target should be reviewed as part of the review of the 5-year rolling budget plans. Once momentum picks up, it may be
 possible to replace this target with an all emissions target.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 Using other countries' emission reductions is either cheating or double-dipping.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 But only revised to make it more stringent, not less.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 Good idea. This has worked in local government planning to eliminate some of the worst flip-flopping consequent on political change.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes

 And only to make it more stringent, not less.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes



 Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Critical to take the emitting groups with you - eg households, car owners, high emissions industries etc. Do it with them, not to them.

Also critical to do your damnedest to take the National Party along too.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes
This will become a critical area and should be removed from the political sphere as far as is possible. In this area, the Commission

should operate independently like the Reserve Bank does or the Commerce Commission.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
Because of the way the RMA operates, local government expertise will be critical.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
This will be a far bigger challenge and a far more expensive exercise than getting our emissions under control. It can't start soon
enough.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
The discussion document talks a lot about the potential costs of reducing emissions. Unfortunately, what most people don't
understand is that the costs of not reducing them will be far greater. Any comms plan around the implementation of this Act should

be sure to make this point forcefully and often. The sooner the world reduces its emissions, the less change we will have to adapt to
and the lower the financial, social and environmental costs will be. We cannot, in all conscience, continue to trash the futures of

today's young people, and those of subsequent generations. There is no Planet B.
