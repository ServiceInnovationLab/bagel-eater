Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Rachel Rose





Reference no: 12677

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 There is NO more time to delay. We must make solid commitments now. I call on all members of Parliament to work together to create

 a consensus: a non-partisan commitment to a legally-binding long term target via this Act.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 All greenhouse gases, including methane, must be significantly reduced. New Zealand should take a science-based approach to
 ensure our emission reduction efforts are as effective as possible. Take "science-based approach" to mean minimising cumulative
 emissions and gross emissions and distinguishing between long and short-lived greenhouse gases. We must urgently minimise our

 cumultative emissions.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 The 2050 target should only be revised following a significant change in scientific knowledge or international law (such as the Paris

 Agreement becoming more ambitious). Any revision should require input from the Climate Change Commission and approval by
 Parliament.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Yes. It is important that three budgets are in effect at all time. This is a cornerstone principle of the Act.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 We have to move beyond partisan politics; NZ cannot afford to flip flop on this issue as governments change. It is inappropriate for an
 incoming government to reduce the targets or effectiveness of a budget already set.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
Notes

Only under exceptional circumstances that cannot be predicted, such as natural disaster. Changes should require the input of the
Climate Change Commission and be approved by Parliament.




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
The emission budget must allow a fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable pathway to the 2050 target.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

Within six months of the budget being set.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Government policy must be fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable and comprehensive. It must also honour and uphold Te
Tiriti o Waitangi.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes, I support the CCC having dual functions: providing advice AND monitoring progress and holding successive governments to

account. It should not make decisions itself because it is not accountable to the public and its members are not democratically
elected. Neither can it be its own watchdog.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
Generally yes but note that public health is also an important area of expertise.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes

Absolutely. NZ's adapation response is very important and the CCC's expertise should contribute to our planning and response.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

I am in favour of the Government preparing a national climate risk assessment, and a national policy plan to address these risks.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

I favour a mandatory adaption reporting power.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
I wish to tautoko the comprehensive and thoughtful submission made to the Ministry by Generation Zero. In particular, I want to

highlight their points about Te Tiriti: "Zero Carbon Act must honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi by giving effect to meaningful partnership
between iwi and the Crown. The Zero Carbon Act’s targets and policies must be made consistently with the tino rangatiratanga of iwi

and hapū, as enshrined in Te Tiriti." Please note, I am happy for the Ministry to publish my name and submission but do NOT consent
to the publication of my email address in any public forum. My email is provided only for the purpose of being contacted by the

Ministry in regard to this submission.
