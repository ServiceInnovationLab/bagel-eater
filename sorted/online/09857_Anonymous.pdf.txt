Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill







Reference no: 9857

Submitter Type:

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 I support this option because it will hold future governments to account - if a target is changed, that government will have to justify it

 and consult on it.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 New Zealand is a very small emitter globally, but per capita we are large emitters. We should view this as a multi-generational
 challenge and commit to international climate leadership by setting a very ambitious goal.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes
 An international credit market (that is audited and overseen by international institutions) is a reasonable way to make reductions. In

 some cases it may also support industries in developing nations to make climate reductions also, which is positive. However,
 domestic reductions should certainly be the largest share of our efforts.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 All legislation is changeable, and regular reviews are sensible. As above, any changes that loosen the regime will have to be made

 public, which should hold future governments accountable. There should be statutory consultation requirements in provisions which
 allow for amending the targets, including for a Climate Commission to make recommendations, and for the government to respond to
 them.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 This provides a level of certainty, and will allow for long term policy planning by industry and government.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes
 As above, robust consultation requirements will be necessary. It would be foolish to think that one government will automatically be
 bound by another's decisions in these matters, but it will be important that a broad consensus is formed on these matters. The

 independent climate commission should play a large role in informing government.



 Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

But the independent climate commission should be empowered to speak out where opportunism reduces the committments in the
budget beyond what is necessary



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

Though i would dde-emphasise the focus on taxation and public borrowing - these considerations may have too short-term a focus
relative to a multi-generational issue like climate change.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
How government will support industries and communities to adapt - climate migration, ie where funding for research etc will come

from. Govt should also consult young people (primary and secondary schools) given that those people will bear the burden of failed
climate action.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

Providing the commission is truly independent, it should be empowered to set this itself. However there will always be a risk that
government will overrule it.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes - but I would put science at the top by far.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Recent cases of communities possibly needing to relocate (Franz Josef, Edgecumbe) mean that New Zealand, led by central

government, needs to understand more about the impacts of climate change.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
In consultation with industry and community - possibly pooling funds (matched by Government) could improve this scheme.




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
I strongly support reducing emissions in New Zealand. Any scheme needs to include and account for all sources of emissions

including urban traffic, agriculture, and industry. Robust transition planning needs to be support, accompanied by well-funded
research into mitigating emissions while retaining valuable industries.
