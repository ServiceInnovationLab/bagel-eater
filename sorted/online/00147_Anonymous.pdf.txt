Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill











Reference no: 147

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes

 The Government should stop this nonsense



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 this is just mindless. Carbon Dioxide is a vital trace gas and we need more of it



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Notes
 NZ should stop pretending that this is about the climate, but rather the marxist redistribution of wealth through the impoverishment

 of new zealanders.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Notes

 there should be no such bill



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 Carbon Dioxide is not a problem



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes

 Carbon Dioxide is not a problem. There should be no emissions budget at all



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Notes
 Carbon Dioxide is not a problem. There should be no emissions budget at all



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No
 Notes

 Carbon Dioxide is not a problem. There should be no emissions budget at all. IPCC models have consistently failed to predict reality,
 to the extent that temperature and sea level data is now routinely altered to fit the model. Carbon Dioxide is not a problem. There
 should be no emissions budget at all
Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Notes
Carbon Dioxide is not a problem. There should be no emissions budget at all. IPCC models have consistently failed to predict reality,

to the extent that temperature and sea level data is now routinely altered to fit the model. Carbon Dioxide is not a problem. There
should be no emissions budget at all




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The government should stop this marxist wealth distribution farce.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
climate change is independent of human activity, and AGW is a scam




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Notes
it should have no role, no position and should not exist




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
The entire commission should be disbanded and everyone who supports AGW climate dishonest should be sent to jail.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Notes

There should be no such bill



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

The Government should drop the pretence that this is about climate



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Notes

The nonsense and bureaucracy around this is unjustifiable and everyone involved need to go to jail.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
Humans have no effect on the climate. CO2 pays no role in warming the planet. IPCC models have failed, and continue to fail,

because they attempt to shoehorn a vital trace gas into a role in which it plays no part. The arctic has not melted, winters have not
stopped and they never will. The sun is the primary driver of earth's climate, with modifications by cosmic rays, which modify both

solar activity and volcanic activity. The current warming from the last glacial period has come to an end, and from here on in it is going
to get colder. To destroy our economy and energy wealth to attempt to take control of something by limiting a vital trace gas is
criminal.
