Notes
Nowhere in the report did I see a mention of the role soil carbon plays. Moving forward it is essential any carbon budgeting done

factors in the role soil carbon can play in fighting climate change. Conversely carbon budgeting done on forests must factor in the
true sequestration levels as large volumes of forestry debris/slash are left on the ground eventually breaking down into CO2. The

Zero Carbon Bill must also consider the impact that large scale conversion to exotic forestry has on small rural communities as
witnessed recently in Tolaga Bay. It also must consider the effect of turning productive pastoral land which is currently sequestering

carbon into the soil into carbon forestry which would see large scale loss of employment and economic activity in rural NZ Moving
forward large scale afforestation leads to the risk of forest fires. If we have our carbon forests go up in smoke then all the effort in
establishing that carbon forest was in vain as all the carbon sequestered will end up in the atmosphere. Let's empower our primary

producers to become more carbon efficient in their production and make meaningful change that enhances New Zealand's mana
and shows the world a better way of doing things
