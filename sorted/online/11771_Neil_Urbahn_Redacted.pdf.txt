Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Neil Urbahn






Reference no: 11771


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes

 No to your AGW agenda. The government should be concentrating on reducing pollution - now THAT is man made. Sewage and
 nitrogen in our waterways, non biodegradable rubbish in our landfills and flowing into our waterways. Carbon dioxide and methane are

 not current concerns - both have been higher in the past without human input.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 The major gases you are talking about here have been higher in the past without human input. Any sort of action on these indicate
 an agenda that has nothing to do with the betterment of the environment.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 NZ doesn't need zero carbon targets so the question is irrelevant. It needs to control the more general pollution. Carbon dioxide and
 methane are minimal in this.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Notes
 NZ doesn't need a zero carbon bill so the question is irrelevant. It needs to control the more general pollution. Carbon dioxide and

 methane are minimal in this.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Notes
 NZ doesn't need "emission" targets so the question is irrelevant. It needs to control the more general pollution. Carbon dioxide and

 methane are minimal in this.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Notes
 NZ doesn't need "emission" targets so the question is irrelevant. It needs to control the more general pollution. Carbon dioxide and
 methane are minimal in this.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No
 Notes

 NZ doesn't need "emission" targets so the question is irrelevant. It needs to control the more general pollution. Carbon dioxide and
 methane are minimal in this.



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
Notes

NZ doesn't need "emission" targets so the question is irrelevant. It needs to control the more general pollution. Carbon dioxide and
methane are minimal in this.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

No
Notes

NZ doesn't need a zero carbon bill so the question is irrelevant. It needs to control the more general pollution. Carbon dioxide and
methane are minimal in this.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
NZ doesn't need "emission" targets so the question is irrelevant. It needs to control the more general pollution. Carbon dioxide and

methane are minimal in this. We should stop wasting money on projects that will have no effect on the Earth.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Another bureaucracy for no advantage to the the planet,



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes

The ETS should be disable as soon as possible.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

It is just more uncontrolled power for a bureaucracy with no advantage to the the planet,



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
There should be no zero carbon bill..



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
There should be no organization to have these functions.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
No

Notes
You're talking about setting up another bureaucracy that will serve no purpose to the planet.
Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
The first questions "2050 Target" are obviously biased towards respondents who support these scheme. Is it designed to purposely

deter those people who disagree with this whole process before they get to the questions they can say "No" to?
