Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

The Forest Garden (Nicholas John Rountree)










Reference no: 1392


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 Methane emissions make up half of the carbon equivalent emissions in NZ. "Stabilising" these methane emission levels is not an
 option if we want to be serious about reducing our climate impact.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 A substantial amount of the forest planting should be permanent native forest ecosystems. 50% of terrestrial carbon storage is in top

 soils and pine plantations are a major contributor to top soil loss (and pollution of our rivers).



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 Yes - only if the target is brought forward to a more aggressive time frame because of more serious recognition of the existential
 threat that rapid anthropogenic climate change has for the future of this planet and the human species.



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
 Notes
 Greater community consultation for carbon emission reduction projects, and greater scrutiny of industry solutions. Otherwise we risk

 large industry hijacking the solutions for the primary purpose of making money and not for the purpose of minimising and sinking
emissions.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes

Mitigation and adaption go hand in hand.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
Household and community scale forest gardens and food forests can provide a decentralised solution to provide food and resources

to New Zealanders while also sinking carbon, reducing food miles and freeing land from industrial food production allowing it to be
returned to native forest cover (further sinking carbon and helping stabilise New Zealand's climate).
