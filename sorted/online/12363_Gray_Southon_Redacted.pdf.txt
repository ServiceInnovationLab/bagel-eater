 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes
 The target should be set in the light of the careful analysis of the commission



 Clause

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 combination of 2 & 3 The target needds to be set in the framework of the long nd short term gasses, but must consxider the

 combined net impact. Commercial forests can be onsidered only as short term offsets.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes
 Limited international carbon units can be traded either way when that results in more efficient carbon reduction, but NZ must no

 compromise its abilitiy to mitigate its own carbon emissions

 But only in extreme circumstances as judged by the Commission

enhanced.
