Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Garvin Filby








Reference no: 2593

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 Should have been done 50 years ago.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 Probably already too late



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 Otherwise how will we know that it's actually being done?



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 Just get on with it. The icecaps are already melting and the oceans are becoming acidic.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 'Trump' proof it - if that's at all possible.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No
 Notes

 Again, some people still do not believe in Climate Change. If they get in charge then they will look for any loophole to get out of this.



 Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

It only goes up to p39?



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
Only it's probably 50 years too late



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Just get on with it. Earth is dying and human excess is to blame.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
Oh good grief, your job is to make decisions that enable the country and its people to function and survive now and in to the future. If

the planet continues to heat up then you have not done your job.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

To promote checks and balances, considering that Scott Pruitt is now in charge of the EPA in the USA



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Who selects the Commissioners?



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
The Planet is adapted to the temperature of 50 years ago. Evolution is going to struggle to adapt to the type of temperature changes

that scientist have been predicting for the past 50 years. It can't just be about us humans trying to keep the ocean from destroying
Takapuna Beach properties.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
Still can't find p40 let alone p47. Lets not adapt, let's just stop climate change



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
No

Notes
Stop with the adaptation, climate change will just keep coming. Other living organisms will not 'adapt'. You may want to look at carbon
sinks and removing the excess carbon that is already in the atmosphere.




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Should have paid more attention to the science 50 years ago. Good luck with saving Gaia.
