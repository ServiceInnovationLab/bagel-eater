Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Kit Howden








Reference no: 11010

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Carbon Dioxide - Reducing net carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
Need to consider behavioural changes right across all human activity especially in leisure, recreation and sport. Sport and recreation

is a major example where land use, infrastructure, transport and events has not been investigated and fully considered in its carbon
use. Sport is a large cultural social impact activity yet operates under little regard for the environment and large carbon use from land

use, clothing to activities “as of right” under a “leisure freedom” not questioned. The growth of artificial “plastic” surfaces for
specialised ball sport is a specific example illustrating that only elite groups will be able to engage in future? There will be major

changes and recreation displacement in future. The sport and recreation community has not yet fully engaged with these issues.
Behavioural and associated philosophical cultural changes need to be added to the list.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
10 Promoting the need for change of behaviour change at an individual level as the main priority. Local government needs to take a

major responsibility but also all NGOs and community groups There will be environmental conflicts and these need to be identified.
E.g moving towards a pest free NZ by 2050 will require a high use of carbon. However it can be reduced with the evidence
suggesting biodiversity may increase in the long term if evolutionary biology and some extinction is accepted.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes
Needs more behavioural expertise and a social philosopher. Far too economically and engineering orientated.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes

Need to consider behavioural changes right across all human activity especially in leisure, recreation and sport.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Will be major not possble impacts on our health, biodiversity and culture over time. Leisure needs to be also included



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Sport and recreation is a major example where land use, sea level rise, infrastructure, transport and events has not been investigated
and fully considered in its carbon use. Sport is a large cultural social impact activity yet operates under little regard for the

environment and large carbon use from land use, clothing to activities “as of right” under a “leisure freedom” not questioned. The
growth of artificial “plastic” surfaces for specialised ball sport is a specific example illustrating that only elite groups will be able to

engage in future? There will be major changes and recreation displacement in future. The sport and recreation community has not
yet fully engaged with these issues.
