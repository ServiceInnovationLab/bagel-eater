Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Jeremie MADAMOUR





Reference no: 5187

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 I think distinction of long and short lived gases doesn't make sense because "short" mean 80 years which is anyway beyond the
 time-frame we have to keep below 2°C of global warming.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 Domestic reduction are a best investment because even though it will probably cost more, the economical impact will be local.

 Moreover, it will be also investments for adaptation to global warming (more resilience for the country).



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
 ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific understanding or international agreements should be permitted.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.

 However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in scientific understanding or international agreements should be
 permitted.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
 Notes
 No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.

 However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in scientific understanding or international agreements should be
permitted.




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
It should be based on scientific facts and proven technologies.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No
Notes

As I understand it, your proposal is about a commission with no power (just advisory role) : It should have at least a power of veto on
the government budget if it doesn't comply with the 2050 goal. It could also be an other chamber of elected people with power of

decision on long term issues (climate change, but also other matters for generations to come).



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

It should have at least a power of veto on the government budget if it doesn't comply with the 2050 goal.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

I am afraid it will be always the same kind of people who have been in "policies" most of their life. It lack of people with a real
knowledge of what can effectively be done. I understand they can't all be engineers so I suggest they ALL get a minimum training on

physic (because most of them don't make a difference between a kW and a kWh!).



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
Of course, they are usually the two faces of the same coin : More resilience



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
The proposal about commission power is binary (decision power or no power at all), which will sadly influence the outcome of the

submissions you are gathering : It should have been a more open question. The commission should have at least a power of veto on
the government budget if it doesn't comply with the 2050 goal. I would like the government to explore the idea of an other chamber

of elected people with power of decision targeted on long term issues (climate change, but also other matters for generations to
come).
