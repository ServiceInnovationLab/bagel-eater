Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Melanie Miller






Reference no: 11387


Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 Clear target must be set in legislation now. We need a more ambitious target: net zero emissions by 2040. Becuase its necessary to
 act swiftly to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and avoid a global tipping point



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 It is important to address all types of greenhouse gases, including nitrous oxide, methane, HFCs and other fluorinated gases. Even
 short-lived GHGs can have signficiant effect on climate, and could trigger a tipping point. The target must cover all sources of

 emissions, including agriculture, transport, industrial activities, refrigeration/air conditioning sectors, waste, and actions that will help
 individual citizens to reduce their own GHG footprint. Activities should include significant GHG reduction actions that are not often

 addressed, such as: (a) Government policies/actions that help consumers to consume fewer goods, and avoid throw-away products
 (eg. establishing durability standards and obligatory recycling requirements for household appliances; banning single-use plastic
 bags; promoting standardised re-usable containers for drinks and food products, etc.) (b) Government policies/actions that help

 citizens to have fewer children, i.e. strong government support for family planning and birth control. Each person born in an
 industrialised country has a far larger carbon footprint than each person living in a developing country. Reducing the number of births
 in industrialised countries will have a significant impact on global emissions




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 Its important to meet national targets by reducing domestic emissions only. New forest planting should focus on native tree species

 primarily



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No

 Notes
 No, the target date cannot be put back. However, yes, it is acceptable to strengthen the target, ie. bring forward the target date for
 zero net emissions



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes

 Yes and no, based on the following conditions: I oppose Government having the ability to make changes that would make the
 emissions budget weaker or slower at addressing climate change. I support Government having the ability to make the emissions
 budget more stringent (ie. faster action to address climate change) (Your standard answers do not give enough options)
Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

Yes and no, based on the following conditions: I oppose Government having the ability to make changes that would make the
emissions budget weaker or slower at addressing climate change. I support Government having the ability to make the emissions

budget more stringent (ie. faster action to address climate change)



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

However, Highest priority should be given to environmental protection. Environmental protection must be given clear priority over the
competitiveness of specific sectors of the economy. New Zealand needs to move away from dinosaur economic sectors, and focus
on supporting sectors that will be genuinely environmentally sustainable




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
Within 6 months. A strict time frame needs to be specified.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Environmental protection should have the highest priority. New Zealand needs to move away from dinosaur economic sectors, and
focus on supporting sectors that will be genuinely environmentally sustainable




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
However, the Government should be legally required to consider and formally respond to the Commission’s advice, and provide an

explanation if they do not plan to act on it. In such cases, the Climate Change Commission should also have an obligation to provide a
public report that responds to, and critiques, the Government’s explanation. The CC Commissions’ report should specify a set of

clear action steps that would enable the Government to meet the targets and advice



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

The Climate Change Commission should have a role in advising policy for changing the NZ ETS, so that the NZ ETS scheme will
substantially reduce emissions ETS schemes are not effective if they mainly move emissions from one location to another. The NZ

ETS has been a very weak instrument to date. If the NZ ETS scheme continues, it must have clear goals for substantially reducing
GHG emissions



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No
Notes

The Commission needs to be an independent expert body, with the clear aim of providing detailed information on how to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions to net zero Members should be experts/specialists in climate change policy who also have proven

knowledge of effective activities that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions to meet the net zero goal Members must never
represent the interests of stakeholder groups or specific sectors It is only acceptable to include ETS experts if they have in-depth
knowledge of ETS schemes that substantially reduce GHG emissions. ETS schemes are not acceptable if they mainly move

emissions from one location to another.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes
Yes, provided that this does not detract from the emissions reduction work of the Commission. It may be necessary to have a

separate but linked group that reports on adaptation measures



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
Companies and organisations should be required to publish such information, eg. insurance companies, local councils, estate agents

Local councils should identify all land areas and buildings that will be subject to climate-related risks, and make that information
publicly available online and in LIM reports Estate agent property sales information should include local council’s climate change risks
for each property Much more focus should be placed on prohibiting building and development on land that is likely to experience

storm surges, flooding or significant damage arising from climate change
