Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Lynette Serjeant









Reference no: 1554

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived

 gases
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 But this should only be used to bring the target forward or speed up reductions



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 I like the PCE idea of the 6 yearly budget is better to fit in with the election cycle



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes
 However, this should not be to let ourselves, and specific sectors off the hook.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No
 Notes

 We need certainty over the next 10 years.



 Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Considerations of economic competitiveness should include economic incentives for those sectors and businesses making the
most effort and change



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes
I feel that we need to take the role further than our other Parliamentary advisory bodies (PCE, Race Relations Commissioner,

ombudsmen, etc.). This is the future of the planet we are talking about.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes

We need to be more proactive about matters such as have been exposed recently with the storms in East Coast and forestry slash.
These events should no longer be in the "we could never have guessed this" category. There are enough smart people around to

foresee such effects, and allow us to adapt in an overall less costly way.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

These functions are all important: • a national climate change risk assessment • a national adaptation plan • regular review of
progress towards implementing the national adaptation plan • an adaptation reporting power.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
I endorse the following comment from Jeanette Fitzsimons: There's nothing magical about 2050. Rapid reductions now, taking

advantage of all the easy options right away, then slowing down the rate when things get harder, will warm the climate less by 2050
than waiting till the last minute, then taking extreme action.
