Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Te Pūtahi / FESTA (Jessica Halliday)








Reference no: 10701

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 The government should set the target in law now, with the ability to make the target stronger in response to the Commission’s early
 advice. The target should be based on the most up to date climate science, on our international obligations and on principles of

 global equity (New Zealand is a wealthy, high emitting country and should do its fair share).



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 Methane must be included as well as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. I also support taking a science-based approach to ensure our
 efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing short-

 lived gases to sustainable levels. The emissions from transport, industrial activity, agriculture, and all other sources should be
 included in the target. Even ‘short-lived’ gasses can have a huge effect on our climate and need to be reduced. I support a 1.5°C net
 zero emissions target for 2040. This is because in terms of global urgency, the health gains from equitable mitigation, and especially

 fairness, the current target needs to be more ambitious, before 2040.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 including reforestation,horticultural planting and improved soil health



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 The target can only be changed by changing the Act. Under no circumstances should the 2050 target should not be altered in
 response to “economic changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty and effectiveness.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 These budgets should be set by the Climate Commission by considering: - scientific knowledge about climate change, sea level rise
 and ocean acidification - obligations under Te Tiriti o Waitangi - global leadership and international fairness



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.
 While any Government can act so NZ emits less than budgeted, emissions budgets should be able to be increased only by changing

 this law
Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

The physics of climate change comes first for setting Emissions Budgets - the bottom line is what ends up in our shared global
atmosphere and oceans, and making sure ecological tipping points are not breached. As the impacts of unmitigated climate change

will be highly regressive on New Zealanders the priority must be robust emissions budgets. The Climate Commission’s Emissions
Budgets must be consistent with the best possible chance of limiting global warming to 1.5°C degrees and the greater responsibility
of well-resourced nations like NZ, with Budget considerations limited to: A. Scientific knowledge about climate change, sea level rise

and ocean acidification B. Obligations under Te Tiriti o Waitangi C. Global leadership, including international equity19 The Commission
then advises the Government on mitigation policies (including ETS settings) for the Government plans to keep NZ’s future emissions

within the Commission’s budgets. Te Tiriti O Waitangi obligations and fairness within New Zealand are top priorities for policy and
planning. Other considerations include substantial health co-benefits and technology relevant to climate change - in ensuring a fairer,

just, sustainable Aotearoa-NZ.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
We must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change Act. The Zero Carbon Act must require the Government to respond by

publishing plans to stay within budget as rapidly as feasible within a set time limit that is certainly less than 12 months.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable,
and reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi. This means health equity is essential in planning and monitoring - all regressive

policies (including ETS settings) must be effectively offset for vulnerable communities. The substantial co-benefits to health21 from
well-designed reduction and mitigation must be considered. Other considerations include sustainable economic opportunities and
technology relevant to climate change, to grow a fairer, just, sustainable Aotearoa-NZ. The Government must work in Te Tiriti

partnership, and with NZ’s most vulnerable communities (those already disadvantaged and those working in high-emissions
industries), to create a hopeful, fairer future.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body. But also the Commission must set NZ’s Emissions Budgets – like the

Reserve Bank independently sets NZ’s Official Cash Rate. The Commission can also advise how NZ stays within these budgets, how
NZ can best adapt to climate change, and monitor progress on NZ’s emissions reductions. The Government should be legally

required to consider and formally respond to the Commission’s advice, and to provide an explanation if they do not act on it. It is also
crucial that the Commission's advice is transparent. Just like the UK Climate Commission, the NZ Commission's advice should be
released to all NZers, media and the government at the same time. The Government should not receive nor get advice on Emissions

Budgets in advance of their public release. This will allow NZers to also hold government to account, and prevent governments from
interfering or otherwise unduly influencing the Commission's independent and official advice.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

The Commission should advise the Government on ETS policy settings so that New Zealand emits within budget. It should not make
decisions itself with respect to the number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
I agree with the following collective expertise: • climate change policy (including emissions trading) • resource economics and

impacts (including social impacts, labour markets and distribution) • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori
interests • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like
planning, insurance and local government • risk management • engineering and/or infrastructure • community engagement and

communications. • business competitiveness • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology development system.
I think expertise in public health is also important and health expertise amongst Commissioners and staffing is needed too. It is also

essential that the Commission is founded on partnership with tāngata whenua and upholds obligations under Te Tiriti o Waitangi.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes
Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within the Climate Commission as adaptation must be a separate

advisory work stream, to avoid overtaking the Commission’s top priority climate mitigation role.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance is required in terms of how local councils are involved: • a
national climate change risk assessment • a national adaptation plan • regular review of progress towards implementing the national

adaptation plan • an adaptation reporting power Mitigation and adaptation are often deeply interlinked - so often mitigation and
adaptation can be addressed together in the same policy (e.g. housing). But care must be taken in designing adaptation policies to
ensure that climate-damaging emissions are not increased. Adaptation must be dealt with by a separate working group, to avoid

distraction from the top priority of mitigation. A health adaptation plan must be put in place that covers both health sector adaptation
and health-protecting adaptation in other sectors




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
Thank you for writing this Bill and preparing extensive consultation documents and public events. It is the most important Bill this

Government will pass. The transparency and independence of the Commission is vital to the success of addressing NZ's GHG
emissions in a fair and just way.
