 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Reducing emissions as quickly as possible should be the priority and people need to see the importance of this as a priority...should

be working with everyone in all sectors of society.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

Most important, goals without a working adaptation structure, are merely goals, educating communities about processes to
adaptation and the ability to put adaptation into action should be given priority, so a government lead “priority declaration” for

adaptation process will be needed, this in essence needs to be a government priority, retrofitting the existing vehicle fleet and clean
energy source industries being perhaps the two priority areas to focus on.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

More than explore should happen, sharing adaptation information should be a priority.
Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
I am attempting to launch a vehicle retrofitting project in Southland essentially creating a new industry and finding the process slow

and difficult due to the current bureaucratic process of government, so the need for a government lead "priority declaration" is seen
for such an industry to be able to move forward quickly, as there is urgency to begin the climate adaptation process, to take the

predicted 25 years to install a new fleet of EV's is a way too long timeframe, retrofitting the existing fleet would speed the process, be
a huge financial and environmental saving and provide employment at the same time, retrofitting may in fact become the best option

to replace our current ICE fleet due to global economic and trade circumstances, to not cut through the bureaucratic process could
otherwise be our downfall, a ministry official recently asked me how much would this retrofitting cost/ My response is how much will it
cost not to do so, both in an environmental and monetary sense. I wish to speak further at select committee stage about retrofitting

the New Zealand vehicle fleet.
