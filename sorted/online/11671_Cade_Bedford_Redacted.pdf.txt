Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Cade Bedford





Reference no: 11671

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes

 The targets should not be revised unless they are revised up to make them more ambitious. Alternatively the targets could be
 revised if there were significant developments in technology or science.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 Allowing budgets to be changed will change decision making and planning. This would apply to government decisions and private
 businesses. Set budgets will maintain consistency and give confidence to the private sector.




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Yes but only under exceptional circumstances



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Additional to considerations outlined in the consultation document I submit that the following matters should be considered: Tikanga
Māori, and Māori interests Co-benefits of emissions reduction measures Minimising cumulative emissions of long-lived greenhouse

gases The human and economic cost of disruptive climatic events globally but in particular across the Pacific New Zealand’s
international legal and diplomatic obligations The likelihood of carbon leakage from domestic policies The carbon embodied in
imported products consumed by households, firms and government activity in New Zealand




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
I support the Climate Change Commission having an advisory role, with mechanisms built in to hold Government to account. The

Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and
reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
I support the Climate Change Commission advising the Government of the day on policy settings in the ETS but do not support the

Commision making decisions itself. Decisions on the ETS impact businesses and New Zealanders on a large scale therefore elected
officials should be final decision makers on the ETS and accountable for those decisions.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
I agree with the proposed expertise but recommend two additions. I recommend including expertise in public health and someone
with an understanding of issues faced by at risk groups ie low income households, the elderly, and people with disabilities. The

Government will be responsible for making policies to achieve carbon budgets which will require them to make trade offs, Many of the
trade offs will disproportionally affect the most vulnerable in our society. If the Commission is to provide strong advice to the

Government on its policies it needs to be able to apply other lenses beyond a purely economic lense.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
In relation to the Climate Commission I think the Commission needs to be independent and appropriately funded. Appointment of

Commissioners should involve parliamentary oversight but the operation of the Commission should be independent. Additionally I
think the Commission could also have an educational role but would require ring fenced funding to undertake this function.

Educational expenditure is often discretionary and would likely be used by other functions of the Commission if not ring fenced. Finally
I support the inclusion of climate impact disclosure statements for new legislation but believe the Commission should provide

support to departments on this.
