 Notes




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 This should not be a political issue where a science-denying Government can change the goalposts in the future. Targets should be
 set now

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Notes



 Clause

 16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
 exposure to climate change risks?
