Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 10249

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 I targeting negative levels of CO2 and other long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 I believe the circumstances requiring a change would need to be significant changes in international politics or technology - and that

 would significant enough to warrant a full repeal of the bill



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes

 I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should take the following factors into consideration when advising on and
 setting budgets: • scientific knowledge regarding climate change • technology relevant to climate change • economic
 circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the

 economy • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on taxation, public spending and public borrowing • social
 circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel poverty • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy
 supplies and the carbon and energy intensity of the economy. The government should also consider intergenerational equity, and do

 this by not discounting action now because of perceived future economic growth. The government should also consider the impact
of climate change on pacific peoples.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be thorough, and balanced enough to not leave vulnerable

members of the community behind. They may affect certain industries more than others, and this is OK providing the government
does what it can to facilitate a transition pathway for those industries. The plans should also reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o

Waitangi.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

I agree with the following collective expertise: • climate change policy (including emissions trading) • resource economics and
impacts (including social impacts, labour markets and distribution) • Te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori

interests • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like
planning, insurance and local government • risk management • engineering and/or infrastructure • community engagement and

communications. • business competitiveness • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology development system.
I think expertise in public health is also important, and representation for pacific peoples.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance is required in terms of how local councils are involved: • a

national climate change risk assessment • a national adaptation plan • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
adaptation plan • an adaptation reporting power



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
