Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Molly Melhuish, Molly Melhuish








Reference no: 11240

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 Including separate targets for methane (short-lived) and CO2 + N2O (long-lived) Also count the sequestering of carbon in soil as well

 as trees, see Renquist submission to Productivity Commission



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 Not unless a 1.5 degree objective is shown to be necessary.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes

 Each of these should be able to be revised to be more stringent if new information indicates the need



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Each of these should be able to be revised to be more stringent if new information indicates the need



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Consider the likely impact of the decision on fuel poverty, and also (not stated in the discussion document, the likely impact of the

decision on the embodied carbon in infrastructure built - power stations require high-carbon equipment (steel, concrete and roading)
whereas thick timber construction including high-rise actually sequester carbon.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Work with a re-purposed EECA which must address climate-changing emissions as well as energy. It must re-emphasise household

energy efficiency. Must consider embodied carbon in the building of housing and infrastructure is critical - steel, concrete and roading
cause high carbon emissions. An energy-efficient-first policy would be much more employment-intensive and require less high-
energy high-carbon materials.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
A decision-making role would give too much power to its Board. Appointed Boards for energy regulation keep Comcom, EECA and

the EA beholden to the previous government's policies.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Move from "desirable" to "essential" - - knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology development system.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

Resilience is essential as climate changes, New technology is our friend! in improving resilience. Distributed energy - solar, batteries,
micro-grids, improved wood burners - make cut-off communities resilient.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Of the 4 functions listed, a national adaptation plan should include R&D to explore new-technology solutions - see above
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

NZ policy puts far too much emphasis on the ETS. Pricing incentives get overridden by special deals for favoured businesses. See
the European Directive "Energy Efficiency First‚Äù (Nov 2016) and draft Directive, "Renewable Energy" for varied policy directives to

reduce carbon emissions. They emphasise that emissions pricing needs additional support for specific sectors. Funded R&D and
demonstration is needed to kick-start markets - buildings, land use, new-technology home and institutional wood burning, and

utilisation of forestry wastes. Technology is our friend!
