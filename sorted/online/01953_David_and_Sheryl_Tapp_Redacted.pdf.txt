Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

David and Sheryl Tapp








Reference no: 1953

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes
 Set a minimum acceptable target - to be improved upon, not eroded by successive governments!



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 We should aim for the best possible result. There should be scope to accelerate our efforts to reduce climate impact. There is no

 minimum desirable temperature rise!



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 Trading is not overall reduction. It does not fulfil our individual and national responsibility.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 It should be able to be revised downwards!



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 This is an arbitrary 'stake in the ground' which at least is a longer period than an electoral cycle.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes
 Again, this is not to be an excuse to reduce the effort or expenditure on emissions reduction.




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Again, this is not to be an excuse to reduce the effort or expenditure on emissions reduction.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Provided that the balance is according to scientific and technical necessities, not upset by political expediency.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Work with all relevant sectors. Stringent attention to outcomes, with appropriate social support for individuals worst affected.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

The commission must have 'teeth".



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

The commission must engage with, and have support from the public. Here informative publicity and positive media are very
important.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes, but obviously better to avoid climate change as much as possible. "Prevention is better than cure".



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Extended to building codes, local councils (consent processes etc.), and, again, education.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Engagement of the general public is critical. This issue is not just one for a political minority. Therefore we need education and media

(even advertising) to address populist perceptions. We need to be all-encompassing - addressing the difficult issues such as
methane emissions as well as the more obvious ones (like tree planting).
