Reference no: 9701


Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 The 2050 target must be set in legislation immediately. Urgent that a climate commission and authority with teeth (working
 independently of the government) gets set up ASAP to drive NZ’s emissions reductions to meet targets set by the Paris accord.
 There is no time to waste! If BAU (Business as usual) continues the 1.5C target will be exceeded in 2 to 3 years and the 2C target in

 16 to 17 years.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived

 gases
 Notes
 The options set out by the MfE in this submission are problematic because they are not really addressing the risk posed by methane

 identified by recent scientific research. Its essential that NZ’s relatively high methane emissions are reduced as well as CO2
 emissions. The gases are very different and will require different approaches that she be overseen by a climate commission.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 The current ETS system has been a farce and has not resulted in any emissions reductions; in fact, NZ’s GHG emissions have
 increased. I suggest the ETS is scrapped in favour of a feebate system where fees paid by high emitters are passed on to zero or low

 emitters. The fee should reflect the damage being done to the atmosphere by GHG emissions and encourage and reward NZ’s
 population and industry to drastically reduce emissions to Zero carbon. Also although trees will be effective in the short term for

 reducing carbon its not a long term solution …as mentioned in question 1 …its urgent that we reduce emissions now …there is no
 time to waste. Also, worth reviewing the very sensible advice in the current Productivity Commission’s report on a “Low emissions
 economy” April 2018




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Yes ..(There is no Zero Carbon Act yet?!) However in the intervening 32 years between now and 2050 circumstances will change eg

 the science will become better known. Unfortunately, the trend is that projections of climate change are tending to become more
 and more severe as BAU continues; hopefully the public and government will be more aware and there will be a greater appreciation

 that emissions need to be reduced; newer technology may become available to help with emissions reductions.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Yes …however no information on what these might be. Will these be set by the climate commission? However, agree with any
 mechanism that results in meaningful emissions reductions consistent with Paris Accord goals and implemented ASAP.
Clause
6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

Position
Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

Notes
Yes should be able to change the 3rd budget but there must always be emissions reductions in place. Otherwise it’s a slippery slope

leading to removal of emission reductions targets.



Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes although once again I would be worried about the removal of emission reductions targets (see question 6).



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes. However, I am suspicious of the phrases on P44 concerning economic and fiscal circumstances. It would be very comfortable to
carry on with an intense carbon lifestyle which might seem to be “economically and fiscally” attractive if the damage to the
atmosphere is not factored in. However, we can no longer continue with BAU. The fact is that we have to change and change now.

Yes its going to be very hard financially but, according to the science, the longer we delay the worse it will be economically anyway, let
alone the extra damage to the planet.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes. Plans to be set by the independent Climate Commission



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Critical that the government follows the best science advice available and keeps reviewing policies as the science develops eg
separate methodologies must be used for each of the greenhouse gases, CO2, CH4 and N2O. Very important to follow progress in

other countries. The current Paris Accord pledges do not meet the RCP 2.6 target and will need to be increased. Not also that current
research shows that increases in methane concentration have not been taken into account in the data used for the Paris Accord and

that RCP 2.6 will have to be urgently revised. This has huge implications for NZ with its GHG emissions profile heavily weighted by
methane.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes. Essential that an effective Climate Commission provides this advice with data from an effective and trustworthy monitoring
programme.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes
I’ve commented on this above in 3. The current ETS has been a disaster compromised with cheap Russian and Ukrainian permits and

has resulted in no reductions in NZ GHG emissions. I recommend a feebate scheme as per my response in 3. If this cant be done
then somehow a totally transparent ETS system will need to be set up covering all aspects of NZ industry and agriculture.
Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes I agree with the criteria listed on P45. However, I think that it is essential that a significant fraction of the Climate Commission
should be staffed by engineers and scientists who understand the issues. In addition I think that it is essential that a significant

number of engaged and talented young people should be in the commission …they are the part of the population who will be most
affected by any delays in emissions reductions.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes
No!! The Zero Carbon Bill must be about the urgent pathway that NZ must take to meet and exceed pledges made for the Paris

Accord. It must follow best practice science and be strictly monitored by the Climate Commission. Adaptation is a related but very
different issue. It has to do with how the NZ population, industry and agriculture adapt to the damage already done to the Earth

System. This is more a function of advisory groups and especially local and regional councils under advice from government science
organisations. Its worth noting that the current situation is a mess with central government absolving itself of all responsibility for

adaptation leaving local councils floundering.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes I do. But this is a separate issue to the Zero Carbon Bill. Please see my comments for Q14



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes but once again this is a separate issue to the Zero Carbon Bill …please see my comments in questions above.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Drafting this bill should take into account and use the very sensible advice in the current Productivity Commission’s report on a “Low

emissions economy” April 2018
