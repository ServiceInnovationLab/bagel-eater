Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Hadyn James






Reference no: 139


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes

 As I don't believe carbon emissions affect the climate at all. None of the above



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Notes
 None of the above. The current levels are acceptable.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes
 None of the above. Don't set limits as the climate change global warming is a farce.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 The government should instead invest in removing plastics from the environment



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Notes
 No. Climate change is the latest way to tax stupid people. Climate change is a natural and normal process. Mankind could not change

 it if we tried.



 Clause
 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
 Notes
 The government should have a serious look at the science and where the money trail ends. I mean honestly how does paying a tax

 really help the environment?



 Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Notes
Again it's a farce.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
No I don't agree. Simply because these people believe in this farce. Mandatory group psychosis



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

What a massive waste of time and money. In the 1970's these sane scientists were worried about global cooling. In the 1400's
Europe suffered a mini Ice age.. I could go on. Climate change is a natural phenomenon that has been happening since the dawn of

time. Ask the dinosaurs
