Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

me, Marcus Robert Noel Newton-Howes








Reference no: 1310

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 Support must be given to businesses, families and individuals to stick-and-carrot them from their carbon-polluting ways to better
 environmentally responsible ways



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 We need to be fully committed to achieving this. What's more, we should be putting political pressure on other countries to do
 likewise.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 We need to be fully committed. There should be cross-party agreement on an ambitious target. Then we do it, no holding back.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No
 Notes

 We need to be fully committed. There should be cross-party agreement on an ambitious target. Then we do it, no holding back.



 Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The key underlying requirement is that we set and then meet a zero net emissions by 2050. Clearly this will work best when all
political parties are in agreement about that, and all Kiwis are on board. Therefore, education as to WHY this is necessary is incredibly

important. This should be taught in schools and universities, the fundamentals should be taught in TV ads and online advertising
watched by Kiwis. We need to work with parties for whom change from the status quo could be hard (the fossil fuel industry, the
farming industry - we need to keep 80% of known fossil fuel reserves in the ground, clearly no new exploration, reduce the number of

cows...) Perhaps fossil fuel companies showing that they're dismantling drilling operations and converting to solar and wind could be
given funding and tax-breaks to help them do so, and big penalties for dragging their feet if they've said that's the course they're

taking.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

it's important that no-one on the Climate Change Commission has any financial (etc) interest in the fossil fuel industry or farming
industry. Those industries are welcome in our democracy to have their say, to enter into conversation with the government and the

commission, but they should not be in a position where there's even a hint of possibly manipulation of the commission.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
