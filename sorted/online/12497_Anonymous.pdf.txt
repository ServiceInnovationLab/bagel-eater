Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill








Reference no: 12497


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 Setting a net zero emissions as 2050 target (or earlier)



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 The legislation needs to be as comprehensive and ambitious as possible.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
Apart from the broad principles of fairness, environmental sustainability etc etc, some supporting capacity building investment around

climate change (programme planning & management, systems thinking, agile approaches etc) of the public sector will be really
important. Might have the best legislation and excellent policy, but too often sub-standard implementation.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
The Government should be legally required to consider and formally respond to the Commissionâ€™s advice, and to provide an

explanation if they do not act on it.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
There needs to be a significant programme around climate (and related environmental/green) skills and workforce development. The

commission could set the framework and policy direction to assist in making this happen.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
Adaption needs to be addressed, but it is a separate body of work re implementation.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Great to finally see proper action in New Zealand on the most significant challenge we face on earth. Firstly, being among the few

countries doing this at the moment, we might need to be prepared for other (especially small) countries to be looking at us as a
model. It would be great if we could bear this in mind, and invite interested countries to learn from us and work with us - either as we

do it, or after the fact. Secondly, and also on the capability theme - who is going to implement all these great ideas? People. Is our
workforce ready with the right skills? Is our system (eg. education, training, businesses) geared up to support the people to do this
climate management, mitigation and adaption work over the next 32 years? Policy makers? Technologists? And many other types of

occupations. How can the Climate Commission influence and encourage the right and future-proofed settings for a climate
workforce?
