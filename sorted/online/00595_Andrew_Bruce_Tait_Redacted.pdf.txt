Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Andrew Bruce Tait






Reference no: 595


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived

 gases
 Notes

 Research must also continue into mechanisms for reducing or eliminating methane emissions.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes
 The primary focus should be on reducing domestic emissions. No more than 20% of our emissions reductions should come from
 purchasing overseas credits.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Only in exceptional circumstances (to be specified). This would not include a change in government.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes

 And only in exceptional circumstances (to be specified). Governments should not be allowed to change the emissions budget as a
 policy choice.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
 Notes
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

The commission should primarily be a reporting and advisory body, but the government must show how it is taking these reports and
advice into account.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Budgets must be set based on sound scientific evidence.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
It is vital that there is representation on the commission from people concerned with sustaining and enhancing our natural

environment and native biodiversity. It is far too easy to focus on people and assets and forget about the needs of ecosystems and
species.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

It is extremely important that adaptation is included in the bill. We need central government to show leadership so that regional and
local government, sectors, businesses and communities can align their own adaptation plans and actions in a coordinated way.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

I would like to see the National Adaption Plan referred to as the National Adaptation and Action Plan (NAAP). This will bring
implementable actions and timelines into the Plan that can be reported on. The Plan should also stress the importance of Regional

and Local Government, sectors, businesses and community groups aligning their own adaptation plans and actions with the National
Plan, and for their actions to feed into the national reporting process.
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

This is a very good idea.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
This is a landmark bill for NZ. Emissions targets need to be set and reported on and adaptation needs to be better aligned and

coordinated. The most important element of this bill will be that successive governments do not have the power to significantly
change the targets or the role of the commission as a policy choice (e.g. make it an election issue). NZ needs long-term certainty on

our climate change response and goals, and this will only happen if politics are not allowed to interfere.
