Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Clark Thomborson








Reference no: 10953

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 I'd expect international negotiations to continue over how our world can best respond to the climate-change issues; I'd expect our
 government to be an active and constructive participant in these negotiations; and I'd expect our government to adjust its laws and
 targets to move toward the forefront (rather than be a laggard, as at present) of international responses. For example: it is feasible to

 distinguish agricultural emissions of methane from "fossil fuel" emissions of methane and also from other major emission sources
 (e.g. landfills); there may be sound scientific reasons to make this distinction when calculating our world's progress toward stabilising

 (and then reducing!) our atmospheric CO2; other nations may or may not agree that this is appropriate (and it would certainly be in
 NZ's narrow self-interest to privilege agricultural emissions of methane over other sources); and our laws and targets should adjust
 as required to reflect any international consensus on this particular issue.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes

 ? I don't understand how it would be possible for any Government to create a budget that cannot be changed by any later
 Government (or even by itself!), except by enshrining it in a constitutional document -- and that's far out of scope for this
 consultation!



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

Our current ETS is an embarrassment on the international stage, and domestically for anyone who believes (as I do) that its
increasingly-thin coating of greenwash is an entirely inadequate response. I think the most important role for the Climate Change
Commission would be to advocate for adequate & appropriate responses by all NZ actors: governmental, for-profit organisations, not-

for-profit organisations, and individuals.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
