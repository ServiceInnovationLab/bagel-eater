Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Neil Walbran,








Reference no: 7921

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes
 My concern is that it may be premature to lock a specific long term target in too early. It would be good to have some flexibility to see

 how the science on adaptation and mitigation costs evolves as well as how the international community as a whole responds and
 what level of leadership we want to display and at what cost. My concern is that the cost of international leadership could prove to be
 quite high (as identified by NZIER modelling) and the benefits uncertain at this point. For example the most recent estimates of the

 social cost of carbon (US EPA, Nordhaus etc) suggest an optimal temperature rise (where abatement costs equal avoided damages)
 or around 3 degrees, with associated carbon costs staying below USD50/tonne. And the corresponding marginal carbon costs (of

 benefit of avoided damage over tonnes CO2 required to mitigate) of about USD15/tonne of keeping temperature rise below 1.5
 degrees rather than 2 degrees. These global benefits are much lower than our projected costs (upto NZD2000/tonne) for
 leadership. So it is not clear that our leadership would be effective, or even if it was internationally effective (spurred everyone on to

 aim for 1.5 degrees) that this would be a globally optimal outcome. Both of which lead me to conclude that the benefits of very strong
 international leadership may not outweigh our national costs. So some flexibility to manage our targets as the effectiveness and cost

 of our international leadership become clearer would be important.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 I would prefer to let the Climate Change Commission have some flexibility to vary the target as more information becomes available.
 The legislation could set some guiding principles around doing our bit to meet collective international targets etc.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes

 I think having access to international carbon markets as a safety valve for carbon prices is important. However we will need to
 proactively work to develop these markets and their integrity. As they are pretty limited in scope and some integrity questions remain.
 My own research suggests other countries could exceed their current NDC's at much lower relative cost than NZ. For example the

 marginal cost for India to exceed its current NDC, by building gas (CCGT) rather than coal fired power stations to meet its poverty
 reduction goals is about NZD20/tonne of CO2. Much lower than the up to NZD2000/tonne carbon prices identified in the NZIER

 modelling.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 It should be able to be revised if: New science information on climate change mitigation or adaptation comes to light, or New
 Zealand's economic, or relative economic position changes.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 I favour slightly shorter periods. With the first (5 year) period being fixed, come limited flexibility on the second 5 year budget, and the

 third 5 years being indicative only. This is to allow flexibility as more information comes to light, as above.
Clause
6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

Position
Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
Notes

See above, I would prefer them to even have some (limited) flexibility on the second budget.



Clause

7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes, see above. Including new science information or economic circumstances.



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

But the plans should include analysis of costs and impact on other spending priorities.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Costs and impact on other spending priorities.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

But I would also like to see a high degree of independence in the process to appoint them.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

But the process it uses to make these recommendations should be transparent and consultative.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

And would add a high degree of independence in the appointment process.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

Very strongly support adaptation to be included. I would go further and suggest that in making recommendations on carbon budgets
the climate change commission should consider costs of NZ adaptation in balance with our mitigation costs.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
But suggest that as implementation of adaptation will mostly be at local rather than central government level (as local government
owns most of the affected infrastructure) that local government should be strongly involved in designing and implementing these

new functions.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
Notes

Qualified agreement here as I wouldn't like to see the reporting requirements overly increase the overhead of businesses.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
My key concern with the bill is the potential to lock in very high costs of ambitious leadership in climate change mitigation when the

effectiveness of our leadership is uncertain and the global benefits of more ambitious mitigation targets, should our leadership be
effective, is also uncertain. This is not to say we shouldn't do something, and some aspects of the bill, such as the climate change

commission and a strong emphasis on adaptation have strong merit. I would just like to see some flexibility to manage our future
commitments as new information comes to light.
