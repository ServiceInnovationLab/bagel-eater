Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Leonardus Cornelis Ratten






Reference no: 2096


Submitter Type:    Unspecified / Other

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 Methane is a particular concern as it is approximately 30 times more potent a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. The argument

 that methane "goes away" is spurious, as methane does not go away but rather degrade to carbon dioxide. Therefore methane must
 be legislated at least as strongly as carbon dioxide, preferably more so.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes
 Unless it is to reduce the emissions budget, the emissions budgets should not be changed.




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No
 Notes




 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No

 Notes
 The agricultural sector must not be allowed to get away with their pollution. This is a significant problem for our own, and future
 generations, as such loopholes must not be made and all New Zealanders pull together for the goal of zero net emissions before

 2050.



 Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Agriculture must be brought to the table and their emissions reduced along with all other sectors.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Though we should have a stated target of 2040 as this is an urgent concern.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

The Climate Change Commission must have mechanisms to hold government, industry and agriculture to account.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Knowledge of climate and environmental science is of utmost importance.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Please don't let agriculture avoid their responsibilities. We cannot allow agriculture to pollute without the same restraints put on the
rest of industry and keep face on an international level.
