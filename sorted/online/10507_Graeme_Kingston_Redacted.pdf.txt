Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Graeme Kingston, Graeme John Kingston








Reference no: 10507

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes
 It seems more sensible to be less aggressive regarding short lived gasses as these could be considered to 'recycle' over a relatively
 short period of time.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
Some flexibility should be built in to early legislation to allow for changes/modifications once we see how the system operates as

there will more than likely be consequences or behaviours that are not foreseen. Your discussion document talks about forestry and
that trees soak up carbon dioxide and seems to suggest that this is released again the minute the tree is cut down - this is surely not

true, it would only happen over time as the wood decomposes or is burnt. If it stays in its 'wood' state the carbon dioxide remains
locked up. While a tree is in its growing state it should be counted every year as part of the carbon offset. The discussion document

also refers to commitments under the Paris Agreement as being a reason to do something, there are clearly no binding commitments
if the USA can pull out of it with no repercussions.
