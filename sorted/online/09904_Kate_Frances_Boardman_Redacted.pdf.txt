Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Kate Frances Boardman






Reference no: 9904


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 However, I support a more ambitious target of net zero by 2040.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 I support the most ambitious target: reducing greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050, but would prefer a 2040 target if possible. I
 also support taking a science-based approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible: we should aim
 for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 The New Zealand net zero carbon target should be met by domestic reductions only. However New Zealand has international

 responsibilities and should be supporting and assisting in mitigation and adaptation in developing countries through mechanisms
 such as additional aid or perhaps purchasing carbon credits. Emphasis should be placed on reducing fossil fuel based emissions as

 soon as possible. The Zero Carbon Act should also provide a framework for transparency and accountability around New Zealand's
 international climate finance.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No

 Notes
 The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
 ability to revise the 2050 target to be more ambitious, in light of major changes in scientific understanding or international

 agreements should be permitted.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that three are in effect at all times.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes
 Emissions budgets should not be altered in response to “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty. However,

 the ability to revise the 2050 target to be more ambitious, in light of major changes in scientific understanding or international
 agreements should be permitted.
Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Emissions budgets should not be altered in response to “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty. However,
the ability to revise the 2050 target to be more ambitious, in light of major changes in scientific understanding or international

agreements should be permitted.



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should take the following factors into consideration when advising on and

setting budgets: • scientific knowledge regarding climate change • technology relevant to climate change • economic
circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the

economy • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on taxation, public spending and public borrowing • social
circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel poverty • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy

supplies and the carbon and energy intensity of the economy. We also need to consider our obligations under Te Tiriti o Waitangi as
well as Fairness (intergenerational justice and a just transition), cost-effectiveness, comprehensiveness and environmental

sustainability.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
We must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable,

and reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi. In setting plans to meet the emissions budgets, the government should be: •
consulting and working with Local Government to encourage them to mitigate and adapt to climate change • considering the relative
consumption emissions and other environmental impacts when weighing up mitigation and adaptation measures e.g. the emissions

cost of producing electric cars overseas • considering the impact of its adaption and mitigation measures on other planetary
boundaries i.e. biodiversity, nutrient pollution. • taking into account New Zealand’s contribution to international aviation and maritime

emissions. • making sure they're based on the best science available • ensuring that they deliver fair outcomes for Kiwis • reflecting
the principle of a Just Transition for workers • honouring Te Tiriti o Waitangi • being environmentally sustainable, especially for New

Zealand's unique native plants and animals • maximising the impact of money spent and being cost-effective • encouraging
innovation • unlocking economic opportunities for New Zealanders, such as in renewable energy • honouring our international
commitments, including under the Paris Agreement • consulting people who may be economically affected, like farmers or

businesses • consulting tangata whenua • consulting young people, who'll live to see more of the impact of climate change •
consulting communities already facing the physical impacts of climate change




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
I believe that the Commission should not be a decision-making body. I support the Climate Commission having two functions 1.

Providing expert advice and 2. Monitoring our progress and holding the government account. It should not be a decision-making
body as it would lead to a lack of democratic accountability, it becoming a comprised watch dog and that it would not have the ability

to implement comprehensive policy plans.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to

the number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

I agree with the following collective expertise: • climate change policy (including emissions trading) • resource economics and
impacts (including social impacts, labour markets and distribution) • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori
interests • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like

planning, insurance and local government • risk management • engineering and/or infrastructure • community engagement and
communications. • business competitiveness • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology development system.

I also think expertise in public health is also important. Consideration should be given to representation by young people, minority
groups and respected non-experts.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within the Climate Commission.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

I agree with the proposed functions below: • a national climate change risk assessment • a national adaptation plan • regular review
of progress towards implementing the national adaptation plan • an adaptation reporting power Care will need to be taken in

managing the interaction between national and local government roles.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
Yes. This would let the government and the public know about the risks to public and other infrastructure, and make these

organisations better informed about the risks they face.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

I am concerned about climate change and am very supportive of action to mitigate and adapt. As a Christian, I believe that we, as
people, have a call to care for God’s creation and to care for all peoples. This means supporting maximum ambition including meeting
net zero by 2040 domestically as well as supporting mitigation and adaption overseas especially with our Pacific neighbours. I am

supportive of taking action to limit warming to 1.5° C, since it has been those with privilege and opportunities who have made the
most out of fossil fuels, but it is those who have the least who will be the most disadvantaged by climate change. I believe that we

need to leave the world in a better place and I think that this bill will help with that.
