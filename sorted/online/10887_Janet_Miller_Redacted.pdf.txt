Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Janet Miller








Reference no: 10887

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 No time is short . before climate change is catastrophic. We need to set a target, form a plan to reach the target, stick to the plan. If

 we don't act now and set a meaningful target,it will be too late. The only way it should be revised is to make the changes sooner.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Its often easier to break targets into smaller targets. I would like assurances that all Parties will stick to the plan. NZ could be a leader

 in the Southern Hemsphere.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 Climate change affects us all. Every New Zealander, our Pacific neighbours, the World population. The emissions budget should be
 part of a long term plan to stabilise climate change. There will be a need for us all to change behaviour, some industries and
 individuals will need to change more. They should be supported through these changes long term. All Political Parties should agree

 with and stick to the planned budget. There should be no adjustments or changes for short term popularism.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
No This is a long term plan, as stated above change will be hard and no doubt the government will be under pressure to respond to

those most effected. If industry and business are aware of the possibility of moveable targets they are much less likely to fully apply
themselves to achieving the target in the first place




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
especially the statement about being transparent and predictable while undertaking its functions.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

Goal setting should always include TIMELY !



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

NZ is so blessed with renewable energy sources. Could the government support solar panels in selected state
houses/schools/hospitals. Initially in sunny regions eg Hawkes Bay /Nelson any extra power going to community batteries. Could you

consider a Nationalised renewable electricity company with the option of individuals producing more power than they need donating
it to their local community for use in schools/hospitals/resthomes etc ie incentives to get the local community thinking about how
their actions can positively impact others in their neighbourhood Promote electric transport, more charging points




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

It's important that an independent scientific climate commission sets the targets. As previously stated tackling climate change needs
to a longterm plan not subject to changing political moods




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Would love to see a "science communicator"role in their (? even an intern) as need to make the goals and plan easy to understand

and get behind



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Notes
Its part of the big picture




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

lets work together



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
To get all NZers behind the Goals they need to understand how emissions cause climate change. More public education/information

is needed.
