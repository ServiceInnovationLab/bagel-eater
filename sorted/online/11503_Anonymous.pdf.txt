Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 11503

Submitter Type:    Unspecified / Other

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Carbon Dioxide - Reducing net carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2050
 Notes

 short-lived gasses (methane) remain a major problem because they are constantly produced by agriculture and have a much higher
 negative impact per molecule



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 We must take responsibility for our actions and set an example for the world.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
Yes

Notes
However, factors such as "economic circumstances" need extreme caution. Changing our activity regarding the climate requires

changes to our economic and business motivation. We will need to see significant shifts in the way we prioritise and do business to
ensure carbon emission and other environmental issues are not put in second place to dollar earnings.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The Government needs to place this policy at the heart of developments so that all aspects of New Zealand life take on board the

absolute need for a change in the way we behave. Everyone will need to contribute whether it by farmer and her cows, or urban
travellers and their cars. Government needs to clear with the population that there is really no space for debate about carbon

emissions and the attendant issues, because the alternatives for biodiversity and global environmental process are too awful to
consider. In some way we need to engender a sense of wartime stoicism and grit so that nation takes pride in contributing.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

However, it depends on numbers. The CCC should comprise experts on the issues rather than emphasising the uptake or social
"adaptation". Those are critical elements that certainly need to be addressed well, but thinning down the scientific expertise of the

CCC to accomodate all skills would, I think, be a disadvantage. A subsidary implementation team should be charge with identifying the
best was to action objectives of the CCC.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes

I suspect this will complicate the matter. The bill needs to focus on the environmental problem and solution, and note that
appropriate and substantial efforts will be needed for the social change needed.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause
