Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Martin Evans








Reference no: 9490

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes
 It is important that all goals are acheiveable and that there are intermediate goals within the overall framework



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases
 Notes

 Zero carbon dioxoide emissions are unachievable in my view. All animals for example expel carbon dioxide as part of their metabolism.
 Humans expelling 4% in each breath. It is important to focus on significant reductios based on the WHOLE energy and carbon cycle

 not just a part of it. So for example Acukaldn Council pressed ahead with a household composting idea despite it being higher in
 carbon emissions. In the Uk they are going back to coal fired power stations as they have found that wood based stations result in
 higher carbon dioxide emissions.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 It is preferable to use our our resources. Also what of the effect of the oceans in our economic zine. Surely these should be included

 as part of the equation as if for example someone choses to grow seaweed of particular types that are better at reducing carbon
 emissions. If forestry is to be used then the whole of life effects must be considered. Also as well as forestry- riparian panting has the
 double benefit of carbon emission control and also improvement in stream quality




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 There is still unfortunately too much doggy science (regrettably often form left wing or green groups) pushing certain solutions which
 after some time have been found to be flawed because the science is unsound. Landfill methane emissions being one. There is
 virtually NO methane emissions form well run landfills as the gas is collected and burnt and bacteria readily treat the methane in the

 capping areas (I have proven this in many field trials).



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 There needs to be some measure in place to track management of emissions



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes
 There needs to be some flexibility as events, economies change and science knowledge improves, However any change needs to

 be with a majority of say 75% of Parliament representative members.
Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Notes
See comment above




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Notes
Any consideration that involves any significant expenditure as a result of changes in climate change effects needs to be

independently verified by a group of scientists, pracgmatists and accountants before adoption. There should be no political
interference or addition of politically motivated topics as we cannot afford to waste time resolve the climate change issues.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

One needs a plan and programme



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Only work with reliable science and DO take the whole of life cost effects into account not just effects over the timeframe of various
plans.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

Any allocation must have an review by an independent body. Should there be a disagreement then the final decision would ride with
the minister.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Imperative that one has practical minded scientists; and preferably NO politically or envionmentally driven members.Namely it is all too

important now to have highly competent people with the right unbias approach to resolve climate change issues.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
And must require a whole of life provision so that the full carbon footprint can be determined.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

The functions must include regular independent reviews to ratify all substantive decisions. The committe members should be as
company directors and only have tenor on an elected basis but certain role "areas" (such as science advisors or industry advisory).

Namely people will be elected to each role area.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
Often there are unintended consequences which sometimes can only be assessed if anyone can make submissions to have inputs.




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Effects of Climate Change are still not well understood. There needs to be a mandatory aspect that the Committee publishes regular

easy to read progress reports and publicity on progress suitable for children through to adults as it are the next few generations that
are likely to be most seriously affected by decisions
