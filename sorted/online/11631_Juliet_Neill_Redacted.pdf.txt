Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Juliet Neill, Priscilla JULIET NEILL








Reference no: 11631

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 My reservation is that, given the urgency with which scientists agree we should act, that the target should be brought forward to
 2030. The target date must definitely not be pushed further away.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 The aim should be for negative CO2 emissions. Whilst short lived gases, such as methane could be seen to be less of a threat, they

 are in fact much more damaging for the period in which they are around. To stabilise them is not an option, particularly as fossil
 methane is now being released in the Arctic tundra, thus further increasing damaging emissions. If levels are to be stabilised, to what

 level should they be stabilised? This has not been made clear. Short lived gases much be reduced to net zero as well.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 Carbon trading can be used to shrug off our responsibilities to reduce. We must do our own work to reduce greenhouse gases.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 But only if the date is moved to a sooner one. It must certainly be no later than 2050, and if at all possible moved to 2030.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 However, provision of 3 year budgets could be allowed, as circumstances change and new evidence is brought to light. The time
 period should definitely not be extended.




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 Exceptions should be made when more scientific information suggests that a budget should be revised. The time period should not
 be extended, but could be shortened.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

As outlined in previous questions. Budgets must not be cut, but there can be provision for increasing allocations.



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

The following should be taken into account when allocating budgets. - Scientific knowledge with regard to climate change. -
Technology as it appertains to climate change - Economic and fiscal circumstances independent of the free market, growth paradigm.
Energy choices and their impact on the economy. People on low incomes should not be disproportionately disadvantaged.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
There must be a strict timeframe for producing a plan - the sooner the better.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
We have a crisis on our hands and we are near the point of no return. So extreme urgency is called for. A whole shift in the economic
system is called for, and in order to effect change, we have to move from a growth economy to a circular economy.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
This is a difficult one. If the Commission is purely advisory, then there needs to be some assurance that successive governments can

not choose to ignore whatever advice is given in favour of short term profit, or to appease other governments and corporations.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Notes

The ETS simply allows us to shirk our responsibility to take meaningful action, and thus should be abandoned. The Commission
should act in an advisory role that promotes real change, not carbon trading.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Expertise required must involve top scientist, economists, environmental and town planners, those with community knowledge,

representation from the business community, tangata whenua, those involved in health and social change.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
This might require a sub-committee who are able to work in with local councils.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Once again, please respond to the urgency of the situation and implement action as soon as humanly possible.
