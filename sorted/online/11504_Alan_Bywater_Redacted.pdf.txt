Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Alan Bywater








Reference no: 11504

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 I think we should aim for an ambitious target. That way if we don't make it to achieve the target exactly we will still have achieved a
 great deal.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes
 This is a pragmatic approach and potentially rewards organisations in other countries where their greenhouse gas reduction targets

 have been exceeded.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 But only in very extreme circumstances. It should not be possible for Governments to change the target for political expediency
 reasons.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 But again only in very exceptional circumstances. The legislation needs to have sufficient measures to stop a future government

 making changes when the circumstances are not exceptional.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes
This sort of measure is required to avoid governments ignoring the Commission's advice if they do not agree with it.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
The Commission needs to provide advice on both climate change mitigation and adaptation.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

It is important to have commissioners with expertise in climate change adaptation. Commissioners who have good local government
experience will also be important as often local government will be at the sharp end of adaptation decisions at a local level.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

Very much. Government needs to take a lead in climate change adaptation and work with local communities to help them bring
adaptation about.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
I believe the national climate change risk assessment and the requirement to develop a National Adaptation Plan are very important
parts of this proposed legislation. It is important that Government sets the overall direction for the National Adaptation Plan but work

closely with local government, local communities and organisations to both create and implement the Plan.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
However, the costs and administrative burden of doing so should be minimised. It is important that the Commission and the

Government have a good picture of what is happening in the adaptation space across a range of organisations. The reporting
requirement should be integrated with existing reporting requirements e.g. Annual Reports rather than creating an additional

reporting process.
