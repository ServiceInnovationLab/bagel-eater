Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill














Reference no: 11730

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 I think that saying because methane is a "short-lived gas" and therefore should not be included in a reduction target is a compete
 abrogation of what we need to do. Just because methane is a "short-lived gas" in no way means we must not reduce its emissions

 right now. If we permit methane to be emitted at the same levels now, it is still going to have a dramatic effect (up to 12 times more
 potent than carbon dioxide, I hear), as we will continue to pump the same amounts out... It is not going to solve the crisis! Methane
 *must* be included in greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Yes, but only by bringing forward the deadline -- we must not allow the target to be pushed further into the future.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 I have selected "No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed", but I do think that it should be permissible to *reduce*

 future budgets, and those are the only changes that should be permitted. I am totally against allowing future budgets to be
 increased.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes, but only downwards.



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes, but with caveats. Considerations over economic and fiscal circumstances are all well and good, but these must not be permitted
to be given primacy over social and environmental circumstances. For example, if there is a decision to be made with have both a
better and a worse economic outcome, but an inversely affected social or environmental outcome, then the better social or

environmental outcome should be chosen, rather then the better economic outcome.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes
Yes, absolutely. Without a clear, transparent and public statement of intent on how budgets will be achieved, they will be

meaningless.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

It is of utmost importance that the role of tangata whenua must be strongly considered ad respected. Pakeha have come to Aotearoa
New Zealand in greatly dispossessed Maori of their tino rangatira. Maori have a guardianship role over Aotearoa, and that role must

not be put aside in any way.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

The Government should have to publicly respond to, and provide rationale when it deviates from the Commissionâ€™s advice. The
Climate Commission should also act as an independent watchdog, publishing progress reports and highlighting problems.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes
The government should be removed from choosing how may ETS units are available, since the government will necessarily be open

to political influence.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes
Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
