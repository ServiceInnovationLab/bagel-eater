Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Margaret, Margaret Mollison









Reference no: 9378

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 Preferably two, but pragmatically only if needed - three, with careful safeguards, aware that historically these have been at times a
 sham which has also depressed the value of national carbon units.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 Ideally we should have an absolute target.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
There needs to be a strong cooperative model between national government and local authorities. This is especially important in the

area of transport which is one of the leading causes of carbon emissions. National and local government need a coordinated and
fiscal response to transport needs including commitment to cycleways, walkways, public transport and electric vehicles and their

servicing as well as less reliance on transport using carbon based fuels. In addition there needs to be a unified approach to creating
vibrant city centres which support the arts, sport and community involvement. This will have impacts on reducing the need for wider

travel including to overseas destinations, plane travel being another huge contributor to carbon emissions. The above changes have
spin off effects on improved health and well being with such things as an increase in exercise, social connection and well being and a
reduction in obesity rates. There also needs to be collaboration with other ministries such as the Ministry for Primary Industries and

Ministry of Health. There will be wide reaching effects on all levels of NZ society such as an increase in diseases spread by
mosquitoes, and collaboration and information sharing will help to plan for and mitigate some of these consequences. Community

groups also need to be consulted including, but not restricted to, farmers, iwi, forestry owners, the business community, schools, AA
etc



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
But I would put business competitiveness on the essential list, and also an understanding of social policy for example social capital,

happiness quotas.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

The elephant in the room is the farming industry which in NZ contributes 60% to our greenhouse gas emissions and currently is not
included in the ETS. Obviously farming is an important cornerstone to our economy so any change needs to be done in a respectful

and mindful way. Options could include a commitment, in collaboration with the MOH, encouraging vegetable based diets with the
inherent spin-off effects of improved health such as a reduction in heart disease and bowel cancer. Also there could be commitment

to funding R&D into less methane-producing feed for stock and for genetic selection for less gas producing breeds. Another option
is proactive support for changing land use such as converting farms to horticulture or forestry. This could have further benefits on
water and air quality, especially tree planting on waterways.
