 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes



 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Often times Environmental and Climate Change policy is neglected among major political parties due to the benefits of the policy only
 taking effect in the distant future. Governing bodies should optimistically plan to achieve the 2050 goal by implementing short term

 goals in which the benefits are foreseeable within a given election cycle(s).



 Clause
 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

 Notes
Policy and planning needs to be holistic. All ministries and departments need to develop the common interest to introduce policy to

combat climate change.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Clause

Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
There is a clear divide between how the environment should be valued between New Zealanders. This is reflected in the varying
attitudes that individual MPs and Ministers have towards specific Environmental and Climate Change policies. In order to successfully

reach the goal of being carbon neutral by 2050, it is absolutely necessary that the philosophy of sustainability is integrated into every
Ministry and Department. If the introduction to Climate Change legislation is not introduced holistically, there may be a possible risk of

conflicting ideology between the Climate Change Commission and other government entities. Progressing towards a carbon neutral
economy is highly beneficial towards contemporary New Zealand society. With untouched natural landscapes as the main attraction,

tourism is one of the largest industries in New Zealand. There is a significant importance towards the Government to endorse the
most up to date Environmental Policy in order to maintain the quality of destinations to both domestic and international visitors.
Eradicating the dependence on a fossil fuel economy will also allow greater national self sufficiency, and localised industries. This is

highly important for an isolated country developing in an economy with ever diminishing resources.
