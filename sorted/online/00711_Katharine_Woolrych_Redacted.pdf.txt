Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Reference no: 711

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes
 It is essential that the government legislate a fixed and binding target immediately - we have no time to lose.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 We cannot afford to ignore the 49% of our emissions profile that come from methane as a result of agriculture. While methane is

 short lived, it traps 34 times more heat over a 10 year period. Nitrous oxide is also long-lived and despite existing in small
 concentrations, trap 298 times more heat. Addressing the problems within our agriculture and dairy industry could not only help us

 avoid the most disastrous effects of climate change sooner but could also help us address other harm currently being done to our
 environment - for instance waterway pollution and soil over-nutrification. Furthermore, our knowledge about the dangers of these
 other gases is limited, considering CO2 gets something like 100 times the funding and number of published academic papers. We

 must accept that our emissions profile is different to other countries but see the challenges this poses as unique opportunities to
 become world-leaders.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 Relying on international carbon credits risks shifting responsibility away from our domestic emissions - like all countries, we need to
 do our bit to address the damage WE have created.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes

 No - this act needs to ensure changes of government and shifts in political mood. No matter what the political 'circumstances' are,
 climate change will remain the biggest challenge we as a nation face today.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes



 Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
Considerations of scientific knowledge (i.e. the risks posed by climate change) should take priority over 'economic circumstances',
'fiscal circumstances' and other short-term concerns. While fuel poverty for instance is a real concern, it must be considered in the

context of the long-term threat a lack of substantive action on climate change poses.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
