Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Linda Christine Dear








Reference no: 9705

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 However, I think some companies/areas of our economy may only be able to achieve low emissions rather than zero, so I think an
 overall balance is important. Ensuring that real change is made towards our goals, but allowing for some leeway in what may be a
 realistic expectation from some industries/companies. I guess 'net zero' means an overall result - not per business.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Advice from the Climate Change Commission. Any industries such as transport, forestry, farming, manufacture, etc. that are likely to
have high impacts on emissions production/reduction. I think a holistic approach is important - looking at all aspects &

considerations.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

I think it is important to have very good science advice; as well as having a balanced expertise group, so that advice is practical and
sensible. Commissioners with expertise but not vested interests.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
I think a risk assessment and adaption plan are important as things are always changing and so priorities in responding to the effects

of climate change will need to change. In some areas the effects of flooding may become extreme; perhaps we might need to reduce
the use of petrol, etc.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
I'm very keen to see this bill passed so we in NZ are doing our bit to meet the goals of the world as well as making our own country

more efficient and greener in all we do. I had some reservations about the description 'carbon zero', despite the word 'net' being
added as we need carbon and carbon dioxide as part of life on the planet. Which is why I think it is important to have balanced

scientific advice as part of the work done to make the changes needed. It is important to act now and to focus the thinking of
industries towards reduced emissions (and not just trade units to avoid real change). I was recently disappointed to hear that

although Wellington now has a new bus fleet, I understand many buses are still run on diesel - why are they not electric! I heard it was
because of cost. Is it possible that the government may provide funding to assist companies to make changes that are better for the
environment but which they have avoided because of the cost? Also I understand changes are happening in the farming sector - cool

to read about Ngai Tahu Farming, but I would like to see a strong encouragement, and possible financial support, for diversification in
farming so dairying is not expanded to a huge extent. I am also keen on the government taking greater action in the area of waste

reduction, although this is perhaps not the focus of this submission. Thank you for the opportunity to comment.
