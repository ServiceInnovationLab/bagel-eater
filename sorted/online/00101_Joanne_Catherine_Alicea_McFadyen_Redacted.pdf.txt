 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes
 We've wasted too much time arguing about. Just get the target legislated now.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 We need to rethink the social structure to be zero emissions inclusive all sectors.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 We need to stand on our own footing of emissions.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 Theres no going back. The environment cannot be used for other exploitation.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 This needs to be a step process but I would want these 'budgets' legislated so that ALL political parties must adhere to them.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Any room to move...socio-political dynamics will change them if possible.

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
