Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Amos Mann









Reference no: 11686

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes

 Remove the target from risk of political influence, instead and independent body is best - especially to respond to new research, and
 rapid changes in economics, and climate science, nationally and internationally



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 Because the options are all 'net' rather than 'gross', we need to offset the impact of actual emissions. The 'net' measurement should

 be made on science of impact on climate change



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 Once we have reached net emissions, we should then allow for trading, but not before - this would put NZ at a competitive advantage
 in the market.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Yes, but the goal and underlying principle and purpose must be protected. As new research and new science is undertaken, of
 course we will need to have the ability respond - but this should be de-politicizied, and be the charge of a climate commission.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 That sounds reasonable - basically you need about this level of stability to have a predicable economic basis for investment. OR the
 independent climate commission could set the budget on a quarterly basis like the Reserve Bank does with the OCR. That level of

 control seems to keep most people happy.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes

 The government shouldn't be allowed to change the budget - the climate commission should be able however, to in the same way
 as the Reserve Bank is in control of the OCR - but with a different set of success criteria being monitored.
Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

No, if there are exceptional circumstances, they just need to make up for the short fall once the circumstances are no longer
exceptional. The Government don't get to change the OCR in exceptional circumstances as much as they would like to. When faced

with exceptional economic circumstances the Government borrows money - and then they have to pay it back - that's the nature of a
balanced system, just as is required to mitigate climate change - we need to work within the ecosystem.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

However, these factors should be considered in terms of how they might impact NZ's ability to reduce or offset emissions, and
should not be considered in-and-of-there-own-right: - economic circumstances and, in particular, the likely impact of the decision on

the economy and the competitiveness of particular sectors of the economy • fiscal circumstances and, in particular, the likely impact
of the decision on taxation, public spending and public borrowing • social circumstances and, in particular, the likely impact of the

decision on fuel poverty • energy policy and, in particular, the likely impact of the decision on energy supplies and the carbon and
energy intensity of the economy



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

Absolutely - the election conversation needs to shift from parties campaigning on 'if' they will act on climate change, to parties
campaigning on 'what' they will do to act on climate change.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Other environmental impact - e.g. what kind of trees are being planted? are these monocultures? Or diverse ecosystems that are

being planted? Social Wellbeing Whole of life impact of projects/actions Iwi If two actions have the same emissions reduction/trade-off
- then consideration on greatest benefit for economy, employment, and ROI



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No
Notes

I think greater emphasis on climate scientist expertise is required - do you need an atmospheric chemist for example? That seems
like a key area of expertise required to keep up with research in this area. Engineering and technologist expertise is required also -

there will be many technologies the commission will need to review and consider - and many sham technology solutions that will
need to be discounted.
Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
NO, that is a different set of actions that should happen in parallel and concert, but adaptation is a local concern, climate change

action has a global impact.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes these are important - but I believe they should be decoupled from the core goal to reduce emissions, rather than conflated. This
feels like a different bill required on Adaptation



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
Sure, but this feels like a different bill required on Adaptation.
