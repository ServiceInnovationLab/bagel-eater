 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 Not sure why this question even is asked. How can we not set a target now and comply with the Paris accord?



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 Again, this seems to be a no-brainer. We have to aim for the best outcome, and to do that we must include all gases.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 I don't agree with using cheaply available offsets to pay for pollution emitters in our country. This is counter to the principle of user
 responsibility.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Notes

 Who knows what can happen in the next 30 years. Nothing can be set in stone. We may find an asteroid wipes life off our planet. In
 that instance, yes I think we can relax our climate change target.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Notes

 Not fussed here either way.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Notes
 Again, is this something we really need to consult on.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes

 Why?



 Clause
 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
 Notes
 Not sure. This seems an entirely vague and meaningless question. Would you like me to write an essay on how I propose the Climate

 Commission to operate?
Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

Is the NZ ETS really the answer? If it hasn't worked in even a remotely successful way, then let's scrap it and move to carbon tax.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

Absolutely. Mitigation and adaptation work hand in hand. Let's get on with it.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

Haven't read this, and not sure I have the capacity too read it. It would have been nice to have the relevant passages inserted here.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Notes

Not even sure what this means. But it sounds like you are suggesting sharing information and listening to people. Again, is this really
something you need reassurance that it is needed?




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Get on with it, and put up some real strawman questions that we can practically comment on. Where are the questions re agricultural
emissions? What are the implications for the economy on an all gases scenario? Would it entail a radical move from pastoral

agriculture? Is it better for NZ to feed the world on its relatively low carbon agricultural model, or should we reduce our production and
emissions to the level that we can manage on a consumption basis? (Refer to the consumption model for carbon emissions that MfE

reports on and is referenced in the Thinkstep anaylsis https://www.thinkstep.com/content/carbon-footprint-new-zealands-built-
environment-hotspot-or-not , ie 19% from nutrition, 20% from built environment and 44% from transport, which is radically different

from how we report to the IPCC). Secondly, please don't undervalue the change that can be undertaken by individuals and
communities, particularly in relation to energy emissions. Include energy on a consumption basis (as above, 20%) and give relative
emphasis to buildings, which according to the IPCC has the biggest potential for reducing carbon emissions, largely because they are

so inefficient compared with transport and industry. (Refer https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-
report/ar5/wg3/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter9.pdf : In summary, buildings represent a critical piece of a low-carbon future and a global

challenge for integration with sustainable development (robust evidence, high agreement). Buildings embody the biggest unmet
need for basic energy services, especially in developing countries, while much existing energy use in buildings in developed

countries is very wasteful and inefficient. Existing and future buildings will determine a large proportion of global energy demand.
Third, take into account behaviour change as well as improvement in energy efficiency when designing those interventions. The way
we use our buildings, cars, and especially our attitudes towards overseas travel, is at least as important as making those

modes/infrastructure more efficient to operate. Otherwise we risk taking those savings back in increased consumption.
