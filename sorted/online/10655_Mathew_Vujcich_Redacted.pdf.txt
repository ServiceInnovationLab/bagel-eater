Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Mathew Vujcich








Reference no: 10655

Submitter Type:

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 This is an issue that needs addressing immediately and enough obfuscating and delay has occurred already.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 Nitrous oxides is not on the scheduled list and is a key gas missing in the targets. Why??



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 Face up to what we are doing and have done and be a world leader in accepting responsibility even though NZ makes a small
 contribution on a percentage basis.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Thirty plus years is a long time. However a revision should not be able to allow any relaxation in reaching this target. Any revision

 should allow for new science /technological advance or achi achieving the target earlier.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 I would support a full 15 year budget with 5 year reviews. This would be more transparent and perhaps less likely to be interfered

 with.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No
 Notes
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

This will help hold government to account.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

As wide a range of industries affected as possible, Kia and groups who have a natural interest in representing our environment. Use
of urea and nitrous oxide needs to be included in the impacts of greenhouse gases.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Perhaps with the power to s fond in expertise as well.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
This would complicate things too much



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

We need transparency and this is a mechanism that may help with this.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
I feel that there is not enough knowledge or buy in to the impacts of greenhouse gases in general by New Zealanders. Industry
seems to be reluctant to take the lead - noticeably transport and agriculture. Only consistent messaging will build trust and get most

people to do their part.
