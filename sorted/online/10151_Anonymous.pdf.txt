Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 10151

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 Having been involved in climate change policy since the mid 1990's I can tell you that the time for more consultation is over. We all
 know what needs to happen, just do it.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 All sectors, all gases. No excuses. The economy is a subset of our society, and our society is a subset of the environment. The

 "economy" should not and cannot dictate our survival on this planet. This issue is far more fundamental than our current economic or
 fiscal performance.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes

 Getting to zero will take some doing, and the agriculture sector has a huge challenge. They should therefore be given the
 opportunity to interact with global partners to meet this challenge, and the international trade of carbon units should be allowed for
 this reason.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 No. An Act of Parliament should be required to make any changes. The target needs to be clear, ambitious, and have wide

 parliamentary support if we are to finally take this matter in hand.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Yes. I had the privilege of being part of the core design team of the first NEECS (National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy)

 in 2001, that also had targets set. While we found it difficult to know with any satisfactory level of accuracy what difference our actions
 would take over time, we knew that if we measured what we were doing, we could make improvements to our actions, and to the way
 we measured them. New Zealand has grown that model and now has a comprehensive National Energy Strategy, which has

 stabilised our energy sector, reduced uncertainties, and allowed more focussed management of risks. Providing the Climate Change
 Commission (CCC) an ongoing long term budget as proposed makes a huge difference to what actions are ultimately taken, what

 measurement methods are established, and who gets involved to drive change. The lack of certainty on what "on the ground"
 actions will be taken should not be reason to pause, but even more reason to get stuck in now.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

Notes
Ultimately the Government of today cannot tie the fiscal hands of a government voted in at the next election. While NZ does not yet

have a constitution, this principle is an essential part of democracy, whether, in this case, we like it or not. The necessary challenge
here is to ensure cross party support for the climate change budget.



Clause

7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
See above.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
I think it is worth including reference to the co-benefits of climate change action in CCC's considerations. For example planting large
riparian strips of native forest along riverbeds and creating carbon forests can also improve water quality, reduce erosion etc.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes

Yes. While it may be politically unpalatable to have policy driven plans that could prove unsuccessful, and therefore provide
ammunition for the opposition, it is absolutely essential that plans be set, and we grasp that nettle, as we did when constructing the

first NEECS. We need to move to learning by doing, not learning by talking about it. It mat be worth considering providing scope for
CCC to assist in the establishment of plans, as MfE is not well placed to develop plans of a more operational nature (which is where

EECA have historically been very adept).



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

While households emit, NZ businesses are the largest emitters, and businesses will ultimately be the ones to make the changes
needed to reach the target. They have had many many years of engagement on climate change policy (I sat as Vector's

representative on the technical advisory group to Government climate change policy in the early 2000's, and it was entirely made up
of large corporate interests). The Climate Change Commission should obviously work with business, but understand its role as a
Climate Change regulator, similar to that of the Commerce Commission. The methods used by the Commerce Commission in the

regulation of monopoly businesses such as electricity and gas networks would be a useful model to examine for the Climate Change
Commission, as ultimately they need to make decisions that businesses will not like, and that will result in wasteful legal

consequences. Reducing that waste through borrowing from Commerce Commission practices would, in my view, be useful.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes but the Commission also needs to be able to effect change through regulation of businesses, and enforcement of those
regulations. Otherwise we have not taken any meaningful steps forward.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Notes
The CCC does not need to be directly involved in the ETS, in terms of management or governance. The CCC should be involved in

establishment of criteria for categories of trading units, for example how many NZU's does a hectare of native forest, or plantation
pine generate over time. While these have been set at a high level by Kyoto and Paris Agreements, NZ should have the discretion to

adjust those Units or criteria to meet a wider set of policies such as to improve water quality, reduce erosion etc.
Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes this seems like a satisfactory list.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes absolutely. I cannot think why you would not.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

While this is an individual submission, I have five young children who support this submission, to the extent they understand what the
issues are and what I have submitted here. It is for them (and their potential children) I write this as they will bear the brunt of our

inaction.
