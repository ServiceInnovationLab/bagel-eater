Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Reference no: 11643

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 The Government should accept that 'Climate Change' is a massive con to extort mega money from gullible nations and people. We
 have been given alarmist statistics for years now, initially as global cooling, which when that didn't pan out, became global warming,

 then morphed into anthropogenic climate change when that became inconvenient. Climate, is and always will be cyclical, change is
 part of the natural process/



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes
 The Governmant should sit back and watch the trees and grass grow while converting that nasty CO2 into oxygen in the process




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 NZ should sit back and let the major polluters sort out their own houses first. Even a mammoth effort from NZ won't make a blind bit
 of difference if these nations aren't on board.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Notes
 With zero carbon, and our dairy industry in ruins, what does the Government think the plant based agriculture they are pushing is

 going use to grow.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 The whole thing is unnecessary, a con on an unprecedented scale. The money could be better spent on essential infrastructure.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes

 Yes, if we ever get a Government that is able to see through this self-serving global con, they should be free to abandon the whole
 thing immediately, not have to wait ten or fifteen years.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes

 Any Government should have the right to state it is a load of rubbish and walk away from the whole ting and allocate the money to
 things that will actually benefit New Zealanders



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
 Notes
 No, it has been prepared by vested interests, bent on keeping their cosy salaries. To admit the evidence doesn't stack up, would be

 a loss of face they will not accept and will keep on with their agendas
Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
No
Notes

Completely unnecessary if we every are fortunate to get a Government that is prepared to stand up to the International bullies and
tell them we are pulling out and ceasing our funding immediately.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The Government really needs to consider what NZ is doing without because of the funds that are being squandered - our health,

education, roading, etc are all suffering because of the diversion of this money to this global scam.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

The Government should disband the whoe thing and spend the money elsewhere where it is really neccessary.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes

Being on The Climate Change Commission is nice work if you can con your way into it. How these people sleep at night, when they
are so completely unobjective and open to suggestion and warm fuzzies being 'important' on the international stage defeats me.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
The sort of expertise that the sort of people who should be appointed as Climate Change Commissioners will never be recognised by

this Government, who are completely brainwashed as to what appropriate qualifications are. There is no room for anyone who won't
tow the correct line.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes

It's a complete load of bollocks - we are condemning future generations to the misery that the diversion of the money being
squandered on this pseudo-science will bring to them, infrastructure that is not being built, health and education underspends. It's
so sad.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes
Honestly, people need to put on another cardi or take one off to adapt. I am 63 and in my time I have witnessed the cyclical nature

and listened to younger alarmists thinking it is all new. The sky is not falling!!



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes
No. But in this day and age, what's another committee and a bunch of salaries. At least their children will get fed and have shoes to

wear to school.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
I wish we had politicians who would put New Zealand first, and have the honesty not to spend out hard-earned money on the sort of

dubious global schemes that make them feel good and have their five minutes at some conference stage somewhere in the world,
that they have used lord only knows how many carbon units to get to. New Zealand and our own needs should be first and foremost.

I despair at the squandering of the hundreds of millions of dollars that really could make a difference for us.
