Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Deborah Wilson, Deborah Jane Wilson









Reference no: 11485

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes
 The Government should set a flexible target based on the best science now (i.e. Zero Net Carbon by 2050) but that target can be

 made more stringent if new science or events dictate but not less stringent.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 Domestic should include embodied carbon, both the aviation and shipping industries and the future of the tourism industry. This
 should not preclude assistance for developing nations in achieving their emissions goals. Planting native forests should take
 precedence over short term plantation forests for achieving net anthropogenic emissions objectives.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Only if a more stringent limit or shorter timeframe is identified as necessary by the Climate Commission and receives Parliamentary

 approval.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 No, the third budget should only be revised in exceptional circumstances on the recommendation of the Climate Commission and
 with the approval of Parliament but not at the whim of an incoming government.




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Only on the recommendation of the Climate Commission and with the approval of Parliament, but not at the whim of an incoming
government.




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes
I recommend adding four new objectives, altering one and setting an order of priority as shown: i) (New) the need to preserve healthy

ecosystem function for life supporting capacity, biodiversity and to provide ecosystem services. ii) (New) the need for NZ to play its
genuine and just part in the international effort to stabilise the climate and to maximise the probability of successfully complying with

the target limit for the wellbeing of future generations iii) (New) the need for precaution, given the level of uncertainty attached to
estimates affecting the rate of GHG emissions and climate change iv) (New) the likelihood and the potential impact on climate change
of any scarcity of material resources on the economy and GHG emissions, particularly that of fossil energy v) the three Government

objectives for climate change policy: sustainable economy, global and local leadership and creating a just and inclusive society vi) the
Government’s obligations under the Treaty of Waitangi vii) social circumstances and, in particular, the likely impact of the decision on

fuel poverty viii) (altered) scientific knowledge about climate change and its limitations ix) technology relevant to climate change x)
energy policy and, in particular, the likely impact of the decision on energy supplies and the carbon and energy intensity of the

economy xi) fiscal circumstances and, in particular, the likely impact of the decision on taxation, public spending and public borrowing
xii) economic circumstances and, in particular, the likely impact of the decision on the economy and the competitiveness of particular

sectors of the economy.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

1. a highly precautionary budget that makes highest rates of emissions decline in the first years and does not rely on overly complex
technology or technical breakthroughs to achieve it 2. clear process and timelines 3. Consider uncertainty in our present knowledge

of climate change,



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
I also suggest the following additional types of expertise: Values and ethics Climate modelling Environmental economics Transition

engineering Energy Public Health and communication



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes
It should focus primarily on mitigation, but must also include adaptation.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
I support preparation of a national climate risk assessment, a national policy plan to address those risks identified, and a monitoring

and reporting framework



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

I recommend that the Climate Change Commission's purpose and aims also include concepts of : - improving the overall well-being of
all New Zealanders - having regard to a wide range of communities of interest and population groups in New Zealand society - the

need to live within the material and energy limits of Earth’s environmental systems essential for human and other life, and - the need
to integrate climate transition, adaptation and mitigation requirements with responses to other risks we face
