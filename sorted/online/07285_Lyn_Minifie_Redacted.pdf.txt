Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Lyn Minifie









Reference no: 7285

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes
 We need ambitious action now



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 Because agriculture contributes 50% of emissions and ethane is a significant player, we can't ignore this and need to research our

 response urgently



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 Preferably but which ever option gives the best global result in reduction of emissions, as the problem is global and we are not in a
 protected bubble in NZ.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 It shouldn't be weakened. A change in government must not allow reversal of initiatives that will take time to show benefit- long term

 fixes dont always show immediate results



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes

 Difficult to predict the issues for 5 years ,so some flexibility in prioritising is needed, as long as weakening the targets are not the
 intention



 Clause

 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
Investment in low carbon transport infrastructure Reduction in waste generation eg packaging, particularly non reusable packaging

Subsidisation of glass and soft plastic recycling businesses Incentives for people who invest in solar power Reworking of local
legislation to encourage smaller homes and higher density




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
The Government needs to be accountable to an independent body who isn't influenced by 3 yrly elections



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Conflicts of interest must be absolutely absent



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Thank you for the opportunity to have some input. I feel strongly about global warming and that NZ can only benefit from taking a lead

globally in emission reduction. Short term costs will give long term advantage in to the future. I am a Nurse and am dismayed at the
short term view , and token gestures that hospitals take towards waste reduction. An example of this immoral approach to global

resources : single use stainless steel scissors and forceps which are imported from third world ? India, used once, then discarded. In
the past hospitals have had larger sterilisation services and good quality scissors etc have been autoclaved and reused. The
economics of this situation is immoral and happens in many areas of business- and points to reasons why we are in our current

environmental predicament
