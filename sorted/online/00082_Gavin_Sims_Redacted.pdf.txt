 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 Not sufficient funds available




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Without this ability nothing can be changed

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
