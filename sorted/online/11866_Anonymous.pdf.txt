Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill







Reference no: 11866

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 Waiting for the commission will take too long I fear, even though they may have good advice. It is best that deadlines are set now and

 we are then under pressure to reach them rather than forever delaying until we find the 'perfect' solution everyone agrees on. This
 should never mean of course, that corners are cut or that marginalised sectors of society are made to carry the weight.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 The so-called 'short-lived' gases have a far greater effect despite being shorter-lived, especially given we are looking at a short time-
 frame to be able to turn back runaway climate chaos. Fugitive gas is particularly bad because we are wasting a really precious

 resource. Nitrous oxide from methane-based urea is poisoning and polluting soils, waterways and reefs which are crucial for
 sustainable economies and carbon capture. So reducing these products would have multiple benefits.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 One of the failures of the ETS was allowing international carbon markets that achieved very little other than driving the carbon price

 down and aiding corrupt business. If we focus on domestics markets it will be much more sustainable and increase a local carbon
 economy that creates much needed jobs, especially in rural areas.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 But only if to make it sooner rather than later. We need to expect that there will be many emergencies in the near future because of
 climate change and demands on global resources and therefore plan emergencies into the strategy not use them as excuses to exit

 the strategy.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes
 Again this should only be to make it better not worse as in speed up the process not slow it down



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

As said previously, there are enough predictions already about the increasing number of emergencies we will face. This needs to be
worked into strategies at the beginning



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
But there is too much focus on business and fuel supply. There needs to be a really strong focus on sustainable economies as in
local, decentralised infrastructure for transport, trade, education, health, recreation. There needs to be an understanding of

ecological sustainability for new or old technologies such as regenerative agriculture, rongoā, biological farming, freshwater
indigenous fisheries and textile industries... Access for support must be fair




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes

Of course or how else will we achieve these goals.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Those most affected must have more say, especially the young, the poor, women and tāngata whenua. They should also have more
input into solutions as typically their solutions are more economically and socially sustainable since they focus on need, using what

they have be it low or no budgets or humble experts with generations of local knowledge. It would be wrong and stupid to look for
solutions from the same capitalist models and fossil fuel industries who got us into this mess.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
However I don't see why we should be using international emissions reductions to fulfill our targets. This should be removed from the

list.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

I would prefer experts over politicians but it depends of course on what experts on what subjects and under what process eg. does
the chair get veto rights? And who chooses the experts? Whoever is chosen needs to be unconflicted by financial, political or social
prejudice.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
I would add knowledge of sustainable development techniques and planning in particular energy, agriculture, housing, trade and

transport



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes
But this should not override the focus of preventing climate change. Some adaption is needed urgently such as plant resilience and

reducing flood and drought effects.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
It would be good to see this extended to the private sector as well such as large industries like Fonterra and power companies that, if

they topple, will have major effects on our people



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
I am happy to see a bill like this finally being drafted and I really hope it comes out strong. It would be foolhardy if decision-makers on

this bill were swayed by the interests of the rich and powerful. We have looked after the interests of a few over the interests of the
99% for far too long. Please do the right thing.
