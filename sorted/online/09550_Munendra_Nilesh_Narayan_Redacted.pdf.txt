Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Sam, Munendra Nilesh Narayan









Reference no: 9550

Submitter Type:

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes

 Net Zero emission is not achievable, for starters ban smoking instead of legalizing weed.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 Carbon dioxide is essential to our environment, some of us needs to go back to school to learn the basics of how nature works
 before destroying our earth in the name of good.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes

 New Zealand meeting it's target won't put a ding to what New Zealand thinks is global warming. We are just a drop in the ocean.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 There are more severe matters that needs addressing and better ways to use the limited finance in hand.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes

 The public should be able to decide on how to address these matters, the government is just the care takers of this country.



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

 Position
No

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

This government needs to work out the basics of economy, as they seem to underestimate the cost of everything and then squeeze
it out of the forgotten middle class families.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
Why does the Minister of Environment and the Minister of Climate Change have such big pay packages when they need a separate

commission to advise them on these matters. If it were any other job they would be fired for not doing their jobs.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes

They should not exist to begin with, unless the Government Ministers come down to a realistic packages then only we can afford
these commissions.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

We are moving from duel to electric vehicles but how are we gonna deal with these batteries when they come to the end of life.
MOST IMPORTANTLY our mobile network is growing at a very fast pace and this is emitting a huge amount of radiation which causes

cancer and I think that should be a top priority.
