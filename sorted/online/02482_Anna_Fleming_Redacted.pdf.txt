Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Anna Fleming









Reference no: 2482

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes
 I believe that climate change is a very real issue and a 2050 target gives us a good change to help us approach these negative

 impacts.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 I believe that all gases should be inclusive in this target as they all have an impact on climate change



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 This allows us to have firmer budgets in the beginning with some room to be flexible toward the end of the 15 year cycle



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 This feels too risky depending on the government of the day



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
 Again it feels too risky depending on the government of the day
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

I was pleased to see the inclusion of scientific, evidence based considerations ALONGSIDE indigenous and social considerations.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
Agree for accountability



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
- the effect on low income earners - impact on Pacific nations, as a Pacific nation ourselves - Tikanga Maori considerations




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes

I do not agree with the NZ ETS and am not sure how this will look in terms of independence



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
I think having a national plan will ensure that local government also adhere to climate change policy and take on useful guidance




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
