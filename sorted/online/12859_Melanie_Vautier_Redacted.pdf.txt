Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Reference no: 12859

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 We have put dealing with this off for decades and now already we are facing consequences. NZ has currently very weak regulation in
 regards to environmental / climate protection and the Zero Carbon Act can provide a framework to begin to remedy this. The

 importance of this cannot be understated: it is an existential threat. The ways we can change our society to mitigate and adapt to
 climate change has the potential to create dozens of co-benefits and create a better, more equal, more connected society. Climate
 change is a feedback process from the atmosphere that we are out of kilter with the planet- we need to adjust our ways. The Zero

 Carbon Act is an important step towards this.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 We need to set a confirmed target by the end of the year of net zero for 2050 at the very least. Even that is unlikely to meet any 1.5
 degree cut off points so we should be aiming for net zero by 2040 or net negative by 2050. Tackling methane will be tricky and need

 to be gradually and carefully managed, but if it can get to zero we can start thinking about being net negative as a country which
 would obviously be ideal. If we go for the two basket approach it is vital to have an ambitious, low target to stabilize methane at- e.g.
 5% reduction will be pretty useless. The Climate Commission can look into optimal targets but we should err on the side of caution -

 this does not mean protecting agriculture, it means in terms of the massive risks if we give methane too much leniency. We need to
 have fast and dramatic action so that a lot of the decarbonisation happens earlier on, as it is the cumulative emissions that matter. We
 also need a holistic view, more so than ‘baskets’. We should aim to stay within all planetary boundaries, not just climate change- we

 also need to address nitrogen and phosphorus cycles, biodiversity etc.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 International carbon credits have been completely ineffective and also are unnecessary- we have every capability to do this without
 them (indeed if we can't, who can?) We also need to set an ambitious gross emissions reduction target- we can't rely on planting

 trees; though this is important at the end of the day we also need to decarbonize our transport and electricty systems. In terms of
 forestry offsets- we should also open up talks about credits for soil carbon sequestration. This could be a game changer for
 agriculture- if we are looking to lead the world in sustainable agriculture it is vital to have good soil, and good soil is full of carbon. If

 farmers have financial incentives to have healthy soil that will lessen the use of fertilizers and encourage more organic-based farming.
 We could also look at offsets in wetlands, mangroves, hemp - all of which sequester more than trees.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 No

 Notes



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

Notes



Clause

7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should take the following factors into consideration when advising on and

setting budgets: moral responsibility to act • scientific knowledge regarding climate change • technology relevant to climate change
• economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of

the economy (in terms of economic impacts from delaying action) and also realising economics is not all encompassing nor
necessarily always an appropriate tool, considering the massive risks to life and civilisation. • social circumstances and the likely
impact of a decision on fuel poverty (and awareness of international studies which show successful management of removals of fuel

subsidies when fuel poverty is countered with something like a cash transfer) • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on
energy supplies and the carbon and energy intensity of the economy. benefits of resilience be being more self sufficient in terms of

energy



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes, but it still emphasises economics over climate science. Unless economists start taking a more ecological viewpoint and
considering externalities and the economy as part of a wider system, rather than all-encompassing, this could be dangerous in

perpetuating current damaging institutions. It is important to have diverse experts in fields such as climate science and policy
communication as well as economists. For example, previous governments have purposefully only looked at the cost of taking action,
when they should also have looked at the costs of the impacts of climate change.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Creating a strong Zero Carbon Act requires bravery and political confidence- with the changes we need, feathers will be ruffled and

many will complain. However, the necessity to go through with this with 100% commitment is so absolutely huge that it must
outweigh all else. We have the potential, the capacity and the obligation to create a better future. You who have the power to create

this Act, we are counting on you. Please, have the courage to make this work !
