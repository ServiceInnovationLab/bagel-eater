Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

          Ronald Ivan Elder









Reference no: 10998

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes
 Action is urgently needed because the previous government tinkered with a seruious problem.. This government was elected on a

 platform of addressing climate change - the government should set as challenging and aspirational a target as possible.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 The climate change problem is pressingly urgent. Part-measures have been tried before. This is the time to grasp the nettle and take
 radical action.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 The ETS is demonstrably a failed mechanism open to manipulation and downright fraud. Offsetting emissions does not reduce the

 emissions. There must be an absolute reducion in carbon emissions.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes

 The target should be set at a challenging level and policy settings should then ensure that the target is met. The target should be
 legally binding on successive governments.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 I agree it makes sense to have a progressive planned approach to meeting the end goal of carbon-zero economy.




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes

 Emissions budgets should be changed only in order to make them even more stringent and radical. There should be an independent
 review of any such changes in order to detect 'bullshit' or fudging.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

BUT ... the ability to make changes to the emissions budgets should be very restrictive and limited within a very small range.



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

The Government should prioritise investment in research into emissions-reducing technologies, either by direct grant or by tax
incentives. New Zealand should aim to become a world-leader and exporter of such technologies.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

A clear programme should be provided by the Government to give guidance and certainty to private enterprise in their business
planning.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The Government should draw upon the expertise of NGOs which have been campaigning on the issue of climate change for decades
- such as the Environmental Defence Society and Greenpeace; Academics in the climate field, progressive economists.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
I(t's main function should be bullshit and crap detection. It should have powersd to set aside foot-dragging by industry resistant to

change.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

The ETS should not be subject to political influence. The Climate Commission should have control of ETS policy settings. Successive
governments should not be able to overrule the Commission.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Care must be taken to ensure that appointees to the Commission are committed to radical action on Climate Change.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

The Bill should include mechanisms for coordinating local responses to Climte Change



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
We should implement such a reporting power as soon as possible



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

The need to address Climate Change is extreeme and demands urgent attention by the Government. The Government must take a
visionary lead on this issue, if necessary taking action well in advance of general public support levels. There are times when

governments should lead the people and this is one of them.
