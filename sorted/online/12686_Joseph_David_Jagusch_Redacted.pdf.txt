Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Joseph David Jagusch




Reference no: 12686

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes




 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 Yes if ahead of the desired 2050 outcome (on for the 15 years) and a stronger position is being set to be achieved than expected.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
 Notes
 proper and effective collaboration will insure appropriate negotiations are made early on




 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes
Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

If hours of work for individuals change and expectations on income change, how will banks view mortgage repayments and what will
the expectations be that the workforce operate from office evirons as opposed to being mobile. Does this have an affect on use of

existing infrastructure and dependencies we have developed? Emissions are a centralised and an industrial production problem. I get
the impression that as performance of businesses/industry adapts to only needing to report on adverse effects found out by their

autonomous monitoring (as opposed to stipulated data detail) the responsibility shift has the potential to change/reduce regulatory
resourcing needs.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
Depend on who the climate change commission is paid by and whether they are seen as impartial and/or representing all parties to

be affected. Are they an independent group or a govt agency?



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes
if the climate change commission is subject to disincentive to see the outcome to its 2050 goal or one which is even quicker, and

there is no vision for reversing the carbon loss and that being an ongoing role, the advise may stand to resist NZ achieving full
potential




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
I want to see new blood get involved. We can't afford to have old heads dominating the dialogue. Creativity is important




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

This is a connected function which may or may not need to move at the same pace. Its part of a culture shift and losing the
attachment to typical urban construct/spread.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
In my view local authority infrastructure expansion with respect to underground and overhead services should come to an end. Local

sourcing and new construction needs to be completely raised to the fore in the vein of Regen villages which are being built in Europe
and earmarked for North Africa. an urban-rural continuum which does not waste water by producing blackwater - creating un-
necessary risk. The culture around human poo has to make a big shift.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
