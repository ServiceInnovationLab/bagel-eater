Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Andrew Faith, Andrew Faith









Reference no: 12935

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes

 Set a target that won't cripple the country and turn us into Venezuela



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes
 If the atmospheric concentration of methane is not increased there will be no warming



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 The Paris agreement has no binding targets so why destroy NZs economy trying to meet them



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Man made global warming will be seen to be a massive fraud on mankind



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 When it is found that manmade global warming is a fraud, we must have the option to get out of a budget



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes

 Should be able to review the 1st budget. Where is that question?



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
Once climate fraud is discovered we will need to get out of it




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
No

Notes

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

exposure to climate change risks?

Position
No
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
The science on climate change is not settled. Against all dire predictions the oceans have only risen 1mm since the industrial

revolution. The manmade global warming fraud must stop before this government destroys New Zealand
