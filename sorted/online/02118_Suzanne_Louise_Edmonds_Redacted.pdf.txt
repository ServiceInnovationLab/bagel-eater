Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Freelance farming & science writer (Suzanne Louise (Sue) Edmonds)









Reference no: 2118

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes

 Whatever goal is set it has to be able to survive changes of government over the next 32 years, and it had better be started fast.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes
 It isn't just cows making methane, but rubbish dumps etc. At least if we stabilise these we might actually achieve our goal.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 Our reputation collapsed over the last lot of cheating with worthless bought emissions reductions.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 Climate change may well get quicker, but leaving a door open for changing the target would be daft. If we reach it earlier, then hooray!



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes
 There probably has to be some flexibility, but no escape clauses!




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No
 Notes

 No escape clauses! The naysayers would have a field day.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
However, I would also recommend that the Commission take a broad view and include factors where Nature could assist, rather than

more chemicals, and technology isn't the answer to everything!



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
We need the plans written up large if we are to achieve anything.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
In trying to reduce agricultural emissions they should stop believing everything that the big fertiliser companies claim, and look more

widely at more natural products and systems. One of these has already been brought to the notice of Ministers (Functional Fertiliser).
Chemicals and vaccines won't achieve it, or give us cleaner water.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
But its advisory role must be able to hold Government to account, as in the second option of Table 6.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes
See my answer to question 11.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

Need to also include knowledge of the private innovation system, to provide a wider view than what seems to pertain at present.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes
Otherwise it would be a waste of time if we (individuals and businesses) don't have guidance on what to do.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
As long as those involved in the various tasks actually work together, on all issues.
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

The more sharing, the better.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Please note my answer to question 10. At present a lot (most) of the funding for agricultural mitigation and adaptation is coming from

the two big fertiliser companies, whose profit is being made from selling products which are ruining our soils, growing less pasture
than in the 1980s, and leaching hugely into our waters. Until someone is prepared to think outside this system, and fund testing for

what may well be natural alternatives, progress in agriculture will be painfully slow.
