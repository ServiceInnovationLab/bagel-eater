Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Reference no: 9791

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes




 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases
 Notes

 The draft Productivity Commission report indicates that long term the earlier we achieve net zero emissions the better, but given NZ's
 current reliance on the dairy industry it makes sense to give a few years leeway for short-lived gases. At the same time, NZ Govt must

 heavily incentivise the development of technologies to enable short-lived gases to be reduced (with a view to either developing a
 replacement industry for NZ to excel in or allowing the dairy industry to become carbon efficient).



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes
 A functional itnl emissions trading scheme makes sense for the same reason the globalised economy makes sense - it allows

 industries to be centred in parts of the world that can undertake them efficiently. For example, NZ is an efficient grass-fed dairy
 producer. It doesn't make sense to shift dairy production overseas to countries that do it less efficiently (e.g. in South America or

 Europe). Therefore it makes sense to incentivise the production of dairy in NZ. Would be helpful if NZ could buy carbon credits off
 other countries that dont need them (e.g. countries that are more tertiary industry heavy) and continue producing dairy as efficiently
 as possible (if not carbon neutrally).



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 It's too tempting. Subsequent govts may well believe that their situation is unique (e.g. if there's another global economic crisis or

 whatever) but in reality climate change is the biggest economic and social threat to NZ longterm and we can't keep borrowing
 time/resources off our future selves.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
Delete the fuel poverty reference as it is not sufficiently applicable in NZ to warrant specific mention. In the UK their electricity is

generated predominantly by non-renewables so the price of electricity is linked to the availability of coal etc. In NZ any electric heating
devices are powered by approx. 75% renewables (as we have so much hydropower).



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
1) Be realistic 2) Someone needs to be accountable for a failure to comply with the plan



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

Don't want the NZ ETS approach too heavily influenced by vote-grabbing.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

Yes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
But not opposed to separate legislation covering that issue.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Regulation is great but arguably there has been under-consideration of the power of the market to get NZ firms to embrace carbon-
efficiency. The govt is a big procurer of goods and services and has lots of market power but there doesnt seem to be any all-of-

government strategy to incentivising carbon efficiency. I work in the construction industry and I'm thinking specifically of how the UK
govt made it a requirement of contractors to have certain Building Information Modelling level capabilities before said contractor was
eligible for govt projects - this resulting in much higher BIM uptake in the UK construction industry than elsewhere. It may be possible

to use the same technique to encourage low-carbon technology uptake in NZ both in the construction and other industries. It needs
to be worth private enterprises' while to invest in carbon-lowering technologies - one way to do this is to create a market for it. That

will lower the cost of those technologies and eventually private procurers will also be able to afford the benefits.
