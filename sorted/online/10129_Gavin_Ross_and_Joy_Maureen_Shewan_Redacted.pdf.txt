Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Gavin Shewan, Gavin Ross and Joy Maureen Shewan









Reference no: 10129

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes

 New Zealand is one of the cleanest countries in the world. Agriculture was put into our ETS when no other country in the world has
 done it. The political reason for this is outlined at the end of the submission.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Notes
 Methane from agriculure is already at net zero. It is a circular process and scientific studies have verified this. Grass also captures

 carbon.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Notes
 See Answer number 1



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 New Zealand should not be governed by a non elected body of bureaucrats. That is communism. See notes at end of submission.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
No
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
The basis of the New Zealand economy.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Notes
As Question number 4.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
As Question number 4



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Animals raised by grass fed systems can be a net carbon sink. This is the finding of a new study by scientists from Michigan State
University that was published in the Agricultural Systems journal. After evaluating adaptive multi-paddock (AMP) grass-fed operations

and grain-fed, feedlot ones, they concluded that AMP grazing has the potential to offset greenhouse gas emissions, while the end
phase of beef production can actually be a net carbon sink. They reached their conclusion by reviewing past studies and carrying out
new research over the course of four years at their Lake Station AgBioResearch Center using herds of more than 200 steers. They

looked at statistics from the finishing phase, including daily weight gain and carcass weight, and compared it to the carbon dioxide,
methane and nitrous oxide from fermentation and digestion, feed production, farm energy use and manure storage. They also
assessed the carbon losses that arose from soil erosion. I do not like industrialised farming but our beef and sheep farms are virtually

all run on grass fed systems and many of our dairy farms. The worst offenders are Corporate dairy units owned by businessmen
rather than farmers. The idealogy of Climate change is to change the economic structure of the world. United Nations (U.N.) official

Christina Figueres recently made a stunning statement at a Brussels news conference, admitting that global warming is a hoax.
Figueres, the executive secretary of the U.N.’s Framework Convention on Climate Change, carefully worded her admission. The

takeaway is that climate activists aren’t actually trying to save the planet, they’re trying to kill capitalism. Figueres initially stated: “This
is the first time in the history of mankind that we are setting ourselves the task of intentionally, within a defined period of time, to
change the economic development model that has been reigning for at least 150 years, since the Industrial Revolution.” Figueres

reiterates, “This is probably the most difficult task we have ever given ourselves, which is to intentionally transform the economic
development model for the first time in human history.” Reported February 2017
