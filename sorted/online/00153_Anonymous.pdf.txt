Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill







Reference no: 153

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes

 It is important to set a well-informed target as soon as possible, as informed by climate experts.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 Ideally, net zero emissions. The best target is the most potentially impactful and influential goal that we could set. It is ambitious, so
 we should also consider social and economic implications, and assist vulnerable communities and high-emissions organisations to
 adapt, while investing in new sector opportunities for sustainable innovation and employment. (Just realized this is included in page

 39. I agree with page 39.)



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes
 Mainly using domestic emissions reductions would help ensure that strong, long-term measures are being taken to reduce

 emissions in New Zealand. Considering that net zero is an ambitious goal, carbon credits (sourced according to a robust criteria as
 on page 33) could be a minor supplement.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 If circumstances change, the Bill should only be able to be revised under exceptional circumstances. The Zero Carbon Bill needs to
 be substantial and not easily changed to the point where it doesn't hold .




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
Notes




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes
It will be important to specify a timeline and update on progress made.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
Agriculture (sustainable agriculture), ensuring that the dairy industry is reducing emissions.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
The Government should publicly respond to deviations from the Commission's advice, with rationale.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
Notes

Mandatory for Crown entities, local and central government, and some major public services. This means there is a range of reports
that would result in well-informed decision making. The reports should cover the risks identified, measures taken and any problems

(including problems that the government could assist with), progress since the last report, and measures that the organisation is
considering.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

(In support of page 39) The government should implement policy that would assist vulnerable communities to adapt, since many of
them will be more adversely affected. Businesses that generate high emissions should innovate and develop in an agile way.

Ultimately, to succeed, stakeholders in all of society will need to do their part. It will be important for the Bill to start with well-informed
and meaningful policies.
