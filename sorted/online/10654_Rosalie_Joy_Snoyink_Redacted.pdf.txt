Rosalie Joy Snoyink








Reference no: 10654

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 Reducing emissions is urgent. I would like to see a new date set for net zero carbon emissions at 2040.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 Emissions from agriculture, industry, transport and all other sources should be included.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 The Bill should require Governments to set out how they will achieve the emissions budget, including transition pathways



 Clause

 11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
 its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 The Commission should monitor emissions and advise New Zealanders on how to keep on track for its emissions reduction targets.



 Clause
 13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
 Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
Yes

Notes
The Climate Change Commissions should advise the government on targets and policy planning. The Commission should also act as

an independent watchdog, publishing progress reports and highlighting problems.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
The government should set a National Adaption Plan that sets clear direction to local government and helps co-ordinate the

response across different sectors and including iwi and hapu.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Climate Change is the most important issue of our time. It should be beyond politics and all political parties should work together to

achieve meaningful action. I support the Zero Carbon Bill in general but wish to see a new target date for zero emissions of 2040. I
support the submissions of the following groups: Forest and Bird, EDS, Greenpeace, Young Greens and Generation Zero.
