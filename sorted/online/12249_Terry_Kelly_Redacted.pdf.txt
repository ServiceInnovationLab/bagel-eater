Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Terry Kelly








Reference no: 12249

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 I strongly support the immediate introduction of zero-carbon legislation. I would prefer a target date sooner than 2050.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived

 gases
 Notes
 I support the two basket approach for short and long-lived gases, but only if methane is first cut deeply and fast, to a level supported

 by science, and if fossil methane is put in the same basket as the other fossil fuels. Short-lived gases must be reduced to sustainable
 levels.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 Allowing international carbon credits to be counted as domestic emission reduction (as has been going on thus far) has been

 completely ineffective, and we have every capability of reaching these goals without them.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes

 The 2050 target should not be altered in response to “economic changes” as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the
 ability to revise the 2050 target in light of major changes in scientific understanding or international agreements should be permitted.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Yes - I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance, so that 3 are in effect at all times.




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 No - emissions budgets should not be altered in response to “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty.
 However, the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in scientific understanding or international agreements should be
 permitted.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
See note above in Q6



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be comprehensive, fair and cost-effective, environmentally

sustainable, and reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

The Commission should not be a decision-making body. However, the Government should be legally required to consider and
formally respond to the Commission’s advice, and to provide an explanation if they do not act on it.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to
the number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
I also think expertise in public health is important.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

Should also include helping our Pasifika neighbours adapt to climate change; may require a separate adaptation sub-committee
within the Climate Commission.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
