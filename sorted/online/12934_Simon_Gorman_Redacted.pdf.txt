Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

       Simon Gorman








Reference no: 12934

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes
 The government should set a goal & the Climate Change Commission advises on the specific target later



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 Targeting net zero by 2050 - anything less is self mutilation!




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 Domestic emissions only, as the whole world will be scrambling for access to International Units.....




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Yes, probability that target revision needed in response to observe change, thus including option for increased stringency of

 emission control. A



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Yes, a sound inbuilt flexibility is essential!



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes
 Change in third emission budget only when subsequent budget is set up.




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Under independently assessed exceptional circumstances, yes, as in event of major natural seismic event....
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Yes indeed




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

Categorically, yes!



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Certainly, for central government to work harmoniously and productively with provincial / local government, with the science and
technology community, the productive sectors - we all have flesh in the game, ideas and endeavour to contribute! Synergy rules!




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Categorically yes, the CCC is the appropriate body to advise and monitor, to keep us honest to our targets!



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes
This removes ETS management from the volatility of the political arena



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Indeed yes, with a focus on science & technology, not to be hijacked by covert business agendas that may undermine the central,
singular goal.... All parties involved must unequivocally bring a full conviction to effective climate management. Whilst Maori tikanga

has value, ours must be a multi cultural endeavour, particularly as Pacifica have most to lose in the short run.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes
Categorically yes, adaption is survival, there is miniscule chance of smooth passage through our near future!




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Yes! Acknowledging the piecemeal profile of adaption and uplift by provincial / local government and of the business and productive
sectors, a singular, coherent hand on the tiller is vital.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes

Notes
Yes, the government should set up targeted adaption recording, keep the means of recording user friendly and involve broad

spectrum input. Such engagement often brings growing involvement and commitment, if sympathetically managed!



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
This is likely to be the singularly most important venture we will embark upon. The presentation you offer that I respond to now

validates the seriousness of our endeavour. Make us proud of you, we will return the favour! Kia kaha
