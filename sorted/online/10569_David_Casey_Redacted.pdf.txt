 Clause
 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

 Fonterra needs legislative pressure to transition away from dairy. We need to impose a leadership role on them, not a defensive

 position such as they took in response to the mild anti dairy implications of A2.

 its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position

Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
One issue on which I no longer align with the party is light rail Vs road-vased mass transit - in recent years I've revised my stance to

favour self-drive electric infrastructure over rail. New Zealand's geography and lack of density, combined with the benefit of utilising
existing infrastructure makes it extremely viable, and it is an area where global leadership is required.
