Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Mrs (Melissa Moore)









Reference no: 9620

Submitter Type:

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes
 Our target should be ambitious in order to safeguard Aotearoa for future generations. It needs to be zero emissions and it needs to

 be set in law, protected from government change/from term to term. Anything less is a failure to act.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 I believe the target should actually be more ambitious than this in terms of time: 2040. Other countries are leading the way, many with
 equally small populations. If we invest in our future and green economies, jobs will flow from those and our country will be stronger

 and healthier.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 But only to reduce the amount of time allowed to take this. A get out clause has the potential for future governments to neglect their

 duty and let Aotearoa 'tread water' while all the time the waters are rising and we're drowning, not waving.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 However, I believe this period should be extended to cover the whole of the period to the target of 2050.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 However, the budget should be able to be increased by governments who want to further progress or as technology allows through

 new developments. The budget should never be allowed to be decreased. There should also be a minimum amount set in the
 budget so governments cannot aim for the lowest possible allocation.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

However, the budget should be able to be increased by governments who want to further progress or as technology allows through
new developments. The budget should never be allowed to be decreased. There should also be a minimum amount set in the

budget so governments cannot aim for the lowest possible allocation.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Ensuring that our government works with treaty partners and iwi, local communities, partner with green businesses and green
industries. Making sure all industry is incentivised to adapt sustainable practices. Our zero carbon bill needs to be linked to and

balanced with every aspect of our lives .



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
