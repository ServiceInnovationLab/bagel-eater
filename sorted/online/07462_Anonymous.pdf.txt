Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 7462

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 We should be aiming to reach net zero earlier than 2050.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 I think it is a good idea to have 5 year targets, though we should aim to communicate where we stand in reaching these goals

 beyond an annual report- stats should be readily available year round



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 No, unless the goal is to be more ambitious.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
We need to hold everyone accountable, in order for New Zealand to reduce its collective output of emissions, there should be

allocated allowances across the country. Why have we not structured a framework that requires individuals or companies, institutions
of education etc to record their emission outputs, and place a tax on any over expenditures. We also need to place a huge emphasis

on environmental education. We cannot expect these goals to be met when the definition of sustainability is not yet agreed upon or
even common knowledge, so how are we suppose to work towards such an ambiguous idea.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
These are all post climate change adaptations, yes we should be preparing for future implications of such issues as weather

extremities, though there is no mention of preventative adaptation. We should be acknowledging how we can alter our lifestyles in
order to reduce the future effects of Climate Change.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
We need to seriously consider that the vast majority of short lived gasses are coming from NZ agriculture. The consultation held on

the 4th July in Wellington referenced 'the evolution of technology' a lot and seemed to rely on this as our saviour. Sure, there will be
cleaner alternatives that can replace the comforts embedded into our current lifestyles - such as the electric car. This will be huge for
reducing the amount of carbon emission if we are to look at the ecological running cost of cars. It does not however take into

consideration the embodied emissions of a cars production, and how their accessibility (of having extremely low running costs) will
impact the way we use vehicles. It is likely that due to their availability, the amount of cars on the road will increase, along with their

use. So we've got to consider the surrounding infrastructure around alternative technologies and how they may contribute further
unsustainable habits.
