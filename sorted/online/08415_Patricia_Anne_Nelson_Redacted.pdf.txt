Patricia Anne Nelson








Reference no: 8415

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Carbon Dioxide - Reducing net carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2050

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

 Position
 No
 Notes
Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Real science, not the eco science that is touted by the press and IPCC. Also, what the rest of the world is doing. There is no point is
exempting payment from the most populous countries. Spend money earmarked for the Climate Paris Accord on developing a

method to incinerate plastic cleanly, and generating power as a by-product. That is the most pressing problem the world faces.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
The alleged detrimental effect of CO2 has been misunderstood. Over the past 30 years, an area the size of a continent has greened

(just think of the additional oxygen that has been generated from photosynthesis). No account is taken of that for farmers in NZ, who
grow grass to feed their stock. It is a closed cycle as stock emissions are offset by sequestered CO2.
