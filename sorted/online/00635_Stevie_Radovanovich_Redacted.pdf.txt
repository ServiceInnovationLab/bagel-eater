Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

None (Stevie Radovanovich)








Reference no: 635

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 There is no time left to delay change, the environment is drowning and unfortunatley a lot of people/companies/communities will not
 change with out necessities.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 Ideally zero emissions but understand this is a difficult task to tackle. Just anything would be wonderful.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes

 We need to both plant trees (hopefully natives) and implement reduction of emmisions for this to be the most successful. One or the
 other is not good enough and will leave us looking at the same problem still.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 Obviously natural disasters considering. Otherwise no. Its a fair and reasonable and achiaveable target for our 'cleen green' country to

 reach.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Notes
