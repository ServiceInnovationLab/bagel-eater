Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Grace Catley








Reference no: 8081

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 Due to the urgent nature of the issues around climate change we need to be acting now



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 Net zero emissions are needed across all gases because the effect on temperature is from the cumulative effect all of the
 greenhouse gases. Within this parameter short term gases may have to be treated differently than those that are long lived.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes

 As net zero 2050 is ambitious target, initially some of the formula may have to be from ICU.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 This should not be an option due to the urgent nature of the issue



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 A planned approach to carbon reduction is necessary. Budgets will be needed to support initiatives and to get information and

 education out to the wider community. Individualised information and support for various sectors such as business and agriculture will
 be needed.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes



 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes
Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Environmental experts, councils, business groups, the agriculture sector, transport agencies, hospitals, schools, waste stream
management companies and insurance companies.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

This work needs to be authoratative and not watered down by changing politicians.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Expertise relating to the natural environment as a living entity with rights needs to be considered. It can be said that we are in the
position of having to do Zero Carbon work because we have not looked at ourselves as a part of an ecology. A collaborative, holistic
approach to this work is what we need now.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
Coastal environments are under threat, planned withdrawal and adaptation to change are challenges ahead. Sudden intense weather
events are already impacting and communities require support to become resilient around these changes.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
Notes

This will facilitate information sharing between groups with similar issues. Best practice models can be shared to support
organisations on their journey to zero carbon.
