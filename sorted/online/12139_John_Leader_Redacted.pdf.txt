Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

John Leader, PhD, University of Otago (John Leader)









Reference no: 12139

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 By 2050 we shall still be partially reliant on non-renewable resources, not only because of the difficulty of adequately expanding
 electricity generation, but also the disruptive consequences of scaling down or eliminating whole industries. Hence a valiant effort to
 reduce dependence on fossil fuels but with an eye to internal problems and overseas competitors.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes

 Clearly there will be a need to use some emission reductions from overseas.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 I remain sceptical about the consequences and extent of AGW.. The 'prophets of doom' offer an apocalyptic vision of the future, as
 visionaries have through the ages. All of them have been wrong. They start from an uncertain base and extrapolate into the distant

 future. In spite of the claims of impending doom, Change should be gradual and well signalled.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes

 It is obviously sensible to be able to modify targets in the light of events. No government should be tied to such distant decisions.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
For the same reason. An incoming government may well have to act in the face of changing circumstances. We have seen how a

world view has changed in the last few months, and government must be given the freedom to respond



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

It is overarching and ambitious, and largely produced by non-scientists with an unhealthy dose of social context. The considerations
need much more careful analysis and projection, and more informed public debate.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

In a broad sense a 'transparent' government should be quite clear about its plans. What has been produced so far is little better than
a 'chicken little' approach.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Clarity of purpose and transparency. Government will need to remember that purity of purpose may require some hard economic and

social considerations, and changing circumstances may bring soem harsh reality.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

This is self-fulfilling prophecy. Who can say what expertise is desirable? All through this document is the confusion between climate
and weather. A few warm or wet years do not constitute impending disaster. Prudence should be the watchword



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes
What else can it do?




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes
The entire economy of the country could be seriously impacted by moves to include methane in the Zero Emissions Bill.

Consideration of this should be postponed while new solutions are investigated, e.g. selective breeding or development of vaccines.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Festina lente - make haste slowly and deliberately. The hysteria raised by geographers desperate to sup at the trough has been too
strident, and my impression is that the public is largely indifferent. The very much minority 'green component of the government

appears to be punishing its own base by wanting to compel the public ot ride buses and use bicycles. They should be compelled to
live in Dunedin and collect their groceries in a storm
