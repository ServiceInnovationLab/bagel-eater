Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Olivia Wannan




Reference no: 12983

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes




 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 Meeting our ethical obligation to address climate change is well worth the difference in economic growth projected. People will not

 miss the additional economic growth they never had, but they will miss the loss of our coastlines, environment and stability under
 extreme climate change.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes

 Other countries may have access to technologies that NZ will be slower to implement for economic reasons ie industrial scale carbon
 capture



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 Stability is important for everyone, from individuals to businesses. This issue needs to move beyond politics.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Exceptional circumstances need to be defined, ie only from non-climate change-related natural disasters. It would be a pity for a

 climate change-related hurricane to be used as an excuse not to address climate change.



 Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The government should be compelled by law to honour the feedback received in public consultation. Previously consultations on
climate change were a farce. Huge numbers of people supported strong action on climate change and this was ignored.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

Giving powers to a non political body will hopefully encourage stability and responsibility



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Requiring expertise would prevent a political party from choosing a commissioner who will simply toe the line of their political agenda.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
New Zealand needs to play its role in addressing climate change. Iâ€™ve been embarrassed by the way we have (under the previous

government) buried our heads in the sand before now.
