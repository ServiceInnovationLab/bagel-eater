Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill








Reference no: 11619


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 Can be counted as carbon dioxide equivalents. For example, x amount of co2 can cancel out the warming effect of x amount of

 methane. Therefore, “net zero methane” does not necessarily need to be achieved specifically by methane reductions, and can be
 achieved by reductions of other gases in equivalence. The equivalence cancellation to net zero must be achieved immediately for an
 equilibrium effect in real-time, and not be a delayed onset net-zero effect.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes

 Tackling climate change needs to be a global effort. This option is only chosen if there is a robust method for ensuring that the
 international carbon units have integrity for being able to achieve GHG reductions. The climate change commission should advise on

 the ratio of permitted domestic versus international units.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes

 It can be changed only if we are able to set more ambitious goals. It should not be revised for the sole purpose of conforming to the
 rest of the world. All efforts must be made to ensure that technology is available so that we can meet our goals, and that roadblocks
 to this are addressed and removed.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes

 The third budget can be changed to be more ambitious. It can only be changed to other way around in predetermined extreme and
 dire circumstances.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

What are the roadblocks and how can we address and remove these? Must make all efforts into this, rather than ignoring roadblocks
because they are too complex and difficult. A classic example of avoiding a roadblock was not wanting to include dairy in ETS because

it was too complicated. The climate change commission needs to advise in this area for the best interest of the environment, and any
deviations from the advice needs to be robustly and formally justified by the government.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

Any deviations to the advise must have robust and formal justification by the government.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Another essential attribute is expertise in technology and innovation on dealing with and combating climate change. Economic
person should also have financial expertise. Someone needs to understand sustainability management.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

I wish to be anonymous for any publications of my response in this form, and for any submissions that the Ministry may publish.
