Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Reference no: 11140

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 Our economy should be geared to meet desired outcomes. If we take the housing crisis as an example, we can set up incentives to
 reach desired outcomes. If rocketing house prices was the goal, it has worked. If increasing CO2 absorption, or cutting emissions is
 the goal, we can make that work too, we just need to change the current model. We should aim at being the ones selling carbon

 credits, not buying them. We used to send plastic to China for them to deal with our mess, and that has worked out badly for us, and
 buying carbon credits would also be at risk of turning out badly for us.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 Incentives and circumstances should be changed to reach the goal.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes
 It is always too easy to change the budget to suit what is easy now. The only acceptable outcome would be to make the budget

 more stringent in eliminating emissions and emission capture. Experience tells us that this will be highly unlikely.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
There can always be exceptional circumstances that change things. War, natural disasters and climate tipping points would be

examples. eg, war on our own shores or nearby, volcanic activity in Auckland or major earthquakes in Wellington, sudden catastrophic
collapse of a major ice shelf like Greenland.




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

All industry have developed under the models and rules of the past. The rules need to change. The cost of transitioning to meeting
the new rules needs to be acceptable by the business making the transition. Subsidies on technology and developing technology, or

tax incentives. The tax free nature of the housing market has worked to increase house and land prices at an exceptional rate. That
method should be applied to the emissions situation.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
It's time for action. This can be used to create a major social change making living and working in New Zealand more fair for everyone.

The current model has increased the gap between the rich minority and the growing poor majority, and all this at the expense of the
environment and the planet. That ridiculous situation can be stopped now.
