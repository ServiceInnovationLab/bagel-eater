Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Laurie-ann Foon






Reference no: 11849


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 I think we need to be more ambitious with the target and move it to 2040, but a clear target is needed now, to show leadership and
 provide greater certainty. The business sector urgently needs this certainty to encourage innovation and investment in low carbon
 solutions.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases
 Notes




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Yes, this seems to provide the necessary certainty. Whilst a ‘straight line’ reduction pathway may not be appropriate for legislation it

 should be seen as a reference point/guide. We must be wary of low ambition for early periods, for two main reasons. First it might
 send the ‘wrong message’ and result in less incentive for action (thereby threatening the necessarily more ambitious reduction in
 later periods); and second it would mean the cumulative emissions for the whole period (to 2050) would be higher. Given the long-life

 of CO2 and N2O this would ‘lock-in’ additional warming. It is important to understand that it is the area under the emissions curve
 which determines the cumulative emissions, and contribution to warming, not just the end point.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes
 Yes, but only when subsequent budget is set, and only under a short list of clearly defined exceptional circumstances.



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Yes, it should be advisory. It would be inappropriate for it to have decision-making powers, given the potential impacts of any

decisions – such decisions should be made by elected representatives. However, it is essential that there is full transparency over
the advice given, and that the government should be compelled to publish a detailed response to the advice, providing clear reasons

if the advice is not followed.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

Advisory, for the same reasons as Q11. And, like Q11, there should be full transparency and detailed responses if advice is not
followed.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Agree that the commissioners should be experts, rather than stakeholder representatives. Agree with the list of essential and
desired expertise, except unconvinced on the essential need for the commissioner with community engagement/communications

expertise (couldn’t that be provided by support staff?), but do see the essential need for expertise in innovation and its development
and deployment (including introducing new technologies from overseas).




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes. It seems prudent that this should be covered (as it is under the UK system), but the clear emphasis should be on mitigation
(reducing our emissions).




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
Yes. There is a clear need for an integrated approach, co-ordinated at a national level (led by central government). The current

arrangement is piecemeal and very inadequate, with an unreasonable burden placed on local authorities.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes. Follow the UK model with a requirement for mandatory reporting by key organisations in the public and private sectors.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
I think we need to be more ambitious with the target. With adaptation, I think we need to create some sort of "just" insurance system

or back up support for those in NZ living in at-risk areas. The insurance costs are already going to have a massive impact on some of
those who are already financially pressured, let alone those who may become climate change refugees.
