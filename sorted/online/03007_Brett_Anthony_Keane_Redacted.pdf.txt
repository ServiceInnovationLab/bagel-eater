Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill


Brett Keane, Brett Anthony Keane








Reference no: 3007


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 No reason for one. The Arctic Oscillation it turning cool (eg Atlantic Cod back in British waters. The Pacific Oscillation has been cool for ten years, the Antarctic for longer. Last cool arctic, some of

 th0se now crying hot, were fearing an Ice Age. Each c.63yr full cycle, we get this alarmism along the way.)



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Notes
 Real mixed forestry on land above "Moderately Steep" rating is a good idea, but with better managment and local end-use. We can make wood like steel now....




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position

 Yes
 Notes




 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes

 No govt may bind any future one, in a democracy.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Notes
 Ditto above (7)




 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

 Position

 No
 Notes




 Clause

 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
 Notes

 We need to consider that the Models used are totally useless as admitted in AR4 and before. They are only predicated on a CO2 knob, and cannot handle clouds or water vapour, nor
 convection etc on the fine or medium scales. The computing power needed is close enough to infinite. The Russian ones are least wrong, because they incorporate solar cycles. AR5 is just

 waffling, using non-scientific 'scenarios' etc as if they had meaning.




 Clause
 11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our

 Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
 Notes




 Clause

 13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise. Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our
 Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes

 Notes

 Skilled Experimental physisicsts are needed, to show what gases are and are not capable of, and how radiation operates. Also how it is not heat.



 Clause

 14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

 Notes
 Zero carbon is death. Carbon chemistry is Organic Chemistry, the chemistry of Life. Life has been happier at about ten times the current levels.....




 Clause
 15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

 Position

 No
 Notes




 Clause
 16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their exposure to climate change risks?

 Notes

 Climate changes, or it would not be named. Untill the next glaciation, sea levels will rise, so sensible building rules are a good idea. 200m setback from seas for instance. Mitigation as needed
 by sound engineering and agricultural practice.




 Clause

 Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
 Notes
We have been studying this subject for years ( I have a Degree and Grad Dip (Massey 2006) and 70yrs of experience. We recently identified the onset of the current 'Quiet Sun' period and

anticipate the current cooling phase to last at least 20yrs more. In the cycle (mainly from oceanic solar input) of c63yrs, we are at a similar stage to the early 1960s which I remember well. It is
not hotter now. We also know why Maurice Strong started this CAGW thing. It is political, not scientific. "On page 982 from WD1AR5 final they don​t call it a plateau, but it is what it is." ​The ASK

results and the initialised predictions both suggest that those CMIP5 models that warm most rapidly over the period (1986​2005) to (2016​2035) may be inconsistent with the observations.​
