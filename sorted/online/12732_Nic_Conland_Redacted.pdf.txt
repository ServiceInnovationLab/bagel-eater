Submission on the Zero Carbon Bill

Summary

      1. This submission is made on behalf of Wairakei Pastoral Limited. Wairakei Pastoral Limited
          (WPL) is the freehold owner of the 25,723 hectares (ha) Wairakei Estate (the Wairakei Estate)
          north of Taupo. Since theestablishment of the Enterprise in 2004, 15,734ha (or 61 percent of

          the site) has been progressively developed for farming activities, with the land now primarily
          used for dairy farming.


      2. The Estate’s future development will involve continued land use chan ges to establish the
          appropriate balance between farming activities and retired areas that achieves environmental

          and economic sustainability. The Estate is located on land dominated by free draining pumice
          soils and originally comprised of pine plantation, including the Tahorakuri and Broadlands
          Forests in the north (the Tahorakuri Block) and the forest east of Mt Tauhara in the south (the

          Tauhara Block). Each area has distinctively different characteristics.


      3. The Enterprise is a significant pastoral andforestry complex. As shown in Figure 1 below, the

          Enterprise is primarily used for farming activities, with approximately 61% of the Enterprise
          area being used for dairy, dairy support, dairy sheep and Lucerne, followed by 39% used for
          plantation forestryand retired areas.






















                              Figure 1: Landuse proportions on the Estate


      4. The Tahorakuri Block comprises of gently undulating broad plateaus of pumice, with a mean
          land surface slope of 5 degrees. For the most part, this block is crossed by few streams due to
      the highly permeable nature of the soils, which limits surface runoff. The topographic contours

      vary from approximately 300 to 550m AMSL, although the vast majority of the area is at
      approximately 350-450m AMSL.


  5. The Tauhara Block comprises generally steeper land with a mean land surface slope of 9.5
      degrees and a greater propensity of steeply incised drainage valleys. The topographic contour

      of this block is significantly more variable than that of the Tahorakuri Block, ranging from
      approximately 300m AMSL adjacent to the Waikato River to approximately 800m AMSL in the

      south. Steeply incised drainage valleys disturb the topographic pattern in the west (Orakonui
      Stream) and in the south (Pueto, Sexton and Paetataramoa Streams).

  6. The Estate has both a transactional andlong-term relationship to both the administration of

      the Zero Carbon Bill and to sustainable land management to achieve climate change objectives.

  7. This submission seeks to provide some examples of current issues with the  parties responsible

      foradministeringtheEmissionsTradingScheme(ETS)andideasfor improving participationand
      performance of the proposed Bill.


  8. The submission is divided into three topics to which relate to the Estates experiences.

  9. We wish to be heard in relation to this submission.


1. Transaction issues with current Emissions Trading Scheme


  10. The Estate has been a participant andaccountholder intheETSsince 2004.

  11. TheseexperienceshaveinvolvedtheEstateinnumeroustransactionandstaffinteractionsover

      thesuccessiveyears.Toenabletheofficeof theMinistryresponsibleforimplementingtheZero
      Carbon Act successful we strongly recommend that the process is appropriately resourced. In

      the current process an applicant can be left waiting for up to three months to receive a reply
      on anapplication or a query.


  12. We also experience a strong focus on detail which involves tedioususe of resources to resolve
      issues like whether a shadow is a tree or not. This use of agreed and consistent datasets is an

      important foundation for an accountancy framework and we recommend consultation on this
      data and agreement prior toimplementation.

  13. Agreement on the datasets used in the implementation, should also allow reporting on

      performance on the outcomes sought from the Bill.

  14. Given the likely issues and disagreement between parties we recommendthere isa resolution

      or arbitration processincluded in the Bill. This maybe the role of anindependent party or the
      proposed Climate Commission.
  15. The independent body should be a nationally represented body with a national database and
      an access portal to enable applicants and those interacting with thedata the ability for ease of
      viewing. This independent body should be resourced with field staff andadvisors for the ETS

      process.

  16. We strongly support the use of remote sensing technology such satellite data to provide

      background datasets in real time andcollected toprovide a temporal record.


2. Framework to include wider carbon mitigations

  17. The current ETS fails toincentivise a range of mitigation options for plantings which couldif
      included sequester carbon in the rural and potentiallyurban environments. The Estate
      believes that the inclusion or provision of a pathway to inclusion of a broader range of

      mitigation options would encouragewider participation and credit landowners for the work
      undertaken for wider environmental benefits.

  18. The current facility for including riparian areas is on an explicit geographic basis, this apoch
      is a symptom of the technology available atthe time of the ETS. New technology with finer

      resolution foraccurate planting surveys means that a wider range of mitigation options could
      be included. These could include but not be limited to

        a. Wetland Plantings
        b. Erosioncontrol plantings

        c. Shelter belts

  19. Inadopting this approach, a ‘sum’ of the areas asthe qualifyingarea(aggregate) could be
      used to determine the overallsequestration from a property.


  20. As such we think that an area-based criterionsuch as 1Ha minima should be removed.

  21. The value in this approach is that it has a direct relationship to other environmental demands
      on the property such as Farm Environment Plans and theirrelationship to other farm

      objectivessuch as the control of hillside erosion or stock exclusion.

  22. The existing schedule for approved species has limitations for trialing other tree types or
      planting options. We think that a schedule fordeterminingthe relative sequestrationfor each
      species should replace a fixed list. Inthis way the organizationwith governance responsibility

      for the Act would maintain a flexible list and a review/adoption process.

  23. The Estate has a dynamicapproach to landuse where changes are driven by environmental
      and economic efficiency. Inpractice this means that landuse canchange relative tomarket
      conditions and whether freshwater objectives are being met.


  24. Under the currentETSapproach it is unclear and uncertain whether a whole of life approach
      is possible for collecting carboncredits.
        a. Example Ifaradiatarotationisharvestedat 25 years due to high log prices, there isa

            ‘carbon’ penalty to the land or carbon right owner.

  25. We think that a subsequent rotation replanted should be able to collect further carbon at year
       26 inthe same location. As it at this point increases the whole of lifesequestration from that
       forestry block.


  26. By including the ability to have rates for sequestering relative to planting cycle– i.e. the ability
       to harvest early and late on same block and collect the difference relative to the age class.
       Will encourage landowners to keep trees sequestering carbon when the carbon price is high
       relative to the wood price.


  27. The Estate supports the introduction oflivestock to the ETS as long as there is agreement on
       the approach to mitigations and offsetting between properties and landowners.


  28. We also believe that this should be concurrent with the development and roll out of portal-
       based calculation tools such asOVERSEER FMor other tools developedas fit for purpose.

  29. The current system for carbon liability attaching tolandowner and/or Enterprise needs to be

       maintained to avoid negative liability outcomes by actions of a tenantor lessee.

3. Provision of Soil Carbon accounting into the framework


  30. The Estatebelieves that thelong-term inclusion of soil carbon accounting to the ETS is an
       importantplank for carbon management. The farm scale contributionof soil carbon
       sequestration is low. However, the practice level benefits from retaining C:N ratios are high
       and provide other environmental benefits.


  31. This approach wouldallow for retaining soil carbon levels at a level where carbon is built and
       retained in the soil, while encouraging reduced fertilizer demand and nitrogen efficiency
       leading topasture and horticulturalproductivity.


  32. New Zealand could take a principled position on soil carbon in the international community,
       demonstratingleadershipas a leading edge agricultural economy.

  33. Finally, the inclusion of soil carbon provides ertainty through time for sustainable soil
       management and a long-term view of land ownership and responsibility.
