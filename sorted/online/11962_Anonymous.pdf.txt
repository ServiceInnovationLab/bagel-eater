Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 11962

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 Climate change is a con but we do need targets on specific polluters. The process should be in consultation with the public and

 must require a 75% majority in the House so that it cannot be repealed, unless by a similar majority.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 Too early to set a target now.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Notes
 Given our isolation and small contribution to the global problem of pollution, we should only implement and act upon targets if other

 larger countries do the same.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 Absolutely.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 No

 Notes
 There is a disconnect between a supposed 2050 target which is 32 years away, and having a 15 year budget. If the Government was
 serious about this it would align the 2. Too early for a budget.




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes

 Poor choices. Why only the last budget? See comments above regarding the 32 year [project with 15 years of budgets which is
 nonsense. Any Government should be able to change any and all budgets with the same majority (i.e. 50%+ or 75%+) given this is a
 long term project and circumstances change.




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Any Government should be able to change any and all budgets. See above.



 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

 Notes
Why focus on just carbon? There are plenty of other noxious pollutants we need to deal with. Definitely a plan is needed to achieve

targets but again the choices are poor and the Government should look at all pollutants.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

That citizen taxpayer isn't footing the bill for whack job ideas that the rest of the World does not also commit to. Start by ensuring that
International businesses operating in NZ pay their fair share of tax which can then be used for whatever the Government wants,

including reducing pollution if that is the best way to spend money (this is assuming other more important issues have been solved
such as child poverty and homelessness).



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
Another trough from which troughers can feast until 2050? A global problem needs local solutions - push this onto the Councils with

additional funding from Central Government.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes

Poor choices. We don;t need a Climate Change Commission. See comment above about local councils.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

No comment.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
No no no no no. The climate has been changing for 4 billion years. Deal with the real issue which is pollution, provided other larger

countries also do their part.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

No no no no no. The climate has been changing for 4 billion years. Deal with the real issue which is pollution, provided other larger
countries also do their part.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
No
Notes

No no no no no. The climate has been changing for 4 billion years. Deal with the real issue which is pollution, provided other larger
countries also do their part.




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
We don't need another trough.
