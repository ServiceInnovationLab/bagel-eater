Reference no: 12161

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived

 gases
 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 No

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No

 Notes



 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Position

 No
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
Economic sustainability and competitiveness




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No
Notes

Legislating responses is doomed to failure, and to creating unplanned distortions (rorts) of the system



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No
Notes

The current "Science" is not sufficiently mature to put actions into legilastion



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
The linkage between global warming and non fossil fuel emissions is based on weak pseudo science. Natural systems all emit
methane, there is no baseline available to compare say mature forrest with agricultural methane emissions (insects digesting

cellulose use the same class of methane generating endoteric bacteria as do ruminants) The biggest sources of non fossil fuel
methane is mature forrests and in the current warming cycle release of soil bound methane as a result of changed soil conditions.

The bill aims to treat many unknowns as known, and to create an economically destructive artificaial structure which will further distort
our Quasimodo like economy to the long term detriment of the nation's people. Any carbon trading element should only be included

for the humour factor, and if you have shares in big financial institutions, there will be zero environmental benefit, just a huge parasitic
industry (consider how stumpage carbon is treated in current carbon credits (assumed to be perpetual, silly joke) Fossil fuel
emissions almost directly track population growth, the linkage being the economic and welfare benefits of energy use, Fossil fuels

provide the vast majority of this life giving (and life threatening) energy. Addressing emissions without addressing the underlying
economy, and population driven expansion is futile and foolish. Identify the linkages in the legislation. We need to move away from

population growth driven GDP to a per capita GDP, or wellbeing reference and use this as a basis for targets. Setting targets based
on a single set of parameters is foolish.
