Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Thomas Kulpe









Reference no: 55

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 I don't think IET is a real choice. There wont be affordable (real) carbon units on the international market. The supply curve for carbon
 units will be inelastic.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 Any changes should be enacted i.e should go through the parliamentary process.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 The real issue is not setting budgets (good) but following through an implementation programme on all levels of society. This
 requires statutory reporting of GHG emissions and compliance with targets.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 Any changes should be enacted i.e should go through the parliamentary process.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
 Notes
 Any changes should be enacted i.e should go through the parliamentary process.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

The Commission should also deal with climate justice (contraction and convergence) moving towards a per capita carbon budget that
is the same for all people/countries



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Planning, reporting and setting budgets must happen on all levels of society. In order to transition to a low carbon economy every

organisation must be able to do carbon accounting and budgeting.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

We should be setting up the Climate Change Commission within a constitutional framework for the rights and the protection of Nature
and allow for the quadripartite separation of powers.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Notes
GHG emission (over a set budget) is an offense, not a tradable commodity. If the ETS would have worked 20 years ago , we would not

have in excess of 400ppm now. Let's not waste energy and hope on something like the ETS - it is not a solution but a distraction.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
However, little is said about how the independence of the Commission from legislative or executive influence is safeguarded.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes, it is 5 past 12. Mitigation alone will not do. We are already living in the time of consequences



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Carbon sequestration by planting trees (even permanent forests) is not sustainable, we will quickly run out of land. The idea that it will

buy us time until new technologies come on stream is suicidal if these technologies don't emerge. The low emission economy must
be the priority. Let's include in our GHG budget emissions from air and sea transport to/from NZ and start looking how we can reduce

emissions created by tourism and the livestock industry.
