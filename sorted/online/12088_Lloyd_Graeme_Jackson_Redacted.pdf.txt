Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Before the government wastes precious tax it needs to be absolutely sure that carbon is harming civilization. New Zealand could also

use the annual $1.4 billion for its own citizens by stopping payment to the failed Paris Accord. That money could be used to build
houses for the homeless. According to satellite data the earth's surface has not warmed in 20 years and that temperatures have
increased considerably less than two degrees celcius since the 1880s. When only 77 scientists of more that 3400 submissions in

the Doran-Zimmerman report are used to scare the populace, it is clear that there is a serious scam taking place. Close the Climate
Commission and stop wasting OUR money.
