Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Oliver Krollmann








Reference no: 223

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 A clear 2050 target will help to accelerate mitigation activities. The second half of the century is too unspecific and might be watered
 down to as far as 2100 by unambitious governments and industries.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 It is prudent to go for the most ambitious target because there will be plenty of resistance and inertia anyway. A less ambitious target

 might be watered down to a level where it doesn't achieve effective climate change mitigation.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes
 Depending on how NZ progresses, some international carbon units might have to be used to achieve targets and stay within

 budgets. I would like to see a cap for these, though, for example no more than 10% overseas reductions, or even a degressive cap
 that reaches 0% in 2050.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 30 years is a long time, and we need to be able to react to changes we are yet unaware of or can't yet predict. A revision to a more
 ambitious target should be possible at any time. A revision to a less ambitious target should only be possible under exceptional

 circumstances.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 I would also be happy with a six-year period, or a period that is tied to the election cycle, to make sure that setting and reviewing

 budgets cannot become an election football at any time.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes

 This will provide enough flexibility to adjust future budgets without undermining short-to-medium-term budgets.



 Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Together with my response to #6 this will provide the necessary flexibility to be able to respond to unforeseen circumstances or
developments.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
This is required to provide planning security for all parties involved.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The plans should be developed in close collaboration with the Climate Change Commission. The CCC should become the one-stop-
shop for both government and business/industry as well as the public when developing and discussing plans.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

In case the government was giving in to political pressure or losing its track to meet the budgets and goals, the CCC could exercise
some influence by shaping the NZ ETS to counteract these issues.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes
NZ hasn't progressed very far in terms of adaptation. I don't see mitigation and adaptation as isolated activities, because changes to

one could have an effect on the other and vice versa. It is prudent to bring them all under one umbrella.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

It is particularly important that adaptation is coordinated at the national level, to avoid that regional or local authorities have to reinvent
the wheel and waste time and resources on adaptation strategies.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
M. bovis has shown us that voluntary reporting and monitoring doesn't work too well, unfortunately. Reporting needs to be mandatory
to ensure quality results, which are needed to shape future policy and budgets. The money needed to set up mandatory reporting

will be well-spent.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Thanks for putting together a fantastic consultation document, and for providing us an easy and straightforward way to have our say.
