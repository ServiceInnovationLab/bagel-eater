Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

David Goodman









Reference no: 9996

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes
 Mankind has mucked around for decades, there should be no more opportunity to veer off course now.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 It's time to get tough. It's the reality we have to face for the generations ahead.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 I would be happy to allow a tougher target to replace the original target though, but not allow a weaker target.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 Having the option to change something implies that the goalposts can be moved and that is not good, because it allows us a cop out
 so to speak. The budget should only be changed if it is tougher than the one it is replacing.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

The impact on poorer people should be structured in a way so that it's cheaper/easier for them to make the better choices for
climate change. For example, providing a reverse scale subsidy (cheaper cars get more of a subsidy than expensive cars) for them

when it comes to purchasing an EV. Poor people can't afford to sponsor climate change initiatives as much as the wealthier people,
but the poorer people will be affected more. There needs to be real financial support to make it easy for the poor people to make the

right decisions.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Businesses across the country and in all industries. This is a country effort, so there will need to be cross subsidisation to lessen the
impact on particular industries like airlines, farming and such.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Fighting climate change is going to cost truckloads of money. Every decision needs to be vetted by the Climate Change Commission.
For example, Dunedin is going to get a new hospital on the site of the old Cadbury's Chocolate Factory. This is a mistake as far as the

site is concerned and a waste of money. That site lacks elevation and will be one of the early victims of rising sea levels. The site for
the new hospital needs to be changed to higher ground. We need both the carrot and stick approach to take on the problem.
Penalise those old school behaviours and reward the better ones. We need to shut down the Huntly power stations and get to 100

percent renewable soon. We don't have any large scale solar generation in New Zealand though. EVs need more of an incentive. New
cars are expensive and if we want to have mass uptake, there needs to be money thrown at them. Many countries have subsidies for

new EV purchase and all we do is waive the RUC and have some transit lane access in Auckland. Introduce a financial subsidy for new
EV purchases. I have attached an example (picture) where only cars costing less than $100,000 can get a subsidy, which is capped
at $5,000 per purchase. This would allow a greater uptake of EVs - I mean if somebody can afford to pay $100,000 for an EV, would a

$1,000 subsidy be a deal breaker? Rather different if your car is costing you $30,000 and you can get a $5,000 subsidy! That could
be the difference between buy an EV vs. a petrol car. Have a look at Norway. The government threw lots of money towards EV

ownership - it was so good, they achieved their target 3 years ahead of schedule. It cost them a lot though, but EVs and hybrids sales
account for nearly 50% of all new vehicles in Norway.
