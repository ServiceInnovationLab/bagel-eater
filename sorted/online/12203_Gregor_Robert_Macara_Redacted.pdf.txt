Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Gregor Robert Macara






Reference no: 12203


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived

 gases
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes

 Our primary focus should be on reducing domestic emissions. We should minimise our reliance on the purchase of international
 carbon units so we are not hamstrung by future fluctuations in carbon unit availability and prices.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Only under clearly-defined exceptional circumstances, which still enable NZ to meet emissions targets consistent with achieving net-
 zero CO2 emissions by the time global warming reaches 2degC. Such circumstances would not include a change of Government.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Only under clearly-defined exceptional circumstances e.g. significant natural disaster or recession. Rules should be defined so that
 subsequent carbon budgets essentially "make up" for any emission-reduction hiatus resulting from exceptional circumstances, to
 ensure the ultimate goal of Zero Carbon Bill is achieved. This should help incentivise early and strong measures for emission-

 reduction 'while the going is good', so we are positioned as well as possible in case of significant natural disaster etc.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Budgets must be set based off sound, internationally-accepted scientific evidence. The Government should keep abreast of
what/how strongly-performing countries are achieving their emission reductions and strong economic performance, and collaborate

with these countries to ensure knowledge and learning is shared. Equally, we should observe other countries who are struggling with
emission reduction and strong economic performance, and learn from their mistakes. As always, NZ Government must keep in mind

that NZ circumstances are unique; e.g. just because something is working well overseas, doesn't necessarily mean it will work well
here.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Expertise on sustaining and enhancing our natural environment and native biodiversity is a crucial component of our Climate Change
Commission.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
This is crucial as the climate is already changing and will continue to do so. Central Govt. needs to take charge and provide direction
and leadership for the benefit of local Govt., sectors, businesses and communities.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Tourism is a huge and ever-growing component of our economy. Tourists are inherently high emitters of GHGs. This is exacerbated by
NZ being a relatively isolated country geographically on a global scale (huge emissions required just to get here), as well as being a

spread-out nation (high emissions required to explore our country), not to mention the emission-intensive nature of some tourist
activities (e.g. scenic flights). Perhaps the Government could consider some form of small visitor levy, the proceeds of which are used
to contribute to forestry planting/purchasing international carbon units.
