Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Johanna Bennett, Johanna Bennett






Reference no: 12319


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 This submission supports the Zero Carbon Bill as the bare minimum we need.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Notes

 This could result in foot-dragging...



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Notes
 Not sure - this is not very clear.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes

 ... depends exactly what the exceptional circumstances are - again, could be used a foot-dragging tactic.



 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 An actual plan always helps in keeping people focused.



 Clause
 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
 Notes

 The stakeholders affected in the forestry and agricultural sectors, plus the energy companies, and Māori, because we are a bicultural
 country.



 Clause

 11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
 its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

ZERO CARBON BILL SUBMISSION



It’s about our children’s children

Why we need the Zero Carbon Bill or the world will be one big slum




















It’s about the children – the tamariki of the future. It’s about our grandchildren and our great-
grandchildren; those future generations who we can see and hold now, or else easily imagine.

I came to New Zealand decades ago now, and remember walking on wild, windy, pristine
Waikanae beach and being stunned at how clean and beautiful it was. And, before that, how

perfectly clean the air was when I first stepped off the plane at Wellington Airport.

This is how the whole world should be. Not a world of filthy shirt-cuffs after a journey on the
London tube, or wading through dirt and thrown-way plastics in the Mediterranean when you
go on holiday, hoping to escape city dirt for a couple of weeks.

The stories we are hearing now are so quiet, but already so close to home: how in Kiribati
they are thinking about the day when the seas will be high all the time and there will be no
more fresh water. Then they will all have to leave their island home forever. Many of them
are already here in New Zealand. They would rather be at home.



  In Kiribati they are thinking about the day when the seas will be high all the
                     time and there will be no more fresh water



We only have only one home – the Earth. And if we heat it up too much, which is what
carbon gases are doing very quickly now – we will very soon have no home, or such a
desperate, filthy, over-crowded one we will be living one big worldwide slum.
I have seen slums, and I have lived in dirty places. I don’t want the whole world to be like
this. I don’t want my children and my children’s children’s home to be like this. My tamariki
and mokopuna – all our tamariki and mokopuna – deserve better.


This is why I think the Zero Carbon Bill is so important – we may be small, so we don’t emit
as much dangerous carbon gas as bigger nations, but small nations like ours are nevertheless
responsible for 30 per cent of all the greenhouse gases that are heating up the world,
threatening to make it uninhabitable. So, what we do – and don’t do – does make a
difference. A zero carbon law will help a lot here.



Consumers can’t do it all

We can stop using plastic bags. We can stop consuming mountains of polluting fast fashion.
We can do this and much more on a personal level. And personal choices do make a
difference. But the problem and the solution is bigger than this, which is why we need
governments to step in, and why we need the Zero Carbon Bill – so we can become carbon
neutral by 2050. The Bill – and then law – will provide the necessary government push to

achieve this.



















Penzance – Britain’s first plastic-free town



We are so lucky in that our hydro-electricity supply already provides 65 per cent of our
power already, but we need to push to use other renewable energy sources more if we are to
get to 100 per cent renewables, and so make real progress in becoming carbon neutral. If
Norway can do it, we can. We could, for example, increase our use of wind power.

And we could plant more trees. They are a highly cost-effective way of reducing carbon

emissions. We already use our new forests to offset 30 per cent of our greenhouse gas
emissions. So, as we have already got a good start in this area, doing more won’t be so hard.
And, once again, the Zero Carbon Bill being made law would help give the necessary
push.
The biggie – farming


Our Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, has already said we can’t keep breeding more cows to
make more milk products for export. Farmers are currently exempt from our Emissions
Trading Scheme (ETS), which requires emitters to pay for the carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gases they emit. To achieve net zero we will have to change this, as farming
activity creates than half of our carbon emissions. Of course, the change will have to be
gradual, but we can’t ignore the big cow in the room.



                 Farming… we can’t ignore the big cow in the room





Well, as I said at the beginning of my submission: we need to think about the world we leave
our tamariki. New Zealand has made a good start, but we need a push – all people need a
push, it’s our nature – and that’s what I think passing the Zero Carbon Bill into law will do.

We can use baskets rather than plastic bags; we can think about our use of disposable
nappies; we can choose not to have a lovely open fire in our sitting room belching nasty gases

into the atmosphere, but, as individuals, we can only do so much. We need to join forces to
effect real change and that is what the Zero Carbon Bill is all about – helping us join our
energies together, so we become one big voice demanding that New Zealand really be clean
and green – and helping make the whole world as safe and beautiful too.
