Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Karen Parr








Reference no: 9539

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 It is crucial to set certain aspects of the legislation in stone NOW. Let's take this opportunity to fix a deadline for zero emissions.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 I don't believe we can buy our way to zero carbon, it has to be a commitment as a country - we need to do it ourselves.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Yes, we could bring the date forward if progress is good. We should also be realistic enough to push the date back, but only in
 exceptional circumstances - it is crucial that no future government can wriggle out of the deal.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 The budget and targets should be independent of the government



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No
 Notes



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

We need to work with iwi and the business sector to try to ensure that we have everyone's support, but at the end of the day, the
future of our planet can not be compromised. The important thing will be for governments to be committed and transparent.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

Independence is key



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

There will be opposition to the bill, and there will be companies who will struggle to meet the demands of the bill. Offering support
and networking to those companies and organisations should be part of the process
Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
This Bill is an opportunity for New Zealand to take a stand internationally and demonstrate its commitment to stalling climate change.

A strong and committed stance will gain NZ international respect, and will also benefit the tourist industry, which, let's face it, may go
a long way to offsetting any resultant losses in the mining and agricultural sectors. The success of the Bill hinges on the

independence of the Climate Commission, and the fact that the effects are long-term, and legally binding to successive
governments. I believe that we should not underplay the influence and assistance we can provide for local (South Pacific) neighbours

with regard to climate change, and urge the legislators to view the Bill on a Pacific, not simply national, level. I believe there should be
flexibility in the role of the Commission to be expanded in the future to include, for example, assisting our neighbours to implement
similar measures, ocean clean-ups, reduction of solid waste, etc in the future. Wouldn't it be fantastic if the climate commissions of

countries such as NZ and the UK had international influence and could put pressure on less conscientious nations to follow our lead.
Please don't let us miss this opportunity to do the right thing, New Zealand. There will be economic effects, but the health of our

people and our planet has to come before profit.
