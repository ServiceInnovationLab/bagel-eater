Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 11972

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 New Zealand is best placed to reduce its emissions by itself without having to buy overseas credits. In terms of future sustainability,

 and also the health of the people of New Zealand, reducing our emissions through forestry, swapping agriculture for horticulture, and
 using electric vehicles would be much better.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 It should allow the target to be revised to be zero carbon earlier. 2050 is too late. We are already seeing the serious effects of climate
 change now. Ideally the target should be for 2030. New Zealand needs to lead the way in this area, and be a role model to other

 countries. New Zealand cannot afford to lag in this area and wait for bigger countries to make a move. However, the Bill should not
 allow the target to be revised to allow us to reach zero carbon later.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes
 if governments can change the emissions budget then they might be able to allow New Zealand to not reduce its carbon emissions

 as fast as needed. We have seen previous governments do this, so I don't think they should be able to be changed to allow more
 leeway for governments.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
Notes

Governments keep changing their emissions budgets, and New Zealand failed its obligations under the Kyoto Protocol, so in my view,
they should not be able to review it and change it. Following a natural disaster or other exceptional circumstances, climate change

policy should not be the first thing to get changed to protect our economic position. Instead we should borrow more money. New
Zealand is a growing country, and we will be able to pay back the money in the future. If we do ensure that our targets are met, even

under exceptional circumstances, then we will be better placed to provide a home to people to ensure our government keeps
growing and working.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

It is important to consider the socio-economic health of people who will be affected. This means the government needs to act quickly
to begin to transition high carbon industries to something else. However I am concerned about the commissions three government

objectives "sustainable economy, global and local leadership, and creating a just and inclusive society." I think it is very important to
create these, but the overall government objective should be working towards lowering our emissions. And these three objectives

should be the result of lowering our emissions. It is really important that the climate change commissioners have the scientific
knowledge that our economy cannot be sustainable if we continue to emit at the rate that we are, or even if we reduce it slightly. It is

very important that the climate change commissioners are faced with the reality of the effects of climate change so that they create
policy that takes that into account. I do think that the objectives of creating global and local leadership are great, and creating a just
and inclusive society. The objective of creating a sustainable economy is good as long as the commissioners have a strong scientific

understanding to inform their decisions.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes
This is very important. Governments have short term thinking because of the nature of our short electoral cycle, and so we need to

set clear targets that governments cannot leave to the next government to sort out (which they inevitably will not because something
more immediately pressing will come up).




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Low income groups - studies show that low income families that work closely with the land, and especially indigenous people are

more likely to be affected by climate change. The government needs to ensure that they are protecting our climate for our most
vulnerable people, and for those who rely on the land. The government needs to ensure that it makes these targets with iwi and

hapu to ensure they are consistent with tikanga Maori.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

But also I think they should have decision making power. This means that the Climate Change Commission will have much better
ability to ensure that we do actually stick to our targets. While no other country has done this, this would be New Zealand trail blazing
the way. We really need to ensure that there are people who have strong power who can act to ensure our environment and climate

is protected, despite other political issues. We rely on our environment for everything, and if we do not have a stable climate
everything else will be destabilised too.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes
Its independence will ensure that the Climate Change Commission does what is best for the New Zealand environment, regardless of

our economic situation. We must prioritise our climate before the economy if we want to continue living on this Earth.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
It's also really important that the climate change commissioners have an understanding of tikanga Maori, and include experts in

tikanga and Te Ao Maori, to ensure that we incorporate matauranga Maori into the expertise.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes
We are already facing the effects of climate change. This bill is so important to slow the progression of climate change, but we still

need to ensure that we are adapting to the new climate as well.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
Yes these provisions will be really important in the coming years, and ensure we are prepared for the changes to our climate.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
I worry about climate change every single day and have for as long as I can remember (I am 24). Most days I get sad for climate

change related reasons - the winter is not as cold as it should be, increased forest fires, more severe storms, etc. It really scares me
because I don't know what will happen to the world. New Zealand has a great climate, but with climate change increasing it looks like

most of the world will become difficult to live in. New Zealand needs to be able to feed and house more people, and also make sure
that it takes care of its forests and oceans so that they can absorb carbon. It is really heartening to see an action like this because it

makes me hopeful that we can slow the progression of climate change.
