Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Adrian Reid








Reference no: 1545

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 The answers are heavily biased and not giving objective enough definitions. The government needs to better research and

 implement or fund to quicker implement alternatives uses of technology before banning and upheaving current methods of practise.
 Give us better access to a better way system or materials and infrastructure and we will organically take it up enmass don't punish us
 by taxation for simply existing with no reasonable alternative systems readily available



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 Stop giving us leading questions don't set a net zero target by 2050



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Notes
 This is bulshit, forestry is only a temporary carbon soak, eventually the trees die and decay releasing the carbon again and buying
 carbon credits achieves nothing except making another country rich



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Our only hope is the next government flushing this turd of an idea down the toilet



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 We will never see a change in the global environment from our efforts and we will waste millions or billions on it further destroying our
 economy we should be focusing on cleaning our local environment until more larger countries are prepared to cooperate and fight

 this collectively



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes

 This should not be set at all as it will achieve nothing except raise or costs of living and inflation even more than this government
 already is we can only prey the next government puts it out with the trash



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 The government should not be setting unrealistic expensive pointless emissions goals
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

I haven't read them but I guarantee they are idealistic un reasonable not practical expensive and will ultimately achieve nothing. Our
countries population makes up 0.055% of the global population so any efforts we make alone will be futile



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

No
Notes

No because it will achieve nothing we should set our sights on cleaning up our local environment before tackling an impossible task
like single handed altering the global climate



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
You need to consider the reality of what you will achieve and how much it is going to impact on our economy, when and by how much

can you prove beyond reasonable doubt any of these hairbrained ideas will show significant success



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes
The climate change commission is a fraud a waste of money and should be disbanded




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes

The emissions trading scheme is a scam and a fraud and we should have nothing to do with it



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes
The only expertise the climate change has is fooling you into buying what it's selling and it's preparing to take you for the ride of your

lives



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes
Before we spend money we need proof what we are planning to do will have A measurable effect on the global environment




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes
Climate change is a natural phenomenon and we are incredibly arrogant to think we can have that much effect on it especially NZs

0.055% of the global population
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
No

Notes
Stop spending money on something that will achieve no measurable outcome, the Hawaii volcano is doing more "harm" to the

environment than this scam of a scheme could hope to undo in several life times



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Anthropogenic climate change is a sham and we can't. Alter the global climate without massive cooperation from many much larger

countries we dont have to be the leaders at everything especially not spending time and money pushing the proverbially up hill to
accomplish nothing significant! Don't set emission targets until we can measure the benefit of doing so or fund cleaner alternatives

so we organically move to them more quickly and the larger scale of use will also bring the costs diwn
