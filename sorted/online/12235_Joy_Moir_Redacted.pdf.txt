Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Reference no: 12235

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 Urgency is the order of the day. There are so many financial, environmental and social benefits for setting a target now to enable long
 term business investment, diversification and maximum carbon reduction. By setting a target now, stability and certainty are enablers

 for everyone to make smart choices



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 The most ambitious targets should be set to enable maximum push and opportunity. That said, I understand Methane creates a
 complex issue nationally. However, accelerating the carbon dioxide target to being even more ambitious than 2050 (target 2040) may

 help other gases in the long term. The reality is though, if we do not stay as close to 1.5 degrees increase, nature may decide what
 the long term opportunities are. We have to be brave, courageous and lead as we are a small enough country to change our own
 course.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 We should not be using international carbon units to offset our emissions. We should also not be having such a heavy reliance on

 forestry as that may allow us not to concentrate and innovate in other sectors and industry's with the urgency and funding forestry
 might get. Future generations need us to evolve our way of living on every aspect in order for them to even live simply.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 This target should be non-negotiable, with the only exception of natural disasters needing us to re-think our future requirements.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 Short term targets/budgets will enable industry and legislation to have some level of short term goals to aim for enabling certainly and
 direction. The reporting on these should be very transparent, so everyone can see where we are winning and where we need to
 focus our efforts. The ability to manipulate the reporting must be impossible. Honesty must be the goal here. No one wins if the

 numbers are not true.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes

 An incoming government may not be in situ by the tine the third budget becomes reality so I struggle with giving them that freedom.
However, I accept these budgets may have to change in order to meet the long term goals. The Climate Commission must be able to

help steer and guide any changes.



Clause

7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Unless under extremely exceptional circumstances - with the agreement of the wider Country so the Government does not have the
complete decision making ability.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
Transparency has to be achieved all the way through to ensure everyone understands the severity, complexity and difficulty involved.

As Climate Change increases around us, more people will become more consciously aware and wanting/needing to understand what
is being achieved. Sharing plans will engage the debate required nationally to ensure the changes needed, happen.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Target Topics - Reducing Carbon, divesting away from all fossil fuels, reversing of mobility so car is lest favored and infrastructure can

support low carbon movement. Housing - Enabling passive house living. Industry - Diversification into less intensive industries to
enable growth in a smart carbon free world. Who - Industry leaders, sustainability and climate experts, climate scientists, innovate
entrepreneurs, community leaders, global experts who have demonstrated clear climate change leadership. Targets/plans -

Meaningful, relatable, high level with the ability to break down into regional targets/plans. The plans must all be science based to
ensure they are ultimately impactful and will help NZ contribute in holding Climate change at 1.5 degrees.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
The Government will need objective, expert support, steerage and advice to ensure all the right elements are being considered.

Collaboration and co-design will ensure a richer outcome for all. The CCC has a very important role to ensure the Government is
always held to accounts for its actions and outcomes.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

The CCC needs international input, science, business, environmental, cultural and community expertise. All groups need
representation to ensure richer targets, plans, which in turn will make change more possible. If the Commissioners are all of the same
diversity their advice will not be representative of the Country and the lives in which they live. Priority needs to be given to the

environmental and climate change experts as they must always showcase what is happening on a global scale to ensure NZ is not
left behind.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

But, built up over time as impacts are better understood as to what is impactful for NZ.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
