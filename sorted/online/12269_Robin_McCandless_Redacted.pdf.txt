Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Robin McCandless








Reference no: 12269

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 The most urgent action is required. 2050 may be too late, but it appears to be the fastest target that is politically feasible without a
 dictatorship or a centrally planned economy (eg China). So, lets make it bold, binding and unambiguous. Businesses will stop fighting

 climate action once the inevitability of their future translation sets in, and it becomes a race to the future.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 The boldest target please. New Zealand is a small part of the global problem, but we can show bold political and moral leadership and
 inspire and motive campaigns in the larger polluters. We did it with our anti nuclear stance, lets do it with climate.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 I have seen no persuasive evidence that a global regulator can possibly ensure the integrity of internationally traded carbon credits

 with bullet proof audibility, continuously for the next 50 years. We should sort our own house, in our own borders, and seek to
 become _the_ high integrity exporter of excess carbon credits. As a rich OECD nation, with abundant renewable energy options and
 low population density we should be racing Iceland to be at the head of the pack.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 We should embed a ratchet clause to allow the goals to become faster and more aggressive if scientific evidence continues to

 accumulate the the climate crisis is even more urgent that currently believed.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 The Climate commission should set the budget based on science. Politicians are notoriously bad at the discipline of long term
 planning for long term benefit. The Climate commission should have the ability to ratchet the carbon budget tighter, but never to

 loosen it.



 Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

The Climate commission should set the budget based on science. Politicians are notoriously bad at the discipline of long term
planning for long term benefit. The Climate commission should have the ability to ratchet the carbon budget tighter, but never to
loosen it.




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes
Markets alone cannot achieve our emissions goals. Direct government intervention will be needed for society wide systems such as

energy and transport. Farming will need massive financial government support to achieve a transition in time.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

1. Accelerate the move to 100% renewable electricity. Its small, but symbolic. This will require direct government intervention via bans
on thermal generation, splitting up the gentailers by government purchase of the generation assets and government sale of the retail

arms, and possibly capitalising the generators by direct government funding of consented but unbuilt wind generation. 2. 100% zero
emissions land transport. We need to accelerate this by a) Government sanctioned monopoly of the public fast charging network

(either PPP or SOE) b) A generous "feebate" scheme for light electric vehicles, c) electrification of 100% of the rail system, d) moving
significant volumes of heavy freight off the roads onto rail.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes
Politicians are not good long term custodians. They will find reasons they need to be "expedient" or "practical", and water down the
targets "just for a year or 2 until the economy can recover". This is not acceptable. Physics does not care about election campaigns.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes
This is a related but separate challenge. It needs different thinking, expertise and political framing. Lets land the Zero Carbon Bill as a

mitigating instrument first, then have the adaptation conversation.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes

Notes
