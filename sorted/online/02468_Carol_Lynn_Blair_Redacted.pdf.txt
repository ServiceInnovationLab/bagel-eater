Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Carol Lynn Blair









Reference no: 2468

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes
 We need to set a target NOW, not wait for a committee



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 The goal must be set high, as it is not clear what is actually needed to avoid disaster. Even net zero emissions might not be enough if

 too much GHG is in the atmosphere now.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 Low Carbon dioxide production might not be adhered to by those countries. Stick to what we can control.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 The 2050 target may need to be made stricter, that is set earlier or including more GHGs or more offsets like planting forests. The
 target should NOT be revised lower unless temperature has started to decline and there is no danger of reaching tipping points. (I

 cannot imagine that this latter would happen by 2050, though)



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 3 5year periods are a minimum, though. Shorter periods would encourage quicker adjustments to the target, if needed.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes
 They should only be able to lower the target if my condtions mentioned in to Q.4 have been met. Raising the target should be

 allowed.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
No

Notes
Only under my conditions in Q 4.




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
Scientific knowledge and relevant tech should be considered. The others should generally not be considered unless they would

make the short term situation, up to 20 years, considerably worse than the long term , 50 to 100 years, situation would have brought.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
Absolutely. Plans without a timr frame are useless. The clock is ticking, and we want to avoid disaster.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Agricultural admissions need to be included straightaway. These are a dominant portion of total national emissions. Farmers need to

be supported in making transitions, but ag endeavors will need to scale back and likely some to shut down.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes
Any non decision making role could well allow the current government to avoid actions necessary to limit climate change



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Maybe matauranga should be separate from science. I AM NOT clear what is meant by sector experts. Business competitiveness is

far less relevant than social impacts in these decisions.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
The document just includes assessing and reporting as adapting. Definitely cover that. To cover the cost of adapting...I suppose that
becomes a part of budget, if the Government decides to?




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

I don't see any functions on pg 47 or thereavout.
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Notes

This could help the government understand implications of climate change decisions, but many changes will need to happen despite
concerns avout them
