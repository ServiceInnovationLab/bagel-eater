Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill











Reference no: 1074

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes

 The Government needs to set progressive targets 2020, 2030, 2040, 2050 in legislation now with the goal to be reaching net zero
 emissions by 2050 at the latest. The Climate Change Commission should monitor, advise but also have the power to veto
 government decisions if they interfere with meeting the emissions targets




 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 If accepting emissions reductions from overseas (international carbon units) means that current intensive land and water usage

 practices continue (intensive dairy farming in particular) as usual, this is unethical and shortsighted. If we meet the emissions targets
 at the cost of our water quality and ecosystem balance, then we are just creating more problems to solve in a future where we will be
 facing greater resource restrictions.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes
 If any emissions budget changes are allowed, they may only be to further reduce the third budget in the sequence. There is no

 scope to become more lenient as time goes on. The option I have selected does not specify that the Govt should have this option;
 and they should not have absolute power over it. The independent Climate Change Commission should be the body to determine
 the emissions budget and the Govt should be expected to act in response to what the Commission decides



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
We will potentially face a greater number of natural disasters in the future as the climate changes, resulting from the damage already

done. This situation is not going to improve if we continue to review and adjust the targets. In the wake of a serious disaster,
resource allocation may mean a larger portion of the emissions budget is spent rapidly, which leaves less of the budget for the
subsequent period. That's all we can afford. These 'exceptional circumstance' events will require a shift away from business-as-usual

following them if there is to be any significant change. If we have the option to regress to greater emission rates, we are closing our
window of opportunity to stabilise the climate. The feedback effects associated with (temperature extremes, storms, droughts) will

not reduce in severity and what are now exceptional circumstances may tend to be the norm



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Business competitiveness doesn't really have a place in this area; we need people working together not in competition. I don't see
business competitiveness expertise necessary in the panel, or even desirable,



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The most vulnerable people (living in low lying, low socio-economic zones) need to be considered. If setting a plan means their food

or job security is compromised, there needs to be some sort of support for them in the transition too. A fair and just transition must
be fair and just for all. Public transport options to replace vehicles and infrastructure to a low carbon system (changing the perception

of vehicle ownership, providing bike or e-bike share schemes, funding electric bus, van and car conversions - which promote skilled,
local industry and are aligned with a low emissions economy) The massive environmental degradation and emissions caused by the
agricultural sector cannot be ignored. Agricultural emissions have to be included in the budgets.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes
The Commission cannot just be an observer or placed on the periphery of the Govt's agenda, but needs to have the power to make

the targets for the Govt to see met. The Commission should reflect what is best for the climate and as an independent entity from
the Government, should have the power to veto the Government when decisions are made contrary to meeting emissions targets.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes
The NZ ETS needs an overhaul. If the Commission is hoping to make a meaningful contribution to the future of Aotearoa, it needs to

have the power to set the targets / available units for the Govt to follow. Agricultural emissions need to be considered in the ETS for it
to be more meaningful and representative. If the Commission is independent of the Govt and has a role focussed on reducing the
severity of climate change, then it will have the power to bypass the lobbyists pushing for exemptions in the agricultural sector




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes
I agree with the following proposed essential expertise and half of the desirable expertise • climate change policy (including

emissions trading) • resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour markets and distribution) • te Tiriti o Waitangi,
te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori • experience with

addressing adaptation challenges like planning, insurance and local government • risk management • engineering and/or
infrastructure • community engagement and communications. • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology

development system.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
The climate is already different than from when I was growing up. We need education and a framework to help make communities and
the economy to be more resilient and adaptable to the changes we will be facing




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
If the UK has had better results from mandatory reporting, we may also have better uptake from implements mandatory adaptation

reporting.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

We are all in this together. The highly competitive business model needs re-structuring to have a more collaborative element. If there
are risks that some organisations are aware of, this should be available and accessible to all that it affects.




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Please implement a framework that makes meaningful positive differences to the environment and the people of Aotearoa.
