 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived

 gases
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 By population control, as double the people = double emissions in general.Especially if all houses are heated to 18 degrees with
 electricity that currently has to be sourced by burning coal/gas; as we are only 80% sufficient with renewables. By substituting coal
 for gas , ban on gas exploration to be repealed. By massive investment in wind/geothermal/?? wave or tide generated power. Avoid

 EVs till price comes down and renewable enery sources are massively increased.and net effect on CO2 emissions properly
 analysed(including environmental impact of Lithium production)(Currently EVs appear to be a money grubbing marketing exercise
 that will have little effect, if any, on net CO2 emissions. Cynically shut Tiwai Point and shift the emissions offshore.
