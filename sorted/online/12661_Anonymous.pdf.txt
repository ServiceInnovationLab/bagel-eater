Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 12661

Submitter Type:    Local Government

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 The temperature of the earth is going to rise regardless of whether we decide to reduce our emissions because of the impact of the
 emissions that have already been released. Not only is it fundamental that we look at how we can reduce our emissions now, we also

 need to be finding other ways to reduce the aftermath of global warming.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No

Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
The fight against climate change should not be limited to focus on the scientific data available and working with the facts. There are
so many other opportunities and groups in various sectors of the NZ economy that can contribute to the mitigation of emissions and

actually reduce the impact of climate change. The world is developing at an accelerated rate and as a result, how people are thinking
and acting is changing dynamically. Policymakers need to be more proactive in engaging with these groups and individuals if it wants

to reduce the impact NZ has on climate change.
