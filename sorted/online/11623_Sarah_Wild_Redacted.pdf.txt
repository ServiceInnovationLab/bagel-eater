Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Sarah Wild





Reference no: 11623

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 Yes, but only in limited circumstances. The long-term target can be only changed by the Government following “significant
 developments” in climate science, or international law. A carbon budget may only be changed following “significant changes” to the
 factors on which the budget was originally set. There are further safeguards. In both situations, the Government must request advice

 from the Climate Commission about the proposed change. If the Government makes a change against the Commission’s advice,
 they must provide a statement justifying their reasons. Finally, Parliament must approve the change by formally passing a motion.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes
 Yes, but only in limited circumstances. The long-term target can be only changed by the Government following “significant

 developments” in climate science, or international law. A carbon budget may only be changed following “significant changes” to the
 factors on which the budget was originally set. There are further safeguards. In both situations, the Government must request advice
 from the Climate Commission about the proposed change. If the Government makes a change against the Commission’s advice,

 they must provide a statement justifying their reasons. Finally, Parliament must approve the change by formally passing a motion.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
But I am wary this will create risk that we will not meet our 2050 target




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
How to support various sectors, setting targets and making plans early so sectors can start adapting asap. Councils will play a crucial
role in having the right rules in their plans, providing necessary infrastructure and educating people on everyday behavioural changes

that need to occur to meet targets (ie, cycleways, subsidies for insulation/solar, composting, waste reduction, which activities to
encourage/discourage within the district/city/regional plan). Community groups who work in environmental sustainability etc. are also

starting to play a huge role in this area, as are schools in educating the next generation. It would be a good start if all Government
departments were operating in the most environmentally sustainable way they could (ie, with regard to waste in particular!) The

biggest thing is working with the sectors of our economy that will be where the 'jobs of the future' will sit, otherwise it is difficult to
start discouraging certain behaviours without a solution at hand!!!



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
