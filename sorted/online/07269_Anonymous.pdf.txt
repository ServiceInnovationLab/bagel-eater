Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill











Reference no: 7269

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes

 Any target that is set should be realistic and not severely impact NZ economy



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Carbon Dioxide - Reducing net carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 Some international carbon units are scams and carbon trading is an industry in itself so we should not foster these schemes unless

 they are fully above board in every aspect.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Notes
 If both practical and economically feasible



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
No
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
Be honest about Climate Change rather than being driven by political agenda. If the Govt is going to include biological emissions from

livestock, if NZ livestock numbers drop, then somewhere else in the world the same quantity of milk/meat is going to be produced
which will have been produced using more greenhouse gases, so the net damage to planet Earth is greater. Animal emissions

should only be included if animal emissions in all other countries is included so it is a level playing field. Also the Govt needs to
consider soil carbon sequestration and encourage soil management practices that are conducive to soil carbon sequestration and

reward land owners who use these rather than destructive management practices. Thirdly there needs to be research to investigate
how much extra carbon our native forests are sequestering. Work done on the Amazon rainforest has shown that since 1980, the
Amazon has sequestered more carbon than all of of the carbon losses in the nine countries it covers. With more CO2 and warmer

conditions the southern forests in particular should be growing more. Also Stewart Island and Auckland Island vegetation should be
increasing with warmer climate and more CO2 which is plant food. NZ Inc will therefore not need to plant a billion trees.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Notes

Again with the ETS, it needs to be honest science and not driven by political ideology. What about all of the sequestration in our
southern forests in Fiordland, Stewart Island, Auckland Islands etc over the past 30 years? What about soil sequestration? Also

agricultural emissions should only be included if other countries include it as our milk and meat products normally have a lot lower
CO2 equivalent per unit of product than other countries, so if NZ produces less product, farmers in other countries will fill in the void,

so the net effect on planet CO2 levels will be worse.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes

Only if it is ultimately positive for the NZ economy



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Again it is important to be honest and not be driven by political agenda.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
I have worked as an agronomist on farms for nearly 30 years. Over his time I have seen a lot of my clients soils improving over time

and building organic matter. Those who use a lot of artificial nitrogen fertiliser or cultivation lose organic matter. Although livestock
may emit a lot of methane and nitrous oxide which are greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, if the soil is acting as a carbon sink,

then this needs to be considered. I have also observed with forestry conversions to pasture, that initially there is very little topsoil the
first year or two, but over time there is a definite topsoil layer being built which is permanent C being held in the soil once it turns
certain to humic compounds. Forestry is not the be all and end all, soils which have grown a crop of trees have less soil carbon than

what sheep and beef farms will have sequestered over the same time. Trees can act as a carbon sink, but once harvested, the
carbon is gone. Soil carbon sequestration is one long term answer to increased CO2 levels and needs to be considered in the big

picture if there is going to be honest science in this whole discussion. Just because Simon Upton excluded soil carbon in the 1990
Kyoto Accord, does not mean it should be excluded in future accords or developments. Scientific knowledge is an ever improving,

more precise pool of knowledge, and needs to be free from political agendas/interference.
