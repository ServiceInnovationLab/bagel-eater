Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Same, John Bernard Williamson









Reference no: 9618

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes
 The government should set the target in law now, with the ability to make the target stronger in response to the Commission’s early

 advice. The target should be based on the most up to date climate science, on our international obligations and on principles of
 global equity (New Zealand is a wealthy, high emitting country and should do its fair share).



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 The emissions budgets must cover all gases and all sectors, as NZ’s main greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous

 oxide) all cause long-lasting damage. The final version of the Zero Carbon Act must be decided in light of the IPCC’s Special 1.5oC
 report due this October.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including reforestation, horticultural planting and improved soil health). International emissions
 units will be volatile in price - and relying on these undermines decisive domestic investment here in NZ.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 Sooner if possible. Global emissions must peak by 2020 at the latest - and NZ needs to lead.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Three 5-year emissions budgets covering the next 15 years, with our “legislated net zero emissions by 2040 target”, gives the
 certainty needed for action and investment now.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes
 The last budget should be able to be reduced if needed to respond to emerging international evidence. The Zero Carbon Act should

 also permit any Government to act so NZ can emit less than budgeted.



 Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

The second budget should be able to be reduced if needed to respond to emerging international evidence. The Zero Carbon Act
should also permit any Government to act so NZ can emit less than budgeted. If there are exceptional circumstances, the
Government can change the Zero Carbon Act, to increase the emissions budget, through the usual Parliamentary process.




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes
The physics of climate change comes first for setting Emissions Budgets - the bottom line is what ends up in our shared global

atmosphere and oceans, and making sure ecological tipping points are not breached.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes
The Zero Carbon Act must require the Government to respond by publishing plans to stay within budget as rapidly as feasible within

a set time limit that is certainly less than 12 months.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The most important issues to consider are Te Tiriti o Waitangi obligations and fairness within Aotearoa-NZ. This means health equity is
essential in planning and monitoring - all regressive policies (including ETS settings) must be effectively offset for vulnerable

communities. The substantial co-benefits to health from well-designed reduction and mitigation must be considered. Other
considerations include sustainable economic opportunities and technology relevant to climate change, to grow a fairer, just,

sustainable Aotearoa-NZ.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
Yes, but also the Commission must set NZ’s Emissions Budgets – like the Reserve Bank independently sets NZ’s Official Cash Rate.

The Commission can also advise how NZ stays within these budgets, how NZ can best adapt to climate change, and monitor
progress on NZ’s emissions reductions.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
The Commission should advise the Government on ETS policy settings so that New Zealand emits within budget.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes, but health expertise amongst Commissioners and staffing is needed too. It is also essential that the Commission is founded on

partnership with tāngata whenua and upholds obligations under Te Tiriti o Waitangi.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
Adaptation must be a separate advisory work stream, to avoid overtaking the Commission’s top priority climate mitigation role.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
I support the following adaptation provisions (which include the health sector): • a national climate change risk assessment • a
national climate adaptation plan • regular review of progress towards implementing the national adaptation plan • an adaptation

reporting plan



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
Notes

A targeted adaptation reporting power could start with voluntary reporting in the first year, and require compulsory reporting in
subsequent years.
