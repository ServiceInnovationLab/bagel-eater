Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Jane Young






Reference no: 10245


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 I strongly support the creation of a Zero Carbon Act. Ideally we would be able to wait until the Climate Change Commission advises on
 a specific target, but we have already delayed taking meaningful action for far too long. We must act now.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived

 gases
 Notes
 There needs to be immediate, steep cuts to methane emissions in order to buy us some time to deal with the long term problem of

 CO2 and NO2 emissions, and for the Climate Commission to determine what stabilised levels of methane should be. The agricultural
 industry has to start taking responsibility for its emissions.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 We need to reduce our gross emissions â€“ and of course, plant lots of trees. We shouldn't rely on international credits, which, even if

 they can be certified not to be of the shonky variety, still do nothing to reduce our own emissions.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 Within specified guidelines, but with very little provision for a downward movement.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Good idea not to have the length the same as the electoral cycle.



 Clause

 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

 its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Knowledge of innovation and technology developments is essential so that the Commission can give evidence-based advice on
future directions.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
We need regular climate risk assessments and an adaptation programme. There needs to be consistent expectations placed on

councils when it comes to dealing with climate change risks.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

Customers should have the right to know how financial institutions, insurance companies etc are exposed to climate change risks.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
The RMA should be amended so that climate change impacts are considered whenever a consents decision is made under the act.

There should be clear, consistent guidelines determining that negative impacts on the climate will have a greater weighting than
claimed positive effects on the economy.
