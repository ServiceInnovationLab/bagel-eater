Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Hilary Webb








Reference no: 12834

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 As I understand and support this choice, a legislative committment will be protected from shorter term political interference and
 changes in committment. The emissions budgets enable some flexibility when so much can change in 32 years, without undermining

 the fixed committment.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes
 The long-lived stock gases are the primary concern. NZ's short-lived flow gas profile is unique and I believe agriculture will rise to the

 challenge.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 I have reservations about planting lots of plantation forestry and would prefer to see permanent forest, preferably native forest.
 Despite the lower sequestration rates, it is genuine carbon capture, with potential for a more diverse range of insitu industries than
 just producing wood for the commodity market (or to be burnt for fuel).



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Notes

 I'd like to be able to increase the short-lived gas target if technological solutions pop up.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Fantastic mechanism



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes
 allows for some flexibility and ensures tradeoffs are addressed across the 3rd & subsequent budgets



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
Notes




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Nice balance of economic and sustainability considerations.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

Accountability is important, and ensures committment



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

I wonder if Maori would be comforable making committemnts on behalf of future generations?



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Accountability is important



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Innovation will be a huge part of sucess, but may not be required for the CCC




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
So - my understanding is this function would provide a consistent national approach to issues like coastal erosion that individual TLA's

have been facing and setting preceedents on an ad hoc basis. Ths would provide stability and assurance for those affected and for
insurers.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes - because addressing climate change in policy and planning has been beyond the brief of TLAs so this would be a start to

quantifying the risks.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
1. I am excited about the potential for NZ to develop and export climate change technologies to late adopters - huge potential to

transform NZ into a knowledge economy. Imagine selling our livestock methane vaccines to the US â€“ huge return on investment!
Develop an electric car/tractor industry here, subsidise if you have to, and stop all mass imports of second hand cars. 2. I have
reservations about land use change (assuming this means pastoral farming to forestry) as a mechanism for addressing climate

change for the following reasons: a. There is time to address methane levels, and a genuine will by farmers to address climate
change. Farmers experience the effects of climate change every day, every year. They need to be a key part of finding a solution,

rather than having it imposed on them as land use change. b. The dairy industry will do, and is already proactively doing, what is has
to in order to remain in business. This drive to survive will foster innovation. c. We need to preserve the option to be competitive in

future land-based industries. Imagine, for instance, a world that demands llama or alpaca fibre, possum fur or wool instead of
synthetic fibres. New Zealand is already good at these small-scale industries, so it would be a backward step to lose this capacity

through land use change. d. Climate change may create opportunities for NZ's temperate climate to provide more food to the world
through horticulture. Land use change may restrict this option and push up the price of arable land. 3. I have concerns about the
impacts on low-income households, especially rural poor: a. Low-income families should receive a subsidy for electric cars & home

insulation (already partially done through previous home insulation initiatives). b. Rural (lifestyle & urban too if they wish) households
need the option to be self-sufficient rather than be forced to rely on electricity or gas (expensive and often not available in rural areas)

so they can stay healthy and warm during winter power cuts, for instance. Innovative small scale technologies such as solar panels
and wind mills could be subsidised on proof of removal of log burners or diesel generators. Thank you for the opportunity to submit

onthis imprtant matter
