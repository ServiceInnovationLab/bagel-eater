Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Sarah Woodfield








Reference no: 11847

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 This Act needs to be as specific as possible and set ambitious goals.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 This is urgent and important. We need to set an ambitious goal to aim for, we can do it if we try.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 We need to set a good example, and make sure our jurisdiction covers our activities. Emissions reductions from overseas are much
 more open to uncertainty.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 I can't imagine any possible circumstances that would necessitate a change




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Again, certainty is key in this sort of document. The more certainty the more people and industries can just get on and do it.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes
 I think it should be able to be changed, but only in a stronger direction. That it, to make it more ambitious, and get to Carbon Zero
 sooner than 2050.




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No
 Notes

 Certainty is key.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

We need to include mitigation factors particularly in our aid budgets across the pacific. Emission reduction is less important, and we in
NZ can do more than our share to reduce theoretical requirements for poor Island nations where emissions are already very low.

Further reduction from an already low base makes much less sense than NZ reducing as we are starting from such a high per person
emission rate.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Climate commission should be decision making.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

Particularly in our aid budgets, these need to be transparent, and recipients of Aid need to be targeted to those in need.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

We need to be leading the way in transparency and engagement, everyone needs to do their part.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
This is urgent and important. The science is clear and we need to get going with this. Certainty and transparency are key, and we

need to make sure this plan can not be watered down by future governments trying to win votes. I support the most ambitious target
of reducing total greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050. I also support taking a science-based approach to ensure our efforts to

reduce emissions are as impactful as possible: we should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases
to sustainable levels. This target should be reached by reducing our own emissions and not by using international carbon credits. At
the moment we are borrowing from the future of upcoming generations. We need to get on with this ourselves.
