Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill












Reference no: 9573


Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 Man made climate change & the Science is UNPROVEN. No action needs to be or should be taken. No emission targets regulated will
 make any difference to the worlds climate which will change naturally through many other factors outside of mans control, so this is a

 waste of time, money, expense & any BS tax collected as a consequence should be put to better use, ie Healthcare. This
 survey/submission is also BS as there is no option for the realists to state that this contrivance about man being responsible for the
 changing weather is all a gross political manipulation.

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Perhaps look at the realistic truth and not the manipulated, brainwashed self interested scientists that incidentally do not form 97%
consensus agreement. More manipulated media hyped BS



Clause

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

How you can be an expert on something that is untruthful?



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes

What? And waste even more precious financial resources on an issue that won’t be stopped by the worlds population. No more gravy
trains needed. This country is already stuffed with this climate change BS rehetoric, and we don’t need any more regulatory BS
controlling groups/committees or otherwise to bleed the average consumer or resident dry of their wealth (what little they have left

after this Government is finished with them)
