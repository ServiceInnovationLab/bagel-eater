Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Shari, Shari Jayne Nevalagi (Neva-Moffitt








Reference no: 10852

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 The Government need'd to have a policy made for the displacement of Pasifika people due to climat change



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes
 Calling out neoliberal business who cause the most emissions. Leave fossil fuels in the ground.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 Focus on what we do in N.Z first. Get that tight, solid & running well then model what we do to the rest of the world.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Yes keep it real. Treat it as a living document



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Yes but what is the reality here? Can this be done? Or is it just a pipe dream?



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes

 That is a tricky one. If National get's back in, in 2020 I would say no because I do not trust them. I would say yes if the Government
 was being lead by the Green Party. I sit on the fence with Labour. I do not have full faith in them to keep their word here.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes

 If it was the current government then yes. If it was a National lead government then I would say no. They put profit before planet &
 people



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes

 Yes but the Green Party is lacking the human element & that is our Pasifika people. People like me. Our voices are not being heard
 yet we & our lands are majorly affected by climate change yet we contribute the least amount to this serious issue
Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
It's imperative other wise our planet will die & so will we




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
You need to work more closely with the Pasifika community. Not just let Labour do that. I have watched Hon Aupito William Sio & Hon

Dr Megan Woods battle it out over climate change & the affects on Pasifika people. I agree with Hon Aupitio "there are no job's on a
dead planet". Sadly Hon Dr Megan was fixated on not making changes that would leave people jobless. I believe that this is a fine line

to walk on. Our Pasifika people have already lost vital parts of our lands, food supply & income due to climate change.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Please don't leave out Pasifika people with ecological wisdom



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes & it needs to have the human element added to it which is currently missing "Pasifkia People Displaced by Climate Change".



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
For the most part



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Please stop leaving Pasifika people out of these important conversations. I am Niuean. In 2004 cyclone Heta made a mess of the
Pacific & my beautiful Island hasn't been the same since. When I wen't home last year I was very sad to learn that my Island had not

produced a solid crop of mangoes in 5 years. This is due to cyclones & weather bombs going through in the blossom season. What
happens is the weather ruins all the blossoms & blows them off the trees. That is why my Island no longer produces mangoes. This

hurts me because they used to be plentiful. The village of Vaiea in Niue has become home to people displaced by climate change
who come from Tokelau. What the Niue Government say's about this situation & what I heard from my Niuean family & saw in the

village was very different. The holding period in Niue for people from Tokelau is 5 years before they are able to get N.Z citizenship. I
believe this situation needs to be urgently looked at. It seams quite unjust. Whilst I might not be loosing my whenua yet it will happen
one day. I would like to see major changes so that this doesn't happen. Pasifika people are heart speakers, we have ecological

wisdom that has been passed down over the years. Please stop shutting us out from these conversations. We contribute the least
yet we suffer the most. Planet & People before profit. There are no job's on a dead planet.
