Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Troy Titheridge





Reference no: 137

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Carbon Dioxide - Reducing net carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2050
 Notes




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 This is an ambitious and bold target. And it is important for Government to be ambitious and be committed to attempt to reduce

 emissions as much as possible.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 It is important for the Government and Commission to be mindful that change world circumstances financially, technologically,
scientifically, climatically, socially may impact the target for benefit or for worse.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
Work with the United Nations and the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) to provide counsel for New Zealand to meet

its targets.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

Yes, having a Commission to monitor the Government ensures that goals are being met and are not be avoided. It also allows the
Government to be held accountable as the Commission can say what needs to be done, and if not then there will be consequences.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
I sit on the fence on the NZ ETS, whilst trading our emissions has been the only option thus far, I think we should not be spending

the money on credits for other overseas countries to pollute, we should be spending the money on New Zealand emissions
reduction initiatives.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes, New Zealands contribution to the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) has one lead author from New Zealand - Dr.
Bronwyn Hayward. There are other experts who should be involved as well such as Dr. Kennedy Graham, Fmr Green Party MP. The

proposed expertise should also include a student representative as they are the future generation that will be living in 2050.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes
Carbon emissions and climate change are inter-related.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Yes, but coastal communities (Dunedin, Westport/Granity) are being impacted as well. We need to think about future planning and

resilience such as should coastal communities relocate, what will happen if insurance providers dont pay out as the home owners
knew the risk of the location, should we invest in flood mitigation schemes and sea walls etc.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes, ensuring that all stakeholders of the community can contribute and share their thoughts is important.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

The plan should involve the stopping of importing second hand cars from Japan. Second hand car dealers are still importing cars from
the 90's and selling them to New Zealand buyers. If we are to achieve the targets, banning the import and sale of passenger cars to

New Zealand that are a certain age must be enacted. There should be guidelines that state for example that no car older than
2005(?) should be imported into New Zealand for sale as a passenger vehicle. In addition to this, providing incentives and tax breaks
for car dealerships that make a commitment to import 40% of cars are electric vehicles by 2025 will reduce carbon emissions to

reach the 2050 targets, gradually increasing the 45% to 60% by 2050.
