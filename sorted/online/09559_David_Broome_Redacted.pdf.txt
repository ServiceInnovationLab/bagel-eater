Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Reference no: 9559

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes

 The danger of setting a target in legislation now is that it will reflect short-lived climate pollutants, such as methane, that recent
 science shows will overstate its Global Warming Potential as “CO2-equivalent” emissions. The conventional New Zealand stocktake is
 heavily skewed towards methane from primary land use when expressed as “CO2-equivalent” emissions. A recent study (see

 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-018-0026-8) co-authored by VUW's Professor Frame and colleagues from Oxford University
 and the University of Reading as well as Norway's Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research, exaggerated the long-

 term effects of methane on the climate. CO2 is a stock pollutant that accumulates in the atmosphere whereas methane is a flow
 pollutant, which disappears about a decade after its emissions occur. Consequently, as this is new science that could reshape the
 New Zealand profile, it is better to have the net zero target but leave it to the Commission to advise Government on the specific

 target.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Carbon Dioxide - Reducing net carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2050
 Notes

 CO2 should be the target gas given it accumulates and by targeting this one gas other solutions will likely arise to flow emissions.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Notes
 The concept of CO2-e emissions is deeply embedded in climate policy despite its weaknesses. Before any Budget can be

 established, there must be a fundamental reassessment of the inventory in light of stock and flow climate pollutants.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

mitigation'' by Myles R. Allen, Keith P. Shine, Jan S. Fuglestvedt, Richard J. Millar, Michelle Cain, David J. Frame & Adrian H. Macey.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
This needs a whole of government approach.
