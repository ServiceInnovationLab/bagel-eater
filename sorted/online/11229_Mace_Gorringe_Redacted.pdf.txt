Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Mace Gorringe






Reference no: 11229


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 Measurability is vital. Rigorous, scientific analysis is improving rapidly (see the blossoming green finance sphere for examples of the
 verification and classification that's possible and increasingly standardised nowadays).



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes
 It's a global problem that needs a global solution, and we should give and take in terms of emissions and reductions.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 Only changes should be by bringing the date sooner or by adding additional requirements as science develops.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 Again - measurability and accountability are vital. Reporting standards are developing quickly (see the Climate Bond Initiative and its
 Climate Bond Standard, for example, and the assurance industry that is springing up around green finance). The government can
 lead the way in showing how sustainability reporting can work (which can in future become mandatory for public-reporting entities

 more generally).



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No
 Notes
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

While I agree with the considerations proposed, I would like to see economic considerations expanded to explicitly include reference
to access to international capital markets and how the decision may affect inward investment in green finance in New Zealand.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Work with financiers and the capital markets. The transformative projects that are required will need funding - so involving these

decision makers at the outset will help NZ compete for international capital (pensions funds, sovereign wealth funds, industry bodies,
etc).



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes - should also be an obligation (perhaps just a soft one) to engage with those parties providing measurement, assurance,
verification, certification, etc within the capital markets.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No
Notes

It is critical that the Climate Change Commission also includes commissioners with experience in capital markets. Someone with
extensive global investment banking, fund management or similar experience.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes

Reducing emissions is only part of the problem. Building resilience to change is important too.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
