Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Rebecca Anne Randerson









Reference no: 11685

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 Reforestation, horticultural planting and improved soil health (which will absorb some of New Zealand’s carbon dioxide emissions),
 can be part of meeting our domestic net zero emissions target. Main focus must be rapidly reducing NZ’s greenhouse gas emissions
 - all gases, all sectors. NZ (businesses, iwi, communities, whānau, households, and all sectors including the health sector) needs

 certainty to act decisively now.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 Unless it they get zero carbon earlier than 2050 - the earlier the better



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Three 5-year emissions budgets covering the next 15 years, with our “legislated net zero emissions by 2040 target”, gives the

 certainty needed for action and investment now.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes

 The last budget should be able to be reduced if needed to respond to emerging international evidence. The Zero Carbon Act should
 also permit any Government to act so NZ can emit less than budgeted



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
Notes




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes
For business certainty reasons this needs to be as firm as possible. The Zero Carbon Act must require the Government to respond

by publishing plans to stay within budget as rapidly as feasible within a set time limit that is certainly less than 12 months.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Equity / fairness within Aotearoa/NZ Treaty of Waitangi obligations. Health equity is essential in planning and monitoring . The
substantial co-benefits to health from well-designed reduction and mitigation must be considered. Sustainable economic

opportunities and technology relevant to climate change, to grow a fairer, just, sustainable Aotearoa-NZ. The Government must work
in Te Tiriti partnership, and with NZ’s most vulnerable communities (those already disadvantaged and those working in high-

emissions industries), to create a hopeful, fairer future.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Commission must set NZ’s Emissions Budgets independently from whatever government is in power. The Commission can also
advise how NZ stays within these budgets, how NZ can best adapt to climate change, and monitor progress on NZ’s emissions
reductions




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
The Commission should advise the Government on ETS policy settings so that New Zealand emits within budget




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes
On top of those listed, there are a number of essential areas that must be added - health expertise amongst Commissioners and

staffing is needed too. - expertise in achieving social change is also important. It is also essential that the Commission is founded on
partnership with tāngata whenua and upholds obligations under Te Tiriti o Waitangi. It is important that vested interests, are not part

of the Commission, particularly those with a financial interest in maintaining the health-harming status quo



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
Adaptation needs to be a separate work stream, to avoid distraction from the top priority of mitigation
Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

I support the following adaptation provisions :   a national climate change risk assessment   a national climate adaptation plan  a
regular review of progress towards implementing the national adaptation plan  an adaptation reporting plan  Mitigation and

adaptation are often deeply interlinked - so often mitigation and adaptation can be addressed together in the same policy (e.g.
housing). But care must be taken in designing adaptation policies to ensure that climate-damaging emissions are not increased. A
health adaptation plan must be put in place that covers both health sector adaptation and health-protecting adaptation in other

sectors.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Farming emissions esp methane should be included as part of all greenhouse gases
