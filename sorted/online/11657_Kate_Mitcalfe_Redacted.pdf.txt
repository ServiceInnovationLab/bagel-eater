Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Kate Mitcalfe









Reference no: 11657

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes
 This is a critical issue. We cannot afford to delay any longer.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 An ambitious target will create new opportunities in technology and innovation. We need to face up to the long term effects of our

 carbon emissions and act now.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 We have relied heavily on offshore carbon units, which has provided other countries with the incentive to innovate and become global
 leaders. As well as an environmental advantage, it also provides them with a strong economic benefit. It is time we invested locally to

 offset our emissions - this would support local business innovation and also mean that we are taking responsibility for our own
 greenhouse gas pollution.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Notes
 It would need to be strictly limited to unforeseen and significant events. This is a critical issue and we need to get on with it. We must

 take strong climate action now.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 I like the decision to use 5 year budgets (rather than 6) to shift it off the electoral cycle - this issue is bigger than party politics.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes
 Allowing flexibility ensures we can address any changes that may be required in order to reduce emissions.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes

 Exceptional circumstances would needs to be well defined (for example, unforeseen, significant events such as natural disasters
would constitute exceptional circumstances).




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
All sectors must be included (including agriculture).



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
We need to have a clear and coordinated adaption plan. The Zero Carbon Bill could serve as a vehicle for this but it should not detract
from the more critical objective of reducing greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
I have three children (7, 11, 13) - this is a critical issue for us, them and future generations, not to mention the other species with
which we share this planet. Please be ambitious and act now. Kia kaha, kia maia, kia manawanui - Kate Mitcalfe
