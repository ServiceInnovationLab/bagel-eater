Reference no: 10175


Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Carbon Dioxide - Reducing net carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2050
 Notes

 CO2 is the big problem lets concentrate on that while we get some good science around the question of Methane.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 Selling carbon units is good revenue but does absolutely nothing to solve global co2 levels.Another entity buys carbon credits to
 offset their emissions then carries on pouring co2 into the atmosphere. Carbon credits are ridiculous if you're serious about global

 warming. Another scam.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 We're entering unknown territory. Are we being realistic in our targets. Not a good idea to set things in concrete only to find they are
 unachievable



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 A budget is a budget, allows the flexibility to change if targets achieved/not achieved. Care will be needed when budget levels set -

 has to be realistic



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes
 Again- there is a need to be realistic



 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

 Position
Yes

Notes
need to ensure realistic goals are set




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Realistic values. Include all the science, not just the negative stuff. No consideration is being made for the uptake and storage of

Carbon in the soil/pasture/vegetation/shelter belts? All of these things have a huge influence. After all it is what the cows eat that
produces the Methane, how does the Carbon get into the cow so it can come out. Very Basic science = carbon cycle. Current view is

all one sided.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Cant be left up to government need sound independent advise from a range of experts



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes

Personally think the ETS is a scam -we shouldn't be involved Thin air = commodity, come on!!



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

We need to get all the data in front of us before making decisions. Listen to the unbiased scientific research, not the science pro
ported by those with a vested interest.
