Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Matthew Thredgold








Reference no: 10337

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 2050 is too far into the future. We should be planning for 2020, 2025 and 2030.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Carbon Dioxide - Reducing net carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2050

 Notes
 And setting targets for other greenhouse forcing gases (it's not just about carbon dioxide). There should be methane and particulate
 pollution targets as well, with particulate pollution targets set very low since there are some very negative health outcomes to do with

 particulate pollution.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 The new forestry plantings is an accounting trick. How forestry products are used is important too. If forestry waste or trees are
 harvested to be burned then the effects (such as black carbon and methane emissions) must be included in the accounting.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 But only to be brought in to sooner. Not allowed to be missed.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 But they should be aggressive, and not waste time.



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
 "Social implications such as fuel poverty" is used as an excuse to maintain the status quo of laissez-faire domestic wood burning,

 which is something that needs to be banned in residential areas. The externalities forced onto other people and the community
 (each wood burner costs the community thousands each year) are much larger than the supposed benefits of the person burning.
 Full cost accounting would see wood burning banned in residential areas, as well as being banned on health and justice grounds,

 and there is a need to rein in wood burning for climate reasons.



 Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

You need to work with the whole community, because everyone in the whole community needs to change. Domestic wood burning
needs to be banned.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Climate and environmental science should be the first on the list. Atmospheric physicists and chemists as well. You also need public

health expertise for particulate pollution health effects.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
There is a link between domestic wood burning and climate forcing. Here is a summary :

https://woodsmokepollution.org/climate.html and here are the source peer reviewed documents -
https://woodsmokepollution.org/references.html#environment-and-climate-references The Chief Scientist should write a report to

summarise the climate and health effects of wood burning. There is too little knowledge of this area of science at all levels of
government. Not addressing wood burning on climate change, means any plan would be incomplete.
