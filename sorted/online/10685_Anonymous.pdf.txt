Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill












Reference no: 10685


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 A target for net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 should be in the Act. The emissions from transport, industrial activity, agriculture, and

 all other sources should be included in the target. Even ‘short-lived’ gasses can have a huge effect on our climate and need to be
 reduced.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 Unless it is to achieve an even tougher target, if science proves this is necessary.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 The emissions budgets should not be able to become election campaign issues.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
 Notes
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

But these issues must not used as an excuse to weaken overall targets.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
Emissions budgets should be at least as important as fiscal budgets, and the Government should set plans to achieve them.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
You need to work with industry as well as stakeholder NGOs and the community, but industry should not be outstrip the rights of

ordinary NZer's to live in a country that meets its climate obligations



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

An independent Climate Change Commission of experts should monitor emissions and give advice to keep New Zealand on-track for
its emissions reduction goals.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

The act should also specifically consider those most vulnerable to climate change impacts, such as our pacific island neighbours, for
them the focus should be on adaption.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
This is our chance to do what is necessary to limit the impacts of climate change, please be bold in setting these targets. We know it

will require changes in how we live and how industry operates, but it is better to be world leaders in these changes than straggling
behind. There will always be communities more affected by strong targets, but this cannot be an excuse, alternatively the focus

should be to help those more affected to adapt to a low carbon economy. Our countries small size is no excuse, our emissions per
capita are in the top 10 countries in the world. We are surrounded by ocean and we will strongly feel the impacts of warming ocean
temperatures and rising sea levels. The act should also consider those most vulnerable to climate change impacts, such as our

pacific island neighbours, for them the focus should be on adaption. If New Zealand won’t do it, who will? Please act now to protect
our oceans, our forests and our wildlife. Our children will thank us for it.
