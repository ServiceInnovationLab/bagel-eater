Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Stephen Christie









Reference no: 143

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes

 Common sense. No target required.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 Carry on without Government involvement. CO2 is plant food and greening the earth.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Notes
 Don't do anything.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 So it can be scrapped when people realise it is not a concern.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes
 Yes, so it can be scrapped by any rational government.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 To scrap it when common sense is achieved.



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
 Scrap the whole thing.



 Clause

 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Position
 No

 Notes
Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
Sceptics. The most important thing is to stop listening to the biased and following models that are just wrong.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Notes

Disbanding itself and the ETS scheme.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No
Notes

No socialists. That would fix it.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
No

Notes
Should not exist.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Please get some balanced views. If everyone involved is already sold on CAGW (now called Climate Change) then what is the point. Is
there any sceptis involved?
