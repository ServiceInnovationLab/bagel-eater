Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

David John Evans






Reference no: 9719


Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 Zero carbon by 2050 is too late, the time frame should be “by 2040”. Evidence is growing that 2 degrees of warming is untenable so
 we must act quickly to limit warming to no more than 1.5 degrees.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 The time frame should be “by 2040”, rather than 2050. It is essential that we differentiate between short-lived and long-lived gases.
 We also need to differentiate between biological methane emissions and the fugitive emissions of fossil methane from oil production.

 Reducing short-lived gases, specifically methane and nitrous oxide from agriculture, should begin by 2020 while research is
 undertaken to determine if there is a sustainable level. Until that is known the target should be net zero for all greenhouse gases by

 2040.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 I do not support the purchase of credits from overseas as this is susceptible to misuse, as has been seen in the past decade.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes

 I believe the target should only be allowed to be brought forward, if circumstances require or permit. The situation is too dire to allow
 the possibility of delay.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 The bill should require that budgets are binding on the government.




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 This should be permitted only to make the target more ambitious. To allow budgets to be altered due to economic circumstances
 may lead to backsliding on an issue that requires the utmost urgency.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

This should be permitted only to make the target more ambitious. We are facing an existential threat rivalled only by nuclear war, no
economic circumstances are exceptional enough to require relaxing a target.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Budgets must be set with the target of net zero emissions by 2040 fully in mind and economic considerations must not be used to
delay action now to the extent that unrealistic action is required further down the track. Drastic changes to how our economy

functions will be required. Emissions reductions must take priority over economic growth as the two are almost certainly
incompatible.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes

There should be no possibility of delaying action.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

All strata of society should be considered as well as future generations so that all changes are fair and equitable. Drastic changes to
how our economy functions will be required. Emissions reductions must take priority over economic growth as the two are almost

certainly incompatible.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

A balance needs to be struck between a body that commands respect from the government, but does not constrain its decision
making ability so much that the government legislates it out of existence. People with great mana must be recruited for the

Commission to ensure it can endure political challenges.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

I prefer a carbon tax to the ETS, but if the ETS remains the Commission should advise the government on policy settings for the ETS.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
People with great mana must be recruited for the Commission to ensure it can endure political challenges.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
I am concerned that the government will do nothing while the Commission deliberates. There should be strict and urgent time frames

for all stages of the process and very limited opportunity for achieving very little.
