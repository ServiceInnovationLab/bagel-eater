Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Climate change is driven by the human population; we MUST stop the inexorable growth in population in NZ and worlwide and set an
example. Population growth is encouraged by vested interests in "Big Business" that want ever expanding markets for their products
and services, as well as other drivers such as religous ideologies. We must stop population growth NOW; in NZ it is largely driven by

emigration and must stop.
