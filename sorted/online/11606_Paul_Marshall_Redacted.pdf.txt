Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

This virtue signalling nonsense puts a handbrake on our economy for no measurable effect. Signing up for this is causing economic
treason to the tax payers of New Zealand and those reponsible should join SImon Upton (signed us up to the 1992 protocols) to a

stint breaking rocks at her majesties pleasure.
