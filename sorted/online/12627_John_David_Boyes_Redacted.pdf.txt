Reference no: 12627

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 Net zeto emissions by 2040



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes

 Should be yearly for zero by 2040



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Notes
 Stupid question



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Another stupid question



 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
IPCC

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
It can be ignored in the usual manner



Clause

(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
Should advise the government to have no part of it,



Clause

Position
No

Notes

Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

Fir heavens sake



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Annual mandatory targets should b e established for carbon emissions, with measures for correcting and penalising missed targets.

The emissions target should be zero by 2040 and continuing to zero or less by 2050. In comparison with other economies which
seem to be being used as benchmarks New Zealand has a relatively easy task. Thus there is no need to put things off to 2050,
regardless whether 2050 is or is not a very plausible target for other countries. Without a mandatory annual plan a long term target

such as 2040 has little meaning, even if such a target is one of the points on the implied curve. Without a mandatory annual plan
sectors which may have to be reduced or eliminated will experience no pressure to take any action. This is true enough for any

activity, but we are unfortunate in having a small number of large rather inflexibly established players. For such there is a clear
advantage in looting their sectors in advance of a long term problem which will not go away, while influencing governments to direct

attention elsewhere. A carbon budgeting system should be established with no convertibility between money and carbon, in effect a
parallel currency. If trading between carbon and money is allowed it is naive to think that the intelligent and unscrupulous people in

the financial sector will not run rings around conflicted and malleable politicians. It is unfortunate that our national culture has become
totally fiscalised, so that it is difficult to imagine any other mechanism that the public would understand. In some rather pedantic
sense, trading could take place, but only in the same sense that at present some people may think it worthwhile to, for example,

commit crimes. So missed targets might for example involve monetary fines of more than profits made. The basic supply for a carbon
currency would in effect be related to the emission targets. This raises some interesting possibilities. An example is currency

disappearing if not used, which is a quite conventional idea. Another would be use of the currency to improve people's standard of
living - for example as a reward to allow a non-consuming improved lifestyle such as fewer working hours. It is almost an insult to the

victims of economic policies of the recent past to discuss concerns about household incomes. New Zealand has grotesque income
inequality, which if left unaddressed make any changes involving emissions changes a minor factor in the general misery. On the
positive side, the available task of rebuilding a balanced economy can be used to create employment and to restore standards of

living. As regards our international role it is often supposed, in effect, that New Zealand is so small it can hope to operate unnoticed,
or that our image is so good that we can get away with anything. However, any discussion of carbon emissions which does not

acknowledge that the problem is linked to the disaster of global overpopulation is irresponsible. Purely in terms of self interest, even if
New Zealand transited to zero or even negative emissions we still have much the same serious problem. Certainly, we could feel

virtuous and have fewer cars, less pointless work, better food and housing and so on as a consequence of a zero carbon economy,
but extreme climatic events will still be a rolling disaster. Just how overpopulation can be addressed may not be immediately obvious

but is has to be considered. There is even the possibility of providing a model for other countries, though that might be laughable at
present. Targets for population decrease in New Zealand, involving if necessary resources to address the necessary demographic
changes, could be set. Equally, New Zealand could do much more to counteract pressures to increase population worldwide. This

may seem to be none of our business, but other governments have no scruples about increasing carbon emissions by encouraging
growth and consumption outside their own countries.
