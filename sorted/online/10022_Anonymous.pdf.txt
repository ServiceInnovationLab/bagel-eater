Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 10022

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 Emmisions and carbon adsorption ofset are not well studied otta to early to enforce crude science like the p house blunder



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes
 Non of the above the science and research is to crude for enforce at this stage




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 No target should be set until the science of emmisions and adsorption are fully understood and not based on extrapolation from very
 crude bias research



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Notes
 The bill should not be past the science and methodology fit testing is at best crude and needs further unbias I investigation




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 No
 Notes




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes

 The bill should not pass the research is to crude and bias



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes
 No bill that is based on scientific research should be passed until seriously scrutinized by the scientific community




 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Notes
 No commission should be appointed until full investigation, bias and non bias had taken place. There is not enough evidence to

 properly understand all components of emissions and carbon adsorption in nz



 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Notes

 No carbon bill should pass that is not seriously scrutinised by the scientific communities bias and non bias
Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
Green party of nz SHOULD NOT BE POLITICIANS they should be logical right minded scientists with bias and non bias research from

multiple sources science is not political proper science is seriously scrutinized from many sources and all aspects of the subject mist
ne addressed before any action is taken. At the moment the science around emmisions is portrayed incorrectly as is the research

with missing components of the wider picture .



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

The monitoring is as well undetstood as the actual sources of emmisions the science for monitoring is far to crude to be considered
as evidence



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Notes
The climate change commision is a disgraceful waste of government resource




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
No absolutely not There is not enough research or scientist's to truely understand that this subject is not yet ready to be introduced

into any kind of reform



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
The question is as ridiculous as it sounds




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
It is a waste of time/ government funding



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
No

Notes
Another sponge for government funding absolute waste of money



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

The zero carbon emissions bill should be scrapped immediately for the good of New Zealand. There is not enough scientific
evidence not enough research to truly understand it is too early to understand emissions and emissions absorption in New Zealand

Evidence from environmental agencies supporting the carbon emissions bill shows clearly that the scientific research is far too crude
to be put into any type of political reform please check the evidence used by the environmental agencies pushing this bill
