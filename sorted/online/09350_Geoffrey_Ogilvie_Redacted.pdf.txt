Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Geoff, Arden Hybrid Tours (Geoffrey Ogilvie)









Reference no: 9350

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes

 I appreciate what the Zero Carbon Bill is trying to achieve. From my information (Freely available on the web) we are already too late to
 prevent the 6th Mass Extinction. The best thing individuals can do is accept the inevitable and live Hospice Life of Love, Compassion
 and Peace. With the melting of Artic Ice on schedule within the time frame now to 2019 the darkened sea feedback loop guarantees

 another 1.2C above the already 1 C increase achieved since 1990.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Notes
 The unknown amount of trapped Greenhouse Gasses (Notably Methane) under the artic Ice and the permafrost regions of the
 Northern Continents amount to an abrupt atmospheric temp increase of up to 5C on top of the 2.2 C already achieved (2019). It is

 entirely possible that all oxygen requiring animals, birds and fish will die when the Oxygen in the atmosphere drops below 19%.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Notes
 Too little Too Late. Best to enter the world Hospice Stage.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Notes
 See above comments



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Notes
 See above comments



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes
 See above comments



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Notes
 See above comments



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes

 See above comments



 Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Notes
Too late. First feedback loop already licked in with Artic Ice Mett 2018-2019




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Hospice Planet Earth Phase needs activating to provide citizens with a dignified departure from the planet.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Notes

Scrap the ETS. It has proven by 60% increase in Greenhouse Gasses to have failed spectacularly. Any scheme based on the
Paradigm that got us into this mess as a species is doomed to fail.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
Too little too late and by the wrong groups. Government, Business and Main Stream Media are criminally liable for the 6th Mass

Extinction. But that is of little comfort from the outcome that is already arrived.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
See above results



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
Too little too late. No attempt made by Government , Business, or Main Stream Media to inform the worlds' humans of the

catastrophe of Mass Extinction and how to adapt to this reality.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes
See above




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Its too late for comments other than to say it is well overdue for individuals to accept the reality of the 6th Mass Extinction and live

their remaining lives with Love, Peace and purpose towards Nature.
