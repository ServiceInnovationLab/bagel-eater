Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill






Reference no: 12445

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes




 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 I support most ambitious, clearest, science-based target. We need to reduce all greenhouse gases, including methane. Applying two

 baskets thinking to our 2050 target, the most ambitious and impactful approach would be to achieve negative long-lived gas
 emissions, while reducing short-lived gas emissions to sustainable levels. Getting to this point would mean that New Zealand is

 contributing to global cooling.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 The clearest approach is a “firewall” which separates international contributions from our domestic Zero Carbon Act targets. This
 would not stop New Zealand from purchasing international carbon credits as an additional contribution to global mitigation efforts.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Notes
 The 2050 target should only be revised in exceptional circumstances. The purpose of the Zero Carbon Act is to provide

 accountability, certainty and flexibility. It will provide accountability and certainty by setting clear, legally-binding emission reduction
 targets. It will retain flexibility by permitting different governments to use different policies to meet these targets, in response to
 changing circumstances and new technology.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 No. Budgets should only be revised in exceptional circumstances. It is not appropriate for a new government to “have a say” on an
 upcoming budget which has already been set. This would create too much uncertainty and instability. What a new government can
 do is introduce different policies to meet the upcoming target




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Notes
 Under exceptional circumstances, yes. For example, it might be appropriate to change an upcoming budget after an extreme natural
 disaster (such as a major earthquake). Revising a budget in this situation would not mean changing the long-term 2050 target. To

 provide maximum certainty and accountability, budgets should not be revised unless the circumstances are exceptional
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Notes
I generally agree with the proposed list of considerations to take into account when setting emission budgets: scientific knowledge

about climate change technology relevant to climate change economic circumstances and, in particular, the likely impact of the
decision on the economy and the competitiveness of particular sectors of the economy fiscal circumstances and, in particular, the

likely impact of the decision on taxation, public spending and public borrowing social circumstances and, in particular, the likely
impact of the decision on fuel poverty energy policy and, in particular, the likely impact of the decision on energy supplies and the

carbon and energy intensity of the economy the government’s obligations under the Treaty of Waitangi the three government
objectives for climate change policy: sustainable economy, global and local leadership and creating a just and inclusive society



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes
This time frame should be 6 months after an emission budget has been set.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable,
and reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

The Commission should not be a decision-making body



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

The commission should not make final decisions. Otherwise it risks being a compromised watchdog.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

I generally agree with the proposed list of expertise which should be collectively held by the Climate Commission: climate change
policy (including emissions trading) resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour markets and distribution) te

Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning, insurance and local government risk management engineering

and/or infrastructure community engagement and communications. public health



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
