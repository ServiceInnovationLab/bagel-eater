Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Mary Sewell








Reference no: 11726

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 Target needs to be included in legislation so it is not subject to the winds of politics.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 We need a bold vision, and work to achieve this through research and innovation, particularly in the agricultural sector.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes
 With the bold plan we may need initially to meet targets use international credits. But these must be above board and verifiable. This

 also provides a way for small countries to assist each other to achieve their climate goals.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 Though perhaps the 5-year targets could be adjusted to allow for progress to be slowed due to earthquakes or other natural
 disasters.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Required for planning by business, farmers and the transportation sector.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 But I qualify by saying if they were going be more ambitious and leading to faster emissions reduction I would be OK with that, but not
 if they were to going to be less ambitious, slowing down progress.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
Notes

As long as the exceptional circumstances were exceptional - natural disaster or similar unforeseen event when setting target (e.g.
war, financial crisis).




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
Clear short-term targets are needed to hit the long-term goal.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The fishing and aquaculture industry must also be part of the consultation as high CO2 also results in ocean acidification which

affects them.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

But with the awareness that climate change is also an issue for the oceans so have that expertise covered by one of the members.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
We should all be helping each other to achieve the bold targets that the bill sets. We are all in this together.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

The Government is to be commended for taking this much needed step to address the importance of climate change. Be bold in the
target goal and work towards that through innovation - e.g. blue carbon, growing seaweeds etc. Win-win as provide economic

benefits at the same time and as a country we can produce "premium" agricultural, horticultural and aquaculture products using the
"Zero Carbon" approach in branding.
