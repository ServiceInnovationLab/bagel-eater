Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Only in extreme circumstances, for example bringing the date forward in response to accelerating climate change.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 Only in exceptional circumstances, ie not to be expected, otherwise it would be destabilising in relation to longer-term planning.



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The Government will need to work alongside other countries embracing a similar approach to climate change, maintaining a dialogue
on the latest scientific and technological advances, and any new and unforeseen impacts of climate change. The Government will

obviously need to work with financial institutions to ensure that they are geared for change, and that the required funding can be
made available without damaging the economy. The Government needs to encourage, and keep informed, regarding relevant and

applicable research from NZ research institutes, universities and businesses. The Goverment will need to maintain a dialogue with
the transport and power industries in regard to what is possible in regard to minimising emissions, and what change is required to

achieve it. In relation to transport, better provision of good, low-emission (eg electric) public transport would appear to be the way to
go. The Government also needs to provide support to those involved in industries which are likely to be particularly challenged by the
need to change, for example, farmers and those in the mining industry. The Government needs to talk to and obtain buy in from the

general population, by providing leadership and showing the benefits of the changes for them, both in the long term and short term.
This could be through education, and through the encouragement of beneficial lifestyle changes. For example, everyone with a

garden can work to improve soil, thereby sinking carbon and making a small contribution to the solution. Community and shared
gardens can also be encouraged for those without land, and these help build community, as well as providing food and recreation.

The Government would need to work with the social sector and support groups to ensure those who are most vulnerable are
supported through the changes. If these are well managed, they could lead to an improved quality of life for everyone, through
warmer and drier homes, better external environment and stronger community.

Yes
Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

The changes required to prevent/minimise climate change could be presented as having benefits to everyone in both the long and
short term, and enable us to more truly personify our 'clean and green' image.
