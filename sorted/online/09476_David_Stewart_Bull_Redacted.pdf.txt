Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

David Bull, David Stewart Bull









Reference no: 9476

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes

 There should be no emissions reduction target in legislation



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 No legislated target



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Notes
 Targets should be aspirational encouraged by incentives if necessary



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 Govt enforced budgets are a costly answer to a problem that probably doesn't exist. Increased atmospheric carbon so far has been

 beneficial to plant growth and food production. Harmful effects are hyped up by politicians promoting their own ideology.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Notes
 No emissions budgets



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes

 As above



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes



 Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
No

Notes



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Climate Commission should be able to carry out independent research into global warming threats if any



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes

An emissions trading scheme is a waste of time and money



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
There should be no zero carbon bill. Any thing that NZ does will make no difference to global carbon or climate. The whole process is

a waste of time and merely panders to political ideology and will massively penalise the country.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
No

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Climate change is a natural process that mankind has only a marginal effect upon. Until real evidence emerges of detrimental effects,

rather than computer models that have been proven to give major overestimates of warming, no legislative action should be taken,
other than aspirational.
