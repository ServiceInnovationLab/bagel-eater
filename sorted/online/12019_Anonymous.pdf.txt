Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill







Reference no: 12019

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes

 I would prefer to leave more time for the research to become clearer around what is the appropriate way to deal with methane. And
 specifically for this science to be well communicated to the public and understood and accepted by those it affects, before it
 becomes law. Otherwise I’m concerned that there will be low buy-in and the resentment between rural and urban communities will

 grow, which would be very counter-productive.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes
 It makes more sense to me that the different gases should be treated differently in law, since their sources and effects are very

 different. I’m concerned that a blanket approach may be chosen that will not ultimately be fair or effective, based on intuitions rather
 than science.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 I’m sure you can find a way to commit to the general goal while leaving room to adjust as appropriate as new information comes to
 light.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 This sounds really helpful for businesses to be able to plan for the future with some idea of what’s to come.



 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
 its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
