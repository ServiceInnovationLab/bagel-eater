Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Steven Rymell










Reference no: 9155


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later

 Notes
 With technology changes it may be possible to advance net zero date, as such there should be more flexibility to set the date



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 Carbon dioxide levels are only part of the problem, other harmful gases and pollutants must be reduced as well



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 New Zealand should not rely on other countries to reduce emissions.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Yes if other methods can be found to be more successful in reducing the rate of climate change or the date could be moved forward.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Yes there needs to be clear short term targets, provided they are realistic and achievable.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Notes
 There should be flexibility to revise budgets according to circumstances. Governments can and do change the law and targets. This
 question is a waste of space.




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 There should be flexibility to revise budgets according to circumstances. Governments can and do change the law and targets. This
question is a waste of space.




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Need to take into account events such as earthquakes, volcanic activity and other events that may make delay achieving targets so

that budgets are meaningless. Should also include population growth which has a significant impact on carbon levels.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
Need plan to achieve goals, so these should be outline in the bill, but do not need to be detailed.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Ensuring they are are realistic and achievable in the time frame.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
I disagree with Emissions Trading. I believe Carbon use should be taxed. With some carbon sequestering efforts being given grants or

tax reduction.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

I disagree with Emissions Trading. I believe Carbon use should be taxed. With some carbon sequestering efforts being given grants or
tax reduction.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
There is consideration of Maori values, but not of the values for other races why?



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes
Unless the government is proposing another bill. Adaption to climate change is more important than zero carbon, there is not point in




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes
Should Including need to be prepared for climate changes in resource management act and building regulations. There is no point in

allowing long term building on land that is expected to be flooded without adequate flood prevention measures.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

Need to be able see that progress is being made



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
The minister opens the discussion paper with references to the adverse impacts, but makes resolving them optional. The focus of

the government should be about action to adapt to climate change which is needed much sooner than trying to reduce the rate of
change which is a more long term goal.
