Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill







Reference no: 12770

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 The second half of the century is, obviously, 50 years long. Choosing such a long, almost indefinite, period so far into the future for

 reaching net zero emissions would be a massive source of uncertainty for the businesses and communities which need to adapt to
 and mitigate climate change. It would add further to the delays which have allowed CO2 levels to continue to increase even as climate
 science has become ever more certain and the danger signals of climate change all the more clear.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 Including greenhouse gases other than CO2 is clearly needed given these make a material contribution to the human-induced

 warming which the Earth is currently experiencing. Methane is around 100 times more damaging than CO2 so a small amount of
 methane makes a big difference. However, I note water vapour is a greenhouse gas, and it would not appear practical to include

 water vapour in a net zero emissions target.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes
 Aotearoa currently emits around 90 million tonnes gross CO2-equivalent per annum, with around 20 million tonnes sequestered from
 forestry and other activities, giving net annual emissions of around 70 million tonnes. It is not clear that a net zero goal can be

 achieved from domestic activities (reducing emissions and increasing sources of sequestration) alone. New Zealand should be an
 open participant in a transparent marketplace for international carbon credits. This will be a form of international trade from which New
 Zealand and trading partners can benefit. However, we should insist on high standards of quality assurance to ensure tradeable

 carbon credits are genuine. The community must be able to be confident NZ is not simply buying the cheapest way out of its climate
 change obligations.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 While the overall trajectory of climate change is clear, its impact and the timing thereof is not. I see a zero carbon framework as

 setting Aotearoa on the best possible pathway towards a zero carbon future, but believe the framework needs to be flexible enough
 to cope with changes to the target if these become necessary. The Bill should state an expectation that any change to the target
 should be premised on new data and sound science, and describe the process by which such a change would be expected to be

 proposed, be enacted and implemented.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Rolling 5-year budgets appear to be a sound approach. This would ensure there is always a pathway of 10 to 15 years evident of

 where New Zealand's expected progress towards zero carbon. This would provide investors with a level of certainty which is beyond
 the investment horizon for many asset classes, and thus help inform investment decisions.
Clause
6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

Position
Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

Notes
Yes, as above some flexibility should be considered, but again the Bill should specify on what basis a change to the budget would be

proposed, how it would be agreed and how it would be implemented (e.g. any changes to transitional measures). As I noted in a
recent article (https://www.newsroom.co.nz/2018/07/12/150535/lets-make-tech-work-against-climate-change#), technology

changes which can help us adapt to and mitigate climate change are many and ever-developing. These may provide a rationale for
changes in the emissions budget, as may further evidence of the impact of climate change being experienced at the time.



Clause

7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

What constitutes exceptional circumstances should be specified. It would be preferable to avoid the situation where future
Governments are influenced by rent-seekers/ major carbon emitters to seek to change the emissions budget without undue cause.




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
These considerations are sound, but the future of workers in industries affected by the transition should also be clearly included.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

Governments current and future should be expected to publish ahead of each rolling 5-year emissions budget the specifics of how
that budget will be achieved, including Government's own emissions, pricing of emissions of businesses and households, support for

carbon sequestration initiatives, transitional support, and proposed carbon credit purchases. Such plans should be transparent to
the public and consulted on to ensure community and stakeholder support.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Industry and community consultation are equally important. Some industries affected by the transition may be expected to oppose

emissions reductions, while others may seek overly generous transitional support. Communities affected by climate change (for
example, those in coastal communities, those in towns with a high proportion of workers in emissions-heavy industries) need to have
the opportunity to be involved, for example through the applicable Territorial Local Authorities. Iwi naturally should be able to

contribute fully in the spirit of the Treaty.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes
On balance I would prefer an independent Climate Change Commission which is empowered to make decisions, so long as these are

within Government policy (such as the emissions budgets), rather than simply providing advice. The Commission could play a role
similar to two existing entities in Aotearoa New Zealand which are empowered to make decisions under a clear regulatory & policy
framework, even if those decisions may be unpopular with the Government of the day, namely the Reserve Bank and the Commerce

Commission.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

In addition to the sorts of expertise proposed, it would be desirable to include some technology expertise. New and emerging
technologies of many different kinds (including but not just Big Data, Virtual & Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence, and Smart

Grids/ Internet of Things) are going to have a profound effect on our ability to mitigate and adapt to climate change. These include
technology evolutions and changes which are not yet evident to us, and whose consequences can certainly not yet be understood.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

Adaptation is a massive challenge and needs to be incorporated in the Zero Carbon Bill.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
These appear to be sensible measures which will be needed to assess risk, form a plan for adaptation, and track the progress of its

implementation.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
Notes

Some large businesses, including large emitters and infrastructure owners, are heavily exposed to climate change risk. Firms which
are NZX-listed should provide quality information to investors on their response to climate change risks. However, it is not clear that

existing sustainability/ corporate responsibility reporting is working well in New Zealand. For example, NZ lags other developed
countries on the proportion of major companies reporting on corporate responsibility matters (see

https://home.kpmg.com/nz/en/home/insights/2017/11/corporate-responsibility-reporting-survey-2017.html). Furthermore, not all
relevant firms are publicly listed. For these reasons, a specific adaptation reporting power makes sense. To minimise the reporting
overhead, this could be a requirement only of major emitters and firms with climate change risks above a reasonable threshold.

Administration could be minimised by making such reporting via existing channels such as the Companies Office or even IRD.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Thank you for the opportunity to make this submission. This is a major challenge for Aotearoa New Zealand. Accordingly it was
excellent to see the high quality of the discussion document. The open and timely process for consultation is also welcome. I look
forward to the Bill being published later in the year.
