Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Barry Reginald Phease








Reference no: 725

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes
 Whatever target is set in legislation now will be too timid, and as more information comes to light the targets will need to be

 tightened. However the legislation should state that no government can loosen the targets once set.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 We have to stop experimenting with the climate. By 2050 it should be pretty apparent that whatever we are doing is not enough.
 Short lived gases are a significant contributor to climate change and we have to reduce them



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 The cost of (credible) climate credits is going to balloon and if we rely on them then it will be much more costly that doing it

 domestically. So far I have not seen any advantage to us from including forest planting. It is generally a short term crutch that avoids
 doing the job properly and the cost of maintaining the carbon sink is going to rise over time, so we will end up wanting to pay it back
 with negative emissions in the future.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 It will need to be changed over time as the extend of the problem becomes more apparent. It should only be allowed to be changed

 to become more severe.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 It seems as good as any option. the budgets need to be strict enough that we are not relying on doing most of it in the last few

 periods before 2050. There may be technology advances that make it easier then, but expecting them is close to "cargo cult"
 thinking. the best way to make sure that technology advances happen is to make them attractive now, but setting proper targets. We
 had a chance in 1990 to phase the targets in gently over time, but we passed that up. Now we no longer have that luxury.




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes
 I think at the end of each 5 year period, the budget for the next periods should be reviewed (downwards) as the conditions will have

 changed. Either there are more options for reductions, or the extent of the problem will have become more apparent.
Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Yes, see above.




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
There are also other considerations, e.g. a better understanding of the real costs of adaptation.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

"Aspirational" targets are not enough any more. There have to be concrete measures and measurements to see progress. It would
be very risky to set a target and then wait 5 years to see if it is being met. There will also have to be industry targets. There are

economic measures (e.g. tax on petrol) which should help to change behaviour, but I think there need to be planned measures (e.g.
urban intensification, public transport etc) that give people more options to avoid emissions.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Industry need to be consulted. At the moment the ETS provides selected industries a subsidy, which can't continue. So industry
groups need to know that they are going to have to do their fair share, but they should be consulted on how they do it. Budget

advisers and other groups working with disadvantaged groups should be consulted for ways that economic incentives don't make life
more difficult. Science and engineering should help to provide targets for industries and individual gases. There may be things that

can't be produced in NZ within our emissions budgets. We have to look to transition the economy to better suit our situation. At
some stage we have to say that protecting certain jobs (e.g. coal mining) is just too risky and expensive.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Of course the government of the day will set the membership and the CCC needs to be protected from political whims.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes
Governments are too keen to ignore advice that they don't like.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
the committee and sub-committee need to have people who will be respected and understand the issues and any numbers put to

them. The categories mentioned are broadly right, but it will depend more on individuals understanding the problem and not being
beholden to any particular sector It is more important to have experts working for them and writing the reports than having experts on
the committee.
Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
The adapting we do now is reactive, and most of it is not accounted for properly. When a sea wall is rebuilt after a storm it is not

written down to climate change. There needs to be pro-active adaptation (which will be much more expensive that people are
allowing for). How do we get people to abandon homes near the beach? What about health effects?



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
Yes, they are pretty general. I think that more will be found when the work is started.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
Sounds like a good idea. At the moment it is pretty much being left up to councils who are afraid of being sued.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

This consultation document is a lot better than the last one. I attended a meeting and had reports of other meetings where the vast
majority of the feedback was ignored in the final outcome. Make sure this process is genuine this time.
