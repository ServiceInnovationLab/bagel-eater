Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Deirdre Kent










Reference no: 12091


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 We should not be leaving it up to a Commission, competent though they may be. Everyone has to own the goal.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 I considered voting for option 2 and realise it is different for methane. I also acknowledge that all ruminant animals emit methane so I
 know this must be taken into account. However our farming industry needs huge change and we must rely less on exporting animal

 flesh and milk powder and more on growing our own and eating it. I know this has consequences for GDP measuring, but we need a
 new way of measuring our well being. If we eat what we grow it doesn't go into GDP yet we are better off. That is the enigma we need
 to face properly and belatedly.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 I have no idea how to answer this sorry.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 Of course.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 It should not be changed by an incoming government, but the government will still need the country's mandate. Maybe a
 referendum, perhaps a binding one.



 Clause

 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
Maybe meetings countrywide in homes should work on this with a wide range of parties present and special facilitators. There was

such an exercise about 40 years ago.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

All the expense seems to fall on local authorities and electing members who favour mitigation and leaving certain flood prone roads,
and not rebuilding sea walls is critical. Commission should be involved in pubic information about council choices.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
Risk management authority to support local authorities.
