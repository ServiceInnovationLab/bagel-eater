Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Meindert Hofmans








Reference no: 12578

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Yes, but only when more or less restrictive targets are agreed to in international agreements/accords - not because we have a
 change of goverment that places a lower value on the environment.



 Clause

 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

 its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Advice alone is not sufficient e.g. Parliamentary Commissioner of the Environment. Many of the PCE reports have been ignored in the

 past so stronger mechanisms are required. Greater empahisis needs to be placed on the environment. Social and economic
 considerations are important but are less important than the health of our planet.i.e there no point in having a great economy when
 the environment can't support it.




 Clause
 13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
 Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes
Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

National co-ordination on adaption is essential. This will remove some of the 'heat' from local authorities that are trying to do the right
thing but are not being supported at a national level. It also means the issue is being adressed in a consistent manner whereas it

currently depends on the political will and funding of each local authority.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

This is a really first good step to taking action on an international issue that previous goverments have underprioritised.
