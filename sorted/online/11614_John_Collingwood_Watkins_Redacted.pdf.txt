 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later

 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes




 Clause

 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes
 All acts in NZ can be changed through due process under exceptional circumstances.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
No

Notes



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Because the Climate Change Commissioners will be following the political agenda, which is to propagate failed science and use this
for ideological purposes to control the future in a Marxist way, they will not have the necessary expertise. Their , main concerns will be

control and regulation of the population and the confiscation of property rights.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
No

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
The hypothesis that human activity would, or can, cause dangerous warming, is the biggest scientific swindle, ever. Whole academic

fields have been captured by an authoritarian, anti-human, communistic ideology. We have a mass media which is deliberately lying to
us. The free and supposedly objective reporting, which we all expect to be true and accurate, refuses to tell us the facts - that the

globe has not warmed over the last 20 years, the ice caps are not melting, sea level rise is not accelerating, and the ocean is not
warming up and becoming more acidic. Basic facts on climate change shouldn't be a political issue, but in today's world it apparently
is!
