Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Stephen Field, Stephen John Field








Reference no: 13013

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived

 gases
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
 Notes

 An understanding how ruminant animal methane emissions are a closed cycle and do not add to GHG. This reduces 44% of NZ’s
GHG assessed emissions. The sequestration of CO2 into pasture needs to be recognised.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Providing the commission bases it’s advice on honest scientific principles and not a political ldeology.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
We should be very careful to develop policy that responds to scientifically measurable climate change that is unquestionably the

result of man made GHG and not to rely on modelling which has proven in past to be often alarmist and exaggerate the risks.
