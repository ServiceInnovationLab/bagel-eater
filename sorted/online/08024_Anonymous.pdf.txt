Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 8024

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No

 Notes
 It's too late! We must take action now. 2050 is it. If we do not change our situation by then, it will be too late to reverse the climate of
 our planet. The plan should be strictly set out so that there is no need to move the goal posts going forward. And if we come out

 ahead then woop!



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 Get serious guys. There is no room for error here. The plan should be strictly set out so that there is no need to move the goal posts

 going forward. And if we come out ahead then woop!



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 Get serious guys. There is no room for error here. Too bad if the politics don't align, this is bigger than politics. The plan should be
 strictly set out so that there is no need to move the goal posts going forward. And if we come out ahead then woop!



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
 Notes
 Too bad if the politics don't align, this is bigger than politics. The plan should be strictly set out so that there is no need to move the

 goal posts going forward. And if we come out ahead then woop!
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Individuals and families should not be taxed unnecessarily - this should be industry tax and applied to those using public services
such as rubbish disposal, public transport systems, fuel (private & public), water (private & public), etc... Install toll booths for major

cities, yes there will be a big outcry but really, when you're only paying $2 each way it's nothing and ensures the correct people are
being targeted.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
So long as they are impartial, above reproach, publicly declare any conflicts of interest and submit to an annual financial audit to

ensure no corruption - all information (clearly not their actual financial situation but the outcome of the audit) to be made public.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

The government (regardless of which party) needs to be separate to this, otherwise politics will destroy the only hope remaining.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
Don't get too bogged down in cultural needs - sorry but we have very little time and a lot to do, too many chiefs will make this fall over.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
NOOOO!!!! That's just another way of giving us a back door. This WILL NOT work without full commitment.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

All organisations - not some - that's a loop hole that we all know people and organisations will utilise to get away with things as best
they can.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Do not f    this up guys! Take a leaf out of Danmark's book - they are a relative success story here. It's not like you have to reinvent
the wheel, just use what is already working.
