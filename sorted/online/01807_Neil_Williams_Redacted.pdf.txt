Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Neil Williams




Reference no: 1807

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 The Govt should not set a target as I disagree with the overall objective.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes
 No target as I disagree with the Bills objectives.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 Neither as I disagree with the Bills objectives.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Should the Bill pass into law I would hope that a future Government will realise the costs associated with an ideological policy object
 and remove the law.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Notes

 No as I disagree with the Bills objectives.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Notes
 Yes, any Government has the constitutional right to change any laws subject to due process.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes

 Yes, any Government has the constitutional right to change any laws subject to due process.



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes
 Yes, but I disagree with the Bills objectives.




 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Position

 No
 Notes
Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The economic cost of acting.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Notes
None, it should not be established




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
But I disagree with Bills objectives. Key skills should be economic not environmental.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes

Adapting to "climate change" is an ongoing activity over hundreds of thousands of years and subject to such uncertainties that
specific course of action are likely to be wrong.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
I cant find on page 47 where you refer to "new functions".



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
No

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
The economic cost of acting far outweighs the benefits as demonstrated by the modelling. As such the ideological imposition of the

bill will create a more adverse outcome than the effects it is seeking to mitigate (even if they are correct).
