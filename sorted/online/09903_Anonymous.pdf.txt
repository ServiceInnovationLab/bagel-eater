 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Through the commission the latest scientific evidence should be used, however any changes must be managed to provide business
 certainty and prevent long term planning becoming a political football.

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Noting that this timeframe is inadequately short in comparison to 30 year infrastructure strategies and the long lives of greenhouse

 gasses.

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
