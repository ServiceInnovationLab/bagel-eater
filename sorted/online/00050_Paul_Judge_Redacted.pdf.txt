 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes
 The govt of the time should be able to review the emissions budget to make it more vigorous given climate change will be an
 emergency situation by then

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Legislation to outlaw fossil fuel powered transport and introduce affordable or subsidised EV technology. Legislate to transition to a

plant-based agriculture and economy. Introduce active family planning programs to reduce or at least stabilise population. Develop
and implement comprehensive education programs on the science of climate change in the schools as current education in this area

is inadequate.

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes

Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
Should include programs to reduce population, to limit capitalist growth and to deindustrialise in key areas of unnecessary consumer

production.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Education and changing the growth paradigm is key to addressing climate change effectively. NZ should be leading the world, along

with other progressive nations, and a massive international publicity campaign should be implemented.
