Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Daniel Mulholland









Reference no: 11033

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes

 I was very disappointed in previous consulations that intermediate targets were not set and that we did not commit to a particular
 target (even if it was low, at the time there was discussions about a 20%, 30% or 40% reduction when Nick Smith carried out
 consultations in the late 2000s). I would like an independent climate change commission to advise on the targets so they may be

 perceived to be science based and potentially less susceptible to suggestions of political interference.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 Our dairy industry is a recent creation and is causing damage to our environment, not just via methane emissions. It should not be
 excluded from legislation or granted a special status. If necessary the government should incentivise alternative land use.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes

 Ideally domestic, but it may take some time to build up sufficient effort to achieve this and so in the meantime carbon credit
 reductions from overseas are acceptable.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 If it was then what would the circumstances be? This looks like a weaselly out to me. I'm inclined to say it should be a firm

 commitment even that can be relied upon and not revisited by successive governments. If it were to be revisited it would be have to
 be determined only by the independent commission and only at intervals of 1-2 decades.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes
 Yes, we don't want to a rod to break our backs and hopefully the distance in time will allow a long term view to be used as the basis
 for the budget.
Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

I don't think so, not on the basis of the commitments previously made. It would be better for this to be a hard restriction.



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
* Impact on those who are less well off. * Coherence of plans to ensure overall investment is targeted to produce long term

outcomes (e.g. in innovation or sustainable land use) * Impact on Maori and Pacific Islanders * Impact on local climate change as well
as global (especially biodiversity and species preservation) * Resilience of the economy and diversification * Providing high value

goods in preference to raw products (increasing the value add)



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
I appreciate the consultation paper and consider the coverage of climate issues in the discussion paper and these submission

questions to be helpful.
