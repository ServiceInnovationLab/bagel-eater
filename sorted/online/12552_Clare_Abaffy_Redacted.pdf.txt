Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Clare Abaffy








Reference no: 12552

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 We need the most ambitious change. We cannot exclude agriculture, we cannot rely on Carbon Emission Trading Schemes and we
 cannot exclude some gasses and include others. So called short lived gasses can nevertheless have long term effects. Even if the
 goverment fails/ refuses to do the above, it should set a target of net zero long-lived gases by 2050 and mandate the Climate

 Commission to recommend or set a 2050 target for so called short-lived gases.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 We should be cutting emissions here (including by planting more forests) in New Zealand and not by buying overseas credits. Zero
 should mean zero. We cannot "contract out" of domestic change.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 The 2050 target should not be able to be weakened, but only strengthened. There shoud be 'no backsliding'.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Yes. Emissions budgets under the Zero Carbon Act should cover five year periods and be set three budgets in advance. This will
 provide long-term certainty.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes
 Budgets should only be changed due to very significant changes in scientific understanding, not political or economic developments.

 The target and budget should be allowed to be streghtened but not wakened, and there should not be any relience on carbon
 trading schemes or ignoring of some contributory gasses.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
Notes

Only strenghten, see previous comments.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes, I agree that they will need to consider: - scientific knowledge regarding climate change - technology relevant to climate change -
social circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel poverty - energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy

supplies and the carbon and energy intensity of the economy - economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the
economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the economy - fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the
decision on taxation, public spending and public borrowing. There should be strong considetation and expertise on poverty and

social security with the ability to recomend that any negative effects be mitigated via public social security spending.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
In setting plans to meet the emissions budgets, the government should be: - making sure they're based on the best science
available - ensuring that they deliver fair outcomes for Kiwis - reflecting the principle of a Just Transition for workers - honouring Te Tiriti

o Waitangi - being environmentally sustainable, especially for New Zealand's unique native plants and animals - maximising the impact
of money spent and being cost-effective - encouraging innovation - unlocking economic opportunities for New Zealanders, such as in

renewable energy - honouring our international commitments, including under the Paris Agreement - consulting people who may be
economically affected, like farmers or businesses - consulting tangata whenua - consulting young people, who'll live to see more of

the impact of climate change - consulting communities already facing the physical impacts of climate change



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Notes
Such schemes should not be used in reaching our 2050 target. Neverthelesss, if they are to be used, the Commission should advise

the government on policy around the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

I agree that members of the Climate Commission should have expertise in: - climate and environmental science including mātauranga
Māori - climate change policy (including emissions trading) - te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori (Māori language, culture,
and philosophy) and Māori interests - knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology development system - risk

management - resource economics and impacts (including labour markets and distribution) - experience with addressing adaptation
challenges like planning, insurance and local government - engineering and/or infrastructure - community engagement and

communications - business competitiveness In addition, they should have expertise in: - expertise in public health - understanding of
our international commitments, including under the Paris Agreement - understanding of the social impacts of climate change and/or

government policy - knowledge of principles of equity and a Just Transition -knowledge of povery and work The commission should
include someone whith specific and dedicated expertise on social consequences including ensuring social security for all Kiwis and

security of work. This roles should not be subsumed into a role driven by business interests and economics.
Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
There should be be a separate adaptation sub-committee of the Commission, as in the UK.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
Yes, the Zero Carbon Act should require: - a national climate change risk assessment - a national adaptation plan - regular reviews of

progress towards implementing the national adaptation plan - an adaptation reporting power Care will need to be taken in managing
the interaction between national and local government roles.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes. This would let the government and the public know about the risks to public and other infrastructure, and make these

organisations better informed about the risks they face.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
We shouold also be assisting other contries including Pacific Contries deal with Climate Change.
