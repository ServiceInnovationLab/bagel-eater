Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

John Lawson






Reference no: 54


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 We should aim for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases to levels which can be offset by forestry.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 yes if net zero can be achieved sooner, but not later



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 Emissions budgets should not be altered in response to “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty. However,
 the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in scientific understanding or international agreements should be permitted.




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No

 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Notes
I'm not sure which 'considerations' the question refers to, but the Government and the Climate Commission should take the following

factors into consideration when advising on and setting budgets (as set out on page 43): • scientific knowledge regarding climate
change • technology relevant to climate change • economic circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the economy, as

well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the economy • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on
taxation, public spending and public borrowing • social circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel poverty • energy

policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy supplies and the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
The UK's Climate Change Act is less effective due to failure to specify a strict time frame for producing a plan. The problems are
summarised from page 24 of

https://www.productivity.govt.nz/sites/default/files/Examining%20the%20UK%20Climate%20Change%20Act%202008.pdf.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable
and reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Notes
The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to
the number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Notes
I agree with the following collective expertise: • climate change policy (including emissions trading) • resource economics and

impacts (including social impacts, labour markets and distribution) • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori
interests • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like

planning, insurance and local government • risk management • engineering and/or infrastructure • community engagement and
communications. • business competitiveness • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology development system.

I think expertise in public health is also important.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within the Climate Commission.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance is required in terms of how local councils are involved: • a

national climate change risk assessment • a national adaptation plan • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
adaptation plan • an adaptation reporting power
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Some of the answers above are 'yes, but'. Therefore in some cases I've ticked the 'not specified' box.
