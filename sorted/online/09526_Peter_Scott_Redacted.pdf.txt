Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Peter Scott





Reference no: 9526

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes
 Further monitoring of global temeparature is required. Satellite monitoring of temperature over the last 30 years shows that the global

 warming models overestimate the temperature rise.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Notes
 Further monitoring of global temeparature is required. Satellite monitoring of temperature over the last 30 years shows that the global
 warming models overestimate the temperature rise.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 Further monitoring of global temeparature is required. Satellite monitoring of temperature over the last 30 years shows that the global
 warming models overestimate the temperature rise.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Notes
 Further monitoring of global temeparature is required. Satellite monitoring of temperature over the last 30 years shows that the global

 warming models overestimate the temperature rise.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 Further monitoring of global temeparature is required. Satellite monitoring of temperature over the last 30 years shows that the global

 warming models overestimate the temperature rise.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes

 Further monitoring of global temeparature is required. Satellite monitoring of temperature over the last 30 years shows that the global
 warming models overestimate the temperature rise.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 Further monitoring of global temeparature is required. Satellite monitoring of temperature over the last 30 years shows that the global
 warming models overestimate the temperature rise.



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Further monitoring of global temeparature is required. Satellite monitoring of temperature over the last 30 years shows that the global
warming models overestimate the temperature rise.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

No
Notes

Further monitoring of global temeparature is required. Satellite monitoring of temperature over the last 30 years shows that the global
warming models overestimate the temperature rise.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Further monitoring of global temeparature is required. Satellite monitoring of temperature over the last 30 years shows that the global

warming models overestimate the temperature rise.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes
Further monitoring of global temeparature is required. Satellite monitoring of temperature over the last 30 years shows that the global

warming models overestimate the temperature rise.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Notes
Further monitoring of global temeparature is required. Satellite monitoring of temperature over the last 30 years shows that the global
warming models overestimate the temperature rise.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Notes
Further monitoring of global temeparature is required. Satellite monitoring of temperature over the last 30 years shows that the global

warming models overestimate the temperature rise.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes
Further monitoring of global temeparature is required. Satellite monitoring of temperature over the last 30 years shows that the global

warming models overestimate the temperature rise.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Further monitoring of global temeparature is required. Satellite monitoring of temperature over the last 30 years shows that the global
warming models overestimate the temperature rise.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
No

Notes
Further monitoring of global temeparature is required. Satellite monitoring of temperature over the last 30 years shows that the global

warming models overestimate the temperature rise.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Further monitoring of global temeparature is required. Satellite monitoring of temperature over the last 30 years shows that the global

warming models overestimate the temperature rise.
