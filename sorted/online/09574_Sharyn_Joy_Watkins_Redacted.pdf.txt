Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

John Watkins, Sharyn Joy Watkins









Reference no: 9574

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes

 Climate fear is being used to take away human freedom and empower governments. "We are not going to change the world by
 tinkering around with nonsense." (Piers Corbyn)



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Carbon Dioxide - Reducing net carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2050

 Notes
 There is no observation that shows CO2 warming this planet's atmosphere. No evidence that an increase of CO2 by 0.01% in the

 atmosphere alters the climate significantly. Methane is broken up very quickly in the atmosphere by sunlight and chemical reactions.
 It is a trace gas, essential to life. The idea that it is a more powerful greenhouse gas than CO2 is an ignorant lie, which is repeated by
 propaganda over and over again. "Of course you can't kill all of the methane bacteria, or the cow would die" (Dr Kai Grevsen)



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes

 Forests ruin productive land which can be used for food crops. There is environmental damage when they are harvested. There
 needs to be different varieties of trees to suit the locations chosen.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 We are always told that the revenue from emissions trading, or carbon taxes, will be used for energy and climate change adaptation

 purposes. THAT IS AN OBVIOUS LIE ! Politicians regard it as a new revenue source. No one should fall for the carbon tax trap.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 No

 Notes
 It is planned to make the climate crises industry so enormous that no one will be able to dismantle it, even as computer models and
 disaster claims totally lose credibility.




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes
 All acts in NZ can currently be changed through due process under exceptional circumstances.
Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Emission budgets cannot be increased, unless the government changes the act through the usual parliamentary process. If there
are exceptional circumstances the government can change the zero carbon act.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Regulators, researchers, universities, businesses, manufacturers, pressure groups, journalists, and politicians now have such strong
monetary, reputational and authority interests in climate alarmism that they will defend its tenets and largesse tooth and nail. They

should consider the scientific knowledge about climate change, the technology relevant to their plans, the economic circumstances
and competiveness of particular sectors. The fiscal circumstances apparent at the time, with regards to taxation, public spending and

borrowing.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
No

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The Government needs to keep reality in mind. By raising costs throughout the country, attacking the agricultural sector and the
transport sector, productivity will collapse, our economy will be damaged, our money will be squandered.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes
The commission can also advise how NZ stays within these these budgets, how NZ can best adapt to climate change, and monitor

progress on NZ's emission reductions. The Climate Change Commission will be a vast money wasting bureaucracy. People will be
required to waste precious time on emission budgets, adaptation plans and emission targets. They will be monitored and

investigated. Lose their livelyhood and privacy. All for a devious and fraudulent hoax.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

The commission must also identify the extent of regressive impacts from proposed ETS settings, and propose effective
complementary policies which fairly compensate vulnerable households. The Climate Change Commission is not capable of making
decisions itself, in respect of the number of available units in the ETS. The IPCC has not provided convincing evidence, based on

observations of the real world, that man-made greenhouse gases cause dangerous global warming. So the Climate Change
Commission is ignorant of the facts required to make a judgement according to the ETS.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
It is important that scientific knowledge and practical experience be a major expertise. Mechanical and engineering skills are also
important, as well as experience in the health/hospital sector. The Commissioners should all be trustworthy, hardworking and reliable

members of society. .



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes
This is an important area. Even though the science of climate change and its causes is devious and corrupt. Climate change will

happen anyway, and adapting to climate change and adverse effects related to it has to be planned for. It is always prudent to be
prepared and historically, actions to avoid and lessen disaster have already been discovered. Such important activities as drainage

and regular maintenance of waterways, by dredging and deepening channels, have been allowed to lapse. Houses have also been
built on what had been flood plains in the past.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Care must be taken with adaptation policies to ensure that climate damaging emissions are not increased



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
No
Notes

This will end up with public money being spent to entrench the lie. Not-for-profit organisations will be chosen to "empower local
leaders with skills and tools to build more climate resilient communities"." To develop vulnerability assessments, response plans, as

well as tools and case studies for future sharing".



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
These 8 words are the death of climate change - "It violates the Equivalence Principle, therefore it's wrong." The Equivalence Principle

says - If data cannot distinguish between two things, then the two things are identical. The IPCC claims human emissions will linger in
the atmosphere for hundreds of years, and 15% will remain forever. That claim violates the Equivalence Principle. Nature's CO2 has a

half life in the atmosphere of only <5 years. Therefore human CO2 also has a half life of <5 years. Nature cannot distinguish between
the two sources.
