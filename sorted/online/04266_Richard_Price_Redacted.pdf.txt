Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Richard Price





Reference no: 4266

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 However, there should be recognition for the materials NZ produces and exports which contribute to climate change emissions,
 which could potentially be offset by green tech exports. This would include such things as weaponry components which are later

 deployed by third-party nations.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 There should a provision allowing for revision in the event technological advances allow a significant reduction in time needed to
 meet the policy purpose. Extending the time frame because of Government-of-the-day desires should be minimalised at every
 opportunity (being mindful that every Government sets its own agenda and policy direction).




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 5 year horizons allow for international economic fluctuations which will occur as the policy outcomes are being transitioned in. They
 will also enable an agile response to real impediments in achieving the policy outcome.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes

 If cross party agreement is obtained, then there shouldn't be a need to legislate for this aspect. The electorate will be quite vocal if an
 incoming Government looks to de-fund or otherwise compromise the stated policy objective.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes

 Same as above



 Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

I would like to see a broader consideration of factors that will impact the labour market as this policy objective is being met. The NZ
labour force will also be contending with increased automation and the introduction of AI technologies. Consequently, shocks to the
labour force could negatively impact achieving this policy objective. The Government and advisory Commission need to be abreast of

more than GDP implications of this policy objective for it to be a success.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes
Well articulated plans with a RASCI model embedded will allow for both greater governance and transparency of tracking policy

implementation.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

The desired expertise should be aligned with the frame-works of other advisory commissions in terms of being best-fit for the
purpose of the commission. Strong advice from across responsible agencies for science, business, and governance should be

mandatory prior to appointments (Cabinet Honors and Appointments Committee type rigor).



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Must ensure strong tie ins with local and regional councils/territorial authorities.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

This should not be onerous on private entities and could form part of the work Stats NZ already does with NZ businesses.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
While the policy outcomes are very much needed, there is a question on strategic risk oversight. Climate change is recognised

internationally as a National Security threat by many western nations. In that vein, New Zealand should recognise climate change as a
National Security threat and afford it treatments and strategic oversight by the Cabinet National Security Committee and subordinate

officials' committee and watch group(s). As a matter of international representation regarding New Zealand's commitment to the
policy outcomes as proposed, the Bill should prohibit trade negotiations which would either dilute the purpose of this policy objective
or otherwise add to international climate emissions by the other party(s) to a trade agreement. Through this policy objective and

subsequent Bill/legislation, New Zealand must be seen to be a leader in climate change management. This is this generation's
nuclear free moment, and we need to grasp the potential as well as be honest as to the cost as openly and robustly as possible.
