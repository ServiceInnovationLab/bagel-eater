Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Richard Laurenson, Up2iT Ltd (Richard Blair Laurenson)









Reference no: 32

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 Carbon sequestration in the soil needs to be recognised by the ETS if farming is to be included. This can be achieved by measuring
 the organic matter in a soil annually. Moreover legislation needs to be included which requires any nitrate application to soil being

 required to include a carbon source with it such as humates, humic acid, fulvic acid or biomass. The added carbon will have the
 increased benefit of increasing the cation exchange capacity of the soil increasing the soils organic matter and its ability to reduce

 nitrate leachate into our water ways. Both of these items will incentivise farmers to change their practice, impact significantly the
 proposed carbon budgeting, improve environmental health and other flow on benefits pertaining to animal and human health.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes
 If international carbon units are to be used there should be a phase out plan for these unless there are extenuating circumstances



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 Time is running out we need to be resolute.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes

 Resolute is an ideal for the long term whereas flexibility in the short term is required



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
Yes

Notes
The exceptional circumstances need to be specified and if this option is exercised a plan needs to be provided that brings us back

on track before the relief action is taken.



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
All carbon sequestration needs to be recognised this includes what occurs in the soil.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

it is important that there is some accountability from the government in regard to recognising the recommendations of the
commission as the setting of the carbon price has a big impact upon the goals being set in the the Zero Carbon Bill.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
All the areas proposed are relevant but we need to have a full input from the agricultural/horticultural sector as methane from

agriculture is a major source of Carbon in our Economy.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
Getting to zero carbon is important but we need to manage the process and climate change is a result of not-zero carbon - they are
interlinked and need to be considered in unison.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
Care needs to be taken not to make this bill too cumbersome thereby increasing the time to implementation.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes

Notes
Provision could be made for this entity to be set up in the bill but perhaps its brief could form part of the commissions role.




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

It is of paramount importance that the soils role be recognised in this issue in order to encourage farming practice to increase the
soils organic matter. "A great deal of the carbon once stored in the soil is now stored in the atmosphere - 30% of CO2 can be

countered by humus-building (based upon just the top 15cm)" Graeme Saite . Humus Saves the World, Ted Talk. Moreover it has
been estimated that a 1% increase in US crop lands alone would take take 4.5 billion tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere and return

it to the soil. Recognition of this principle and applied to NZ will have huge benefit to the proposed Carbon budgets.
