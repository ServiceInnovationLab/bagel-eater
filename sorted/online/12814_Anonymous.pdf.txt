Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill








Reference no: 12814


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 The science is clear. Time to stop making excuses and get it done. Think long term and make the hard calls



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 Net zero of all green house gasses. We will have to diversify our economy, as we have had to in the past. This does not need to be a
 bad change. There are opportunities if we act now.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 Domestic emissions trading would be preferable. Why send millions offshore for fraudulent credits. Create a carbon market here; put
 an effective price on carbon and incentivise business to reduce emissions. It seems that most businesses who are thinking long

 term are asking for a price on carbon so they can adapt.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 The science should dictate what we do. Do not cop out and say that we can't do anything or pander to certain sectors of the country.
 We are all in this together. Climate change shouldn't be a political football.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes
 Again, the science should dictate this. I'm very uncomfortable with politicians using this as a way to score points.



 Clause

 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 This seems like a good way to stop 'kicking the can down the road'




 Clause
 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

 Notes
 Work with farmers. I think if people are given the evidence and a fair way of dealing with the problem, then people will be on board.
Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes. I'm generally in favour of an independent commission to take the politics out of big/controversial issues. The risk is that it may
not have any power



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

This is really important. Let the evidence guide policy and take the politics out of this. It's just too important to stuff up.
