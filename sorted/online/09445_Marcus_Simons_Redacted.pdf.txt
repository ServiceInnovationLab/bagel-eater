Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Marcus Simons, Simons and Cree








Reference no: 9445

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 We should use the best science we have now to make strong decisions to achieve a 2050 target.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 Different strategies for implementation will be required for short-lived and long-lived GHG.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 The target date could be brought forward (ie earlier) if new scientific evidence shows that it is required for good climate outcomes.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes

 This should only be changed in exceptional circumstances and for the benefit of good climate outcomes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 This should only occur to speed up the transition to net zero emissions and with the approval of Parliament.



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes we support the suggested considerations, however, we recommend that priority be give to the following new considerations: (a)

the need to preserve healthy ecosystem functions for life supporting capacity, biodiversity protection and to provide ecosystem
services. (b) NZ to provide international leadership to stabilise the climate and to successfully comply with the target limit for the
wellbeing of future generations. (c) the need for precautionary approach, given uncertainties on GHG emissions and climate change.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

More funding to biodiversity protection including the Department of Conservation.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Environmental science must include biodiversity expertise.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
Reporting is essential.




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
The current underlying model of economic growth being able to continue indefinitely when the World's resouces are limited is flawed.

This must be part of a wider risk assessment.
