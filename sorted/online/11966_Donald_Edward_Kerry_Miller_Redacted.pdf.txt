Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Donald Edward Kerry Miller








Reference no: 11966

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 Means to actually reduce methane emissions must be developed and omitting short-lived gases from the equation now could reduce
 the research efforts required.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 International carbon units should not be utilised. Forest planting has limitations and production forest plantings may be largely
 pointless, as the sequestered carbon in the soil may be largely lost by clear felling (see attached document). Shipping of logs emits

 significant carbon, as does internal log transport. Emissions from international tourism are a significant issue - both by aircraft and by
 cruise ship. Unwise to base a major part of our income on it.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 As the reality of the extent of climate change already set in motion is unlikely to become a reduced threat, only revisions to further

 decrease emissions could be made.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes

 Changes should only be made to further decrease emissions.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
Yes, but only to make the emissions regime more strict.




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Notes
There can be no denying that reducing carbon emissions will be painful for the economy. If too much consideration is given to the

inevitable hardship then it is possible no effective changes will be made.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The largest emitters are, in general, the largest creators of foreign exchange. They must not be allowed to over rule emissions policy.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes
Potential political instability issues will reduce as the full effects of climate change start to become obvious.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Avoid stake holder representatives. The situation is way past having sector bun fights.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes

The insurance industry will lead otherwise.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
While I am greatly relieved to see the issue of anthropogenic climate change finally being addressed, knowing that I was introduced
to the issue at university over 50 years ago makes the extremely delayed start appalling. I firmly believe that a strong public education

program must be a major part of this policy. The negative impacts of online trolls, possibly funded by the fossil fuel industry, must be
countered and climate scientists must not be muzzled. Scientists in the climate change denier camp should be closely investigated

in respect to their sources of research funding.
