Reference no: 8265


Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 Setting a firm target creates greater certainty and a more stable environment in which investment decisions can be made, early on.
 Doing so will ensure that the required investment into infrastructure is made early on and that 2050 targets have a higher chance of
 being met.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
  Managing emissions reduction requires long-term behaviour change. Reducing methane from all sectors – including the agricultural

 sector - requires that technologies and new methodologies be introduced early on to combat the long-term effects of global warming
 resulting from greenhouse gas emissions. Clear policy signals and firm targets will stimulate investment into low emission agricultural

 techniques, ensuring that NZ is able to be more resilient in terms of managing its immediate natural environment, managing its
 emissions, and building long-term export market resilience by maintaining a competitive edge over international market competitors
 through related efficiency gains, and a strengthened brand and reputation for premium quality produce.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 By relying on domestic carbon sinks and abatement technologies, New Zealand will encourage local and foreign direct investment

 into solutions, and will avoid transferring emission abatement obligations overseas or buying in potentially sub-standard credits.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 The only scenario in which an adjustment might be considered necessary is one that demands an even more stringent target to be
 set (i.e. a target set against a baseline earlier than 1990).



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 Five year cycles provide achievable short term goals that will enable New Zealand to stay on track for meeting its 2050 target.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 Setting firm budgets signals stability and certainty to investors. The likely knock-on effect would be a stimulation of local investment in
 clean tech; and a stimulation of inflows of foreign direct investment into New Zealand as a hub for clean tech innovation. By contrast,
 on-going adjustments to any given carbon budget should only be done so in the context of where targets are being exceeded or

 outperformed i.e. if New Zealand’s emissions abatement trajectory is on a steeper downward curve than originally estimated, the
budgets may be adjusted to reflect that, and in doing so support sustained, strong performance.




Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes
Unless New Zealand is outperforming its targets, in which case the budgets should be revised to sustain forward momentum.




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Four key issues to consider are: 1. Decarbonising buildings: Adjusting current building standards and codes to support future carbon
targets. A focus on the following areas could deliver positive carbon reduction outcomes: a) All new building stock be mandated to

adhere to green building codes and meet sustainability criteria. The minimum mandatory requirement be at least Home Star 6, in
terms of energy efficiency. Future-proofing new builds should be a primary consideration in terms of capturing the potential for low

carbon emission energy generation and storage (i.e. solar conduit battery use and electric vehicle charging capacity in all new builds).
b) The existing housing stock of 1.8 million homes - 800,000 of which are currently not adequately insulated - represents a significant

opportunity and challenge in terms of reducing emissions, with particular regard to Government’s recent legislation relating to
mandatory heating requirements. The lack of affordable insulation and energy efficient heating appliances, energy-related emissions
may be exacerbated by an initial supply shock (where demand outstrips supply). Government should therefore consider whether the

existing policy framework is fit-for-purpose in terms of transitioning to a low carbon economy and whether New Zealand be looking to
other frameworks i.e. that of the UK where energy rating systems have been introduced, and where subsidies and tax reliefs are

leveraged to stimulate investment into and market growth of insulation and energy efficiency products. c) In view of the forthcoming
Building Code review, building standards such as H1 Energy Efficiency Standard (NZS 421:2009), should be reviewed with the

objective of mandating minimum standards that deliver carbon savings through energy efficient buildings. The current requirements
are currently inadequate and should be tightened. 2. Renewables and clean tech: Leveraging appropriate policy tools to support
Governments long-term carbon reduction target through renewable energy generation and EV charging infrastructure. For example,

manage the anticipated largescale uptake of EVs and associated energy demand management, subsidies and taxes could be
leveraged by: - creating an environment conducive to fast-tracking much needed investment in EV charging infrastructure -

supporting the build out of distributed energy with energy storage, and/or district heating and cooling (with storage) - sidestepping a
potential demand crunch on existing energy sources, transmission and grid infrastructure. - increasing low carbon utility-scale

renewable energy generation (i.e. fast tracking consented utility-scale onshore and offshore wind and ground mounted solar arrays,
hydro energy and more). Encourage investment into infrastructure that supports nascent technologies such as - hydrogen fuel cells

2. Domestic food supply security: Transport emissions associated with increased food imports will negatively weight the carbon
budget. A recent report from HortNZ indicates that on the current population growth trajectory, demand will outstrip future supply of
domestic vegetables by 2020. Transport emissions associated with increased food imports will negatively weight the carbon budget.

Domestic food supply is pivotal to carbon targets being met, given that food represents the greatest portion of consumption
emissions (32% of Auckland’s household emissions according to the 2014 report by Motu Economic Research– Greenhouse Gas

Emissions New Zealand: A preliminary Consumption-based analysis (Romanos, Kerr and Will); and food and restaurants accounting
for 30% of Auckland’s per capita consumption emissions according to C40 Cities consumption emissions data report 2018. Careful

assessment of land allocation for housing development is urgently required (balancing housing vs food security - reference the
HortNZ 2017 report); ensuring prime growing land is protected from housing development; and that domestic supply of vegetables
can meet demand; and that climate change and carbon reduction is embedded in land-use and planning policy. 4. Public transport

infrastructure: Citing the respective Motu Economic and Public Policy Research and C40 Cities findings for Auckland’s consumption
emissions, transport accounts for the second-largest share of emissions from households (27% - Motu) and individuals (23% - C40

Cities). Ensuring that adequate investment is allocated to public transport infrastructure, particularly in new, high growth areas such
as South and North Auckland, is key to reducing per capita carbon emissions. Plans tabled by Greater Auckland (congestion free

network and Regional Rapid Rail) merit consideration. In terms of who the government should be working with, strategic partners
would include: Communities – Behaviour change is pivotal to New Zealand meeting its carbon targets, in terms of reducing

household carbon emissions. Communities should be actively engaged, educated, encouraged and incentivised to prioritise energy
efficiency, sustainable travel and low carbon consumption habits. Large and medium-sized businesses are also key partners with
regard to their influence in shaping consumer behaviour and related environmental outcomes. Local Boards, councils and community

groups are also primary stakeholders, holding valuable knowledge in terms of material opportunities in any given area and holding
valuable insight into effective community engagement methods; and effective programme deployment.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

The Climate Change Commission will be comprised of New Zealand’s leading minds/sector/subject matter experts. It will be well-
informed to take such decisions, as an independent body.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
The balance may be further improved if business expertise was added to the mix, with the result being a Commission that is more
representative and informed - to the extent that it can set reliable targets independent of government. Private sector representation

could potentially be included on a rotational basis, to improve accountability and avoid the risk of perceived bias.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes
Yes, in terms of ensuring that risks are well understood and that the policy framework in place addresses these risks and enables

decisive action to be taken to diminish, mitigate or pre-empt risks.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes

Notes
Mandated reporting requirements will serve to improve transparency and will assist organisations and Government in more effective

risk management.
