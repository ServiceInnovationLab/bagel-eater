Reference no: 10116

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 Significant pathways to emissions reduction for New Zealand include, (apart from tree planting), 1. The substitution of fossil fuels with
 carbon neutral biofuel for transport, electricity generation, and industrial process, institutional and domestic heating, 2. Sequestration
 of carbon for soil remediation with the use of charcoal either as by-product of industrial heat from biofuel, or purpose produced bio-

 char with heat as the by-product, 3. Remediation of agricultural soils degraded by conventional practices, with restoration of complete
 natural soil biomes of microflora and microfauna. (Note, an astounding amount of carbon has been released to the atmosphere from

 this source). (Christine Jones, 2009) These pathways are currently available or are in immediate view. Examples follow: Biofuel
 cropping. Giant miscanthus on marginal land, a high yeilding perennial crop maturing in 3 years, is the preferred species for
 production of renewable diesel fuel, but is also a superior soil conditioner with carbon sequestration,(Renquist & Kerckhoffs 2012). It

 would also serve as feedstock for synthesis gas production of other hydrocarbon liquid fuels via the Fischer-Tropsch process.
 Advanced combustion techniques. MILD (flameless) combustion gives highest heat energy yields with lowest noxious emissions yet
 achieved (CO < 1 ppm, NOx < 50ppm), and is ideal for burning even high moisture content biofuels. The submitter has been able to

 demonstrate that this technique works at a 5-10kWe power level and can sustainably consume billet wood directly off-the-stump,
 when coupled to a pyrolytic gasifier. Thus making very low emissions small scale industrial and domestic burners possible. Application

 of this type of burner to institutional and domestic heating has far reaching implications. For example, it is possible to configure a
 domestic burner to work on a 24hr fuel cycle in which the burner is fueled but once per day. Refueling done just prior to the evening
 national electric energy peak would contribute to the reduction of the evening peak load, and to the following morning peak. At the

 conclusion of out-gassing charcoal remains that can be used to sustain the fuel chamber temperature until the next fresh fuel
 loading occurs. A hot start to a new fuel cycle ensures a very fast return to MILD operating temperatures so that there are never any

 visible particulate emissions. Melhuish suggests that energy efficiency retrofits of 600,000 under-insulated homes, together with
 adoption of MILD-combustion wood burners in 30,000 hard-to-heat houses could eliminate the need for 6-7 new fossil gas fired
 electric peaking stations in the period to 2050.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
Clause
6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

Position
Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

Notes
Implement change only if facts and scientific concensus indicate overall national benefit




Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
