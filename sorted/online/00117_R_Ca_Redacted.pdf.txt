exposure to climate change risks?

Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
It seems the NZ Public have no idea what the impacts are for the change. The speed with which MFE are rolling out the review plans

exceeds the ability for NZ Inc to respond. NZ MFE need to make better consideration of the requirements for 'change management.'
The web site has far too many documents for the average person to fathom and read. The Climate document referred to in this
survey could not be found. The impact likely impact changes, indirectly form a tax. These new taxes are likely to surprise NZ Inc.
