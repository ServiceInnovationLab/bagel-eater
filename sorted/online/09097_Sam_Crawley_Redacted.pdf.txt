Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Sam Crawley





Reference no: 9097

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 As a developed nation, NZ is in a good position to demonstrate that a net zero emissions economy and society is not only possible,
 but can be prosperous. Relying on international carbon units is not consistent with that approach. In fact, NZ should seek to become
 an exporter of emissions reductions units. Poorer countries, many of which have low levels of industrialisation, may need to emit

 longer in order to achieve development to levels equivalent to NZ. By purchasing international carbon units, we are depriving poorer
 countries of the finite (and quickly diminishing) resource of allowable GHG emissions.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 For pragmatic purposes, targets should be allowed to be revised. However, clear guidelines should be set for what those
 circumstances are.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

I agree with the plan proposing that the commission has an advisory role rather than a decision-making role. This is consistent with
our political system: the main decisions are made by elected officials who are accountable to the public.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

I have not seen information on how the appointment process will operate. Given that there are likely to be some highly charged
political issues around the commission, it may make sense to set out this process in more detail than usual. For instance, it may
make sense to set term limits for commissioners. This could limit the ability of future governments to make political appointments to

the commission, which bias its recommendations towards short-term political goals. This kind of "stacking" of an organisation is
typically harder for voters to hold to account, as it is less visible than the usual things voters consider when casting a vote.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Although a net zero target by 2050 is ambitious, it is likely to be insufficient to avoid even 2 degrees warming (even assuming all the
world's major emitters do the same). Recent research has shown that global emissions must peak by no later than 2030 to have a

reasonable chance of staying below 2 degrees (https://eciu.net/assets/peak-emissions/), and even this assumes negative
emissions will occur on a large scale later this century. Given this reality of the situation, it is worth considering an even more

ambitious target: net zero by 2040.
