Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Quaker Settlement (marion Sanson)








Reference no: 10817

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes
 Agree that having the targets set by independent Climate Change Commission should put the targets outside party political

 interference.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 Aotearoa New Zealand needs to step up to an ambitious but necessary target.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes
 There could be a case for drawing on some emissions reductions from overseas, but this should not be as a matter of course. We

 should save this option for if an emergency situation disrupts planned progress.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes

 The 2050 target could be adjusted upwards, but not downwards.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Agree, puts it outside the current electoral cycle.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
Not advised, could lead to drift away from the target, and a government possibly being able to use this to advantage.




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes
This is how we can hope to achieve the necessary reductions. The Climate Change Response Act in its current form is too weak.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
Local government will have a role to play as the changes affect services provided by local government. It will be important to re-

position the Resource Management Act so that local government plans and regulatory activities support the central government
plans.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
However, do give consideration to whether the functions of an existing body could be enlarged to take the role of holding to account,

e.g. Office of the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment?



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

Placing responsibility with the Climate Change Commission would reduce the prospect of interference by the Governing politcal party.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

Not clear about aspects of the policy, e.g. is sharing information obligatory? Better if it is not but organisations see benefits in doing
so.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Local governments need to be resourced and empowered to assist in meeting the targets and putting in place adaptations to meet
climate change.
