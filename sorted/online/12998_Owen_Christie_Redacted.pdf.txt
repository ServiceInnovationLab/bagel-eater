Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

owen christie






Reference no: 12998


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes

 Don't set targets for something which is not a problem. Stop wasting time and money.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Notes
 Any target will result in the death of living organisms. We know this is the United nations agenda 2030. Stop proposing solutions that
 end in death. This is a deluded policy if it thinks it will be good for any people.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 Pull out from the climate change treaty



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Notes
 Don't even pass the bill. Get rid of the ministry and save tax payer dollars to pay for more useful things like more nurses.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes
 No money should be available for climate change. End of story.




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Notes
 No emissions budgets should be created.



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes

 As above



 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 Zero carbon is a dangerous and deathly proposition
Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
Self sufficiency in nz. Stop reliance on foreign capital. Break any international treaties constraining us.

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

No

Notes

None other than terminating any foreign commitments.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No
Notes

No. climate change is well proven to be unfounded scientifically. Stop wasting any more money and effort. Instead focus on how to
make nz more productive and self sufficient.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes




Clause

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Even more costs, with no benefit.
