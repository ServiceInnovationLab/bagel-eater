Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill











Reference no: 119

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Carbon Dioxide - Reducing net carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 Put a charge on emissions (like a millionth of a cent today) but have it gradually rise so by 2050 the cost of emissions become
 significant, so we can sell our emission capacity to overseas buyers. Has to be small to start with for domestic reasons, and to

 prevent our economy being significantly harmed.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Should be 2100, but it should not be able to be changed once set.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 3 year, 9 year and 15 year plans instead, but given the other questions have 5 years set, I think this is already decided.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Sustainable economy, and sustainable environment should be the primary concerns. The rest should be secondary, keep the
commission focused on the goal, not destroying the country on the way, and that's it.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Quality of life for Kiwis and Kiwi businesses, and how achievable the goals are. Goals like 'no one should drive on Tuesdays to reduce

emissions' are no go's, and 'shut down the oil and gas industries' should be no go's.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Should also play a role towards setting the overall goals, so the decisions are less for political points.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

Independent is always better. Needs to be apolitical, and to minimise pain while achieving the goal.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes
Should be more a mixture of real world experience and theoretical. Also somewhat representative of the population, both in culture,

belief and socio-economic background, so the commission has more knowledge on how their policies will hurt and harm the NZer on
the street. Preferably a mix of characters with varying beliefs on how significant climate change is.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Would prefer to not have my name published on the website. Also, focusing on emissions is the wrong area of focus on the
environment. The primary focus should be on water and land, rather than the air. But as long as this is not at the expense of efforts to

improve our waterways, build toilets, prevent the spread of disease that is killing our natives etc. is fine. Decisions impacting NZ
should be do holistically. e.g. stopping extraction of resources, will overall the environment be better, or will we just import more of
things that harm the environment. Consult departments and parties that the changes will hurt. The Taranaki oil fiasco is not the way

to go, not consulting departments or the industry until the decision had already been made.
