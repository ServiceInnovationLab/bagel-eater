Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 1204

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 As scientists learn more about the causes, extent, rate of change and implications of climate change, the problem becomes
 increasingly urgent. We don't have the luxury of time in which to stop carbon and other emissions, especially as the rest of the world

 has to compensate for having a climate-change-denying lunatic in the White House.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 We don't have time to be half-hearted in combatting climate change. We have to go all the way as quickly as possible if the planet is to
 survive.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 Carbon trading as a system has already proved to be vulnerable to fraud. We have already been sucked in. We should not repeat our

 stupidity. The Government should instigate carbon taxes on polluters with the money used to help people whose homes are made
 uninhabitable because of climate change. In our area, we already have houses being washed into the sea. Insurance companies
 refuse to insure any homes that are vulnerable so people walk away with nothing. As the scale and rate of destruction increase, we

 are going to have huge numbers of homeless people if there is no government system in place. This will inevitably lead to social
 unrest. These people have poured their life savings into their homes and suddenly they have nowhere to go. The scale is already
 significant here and people still have to pay rates on uninhabitable homes unless the councils choose otherwise. There is no law that

 says councils have to stop charging rates in these circumstances. In our case, in Buller, councils, in approving and supporting coal
 mining, and in making sure that ordinary people cannot complain about breaches of consents, are ensuring that the maximum

 amount of coal is being stripped out as fast as possible. They are actually exacerbating the problem then rating damaged homes and
 charging for consents for people to build bunds to try to save their homes (as has happened at Granity). The councils profit on all
 counts. It's disgusting. Only the Government can put a stop to this. So far, governments have exhibited a complete lack of interest in

 protecting West Coasters against coal mining.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 But only to make it more stringent.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

Notes



Clause

7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

But only upwards.



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
We obviously need to consider the economy but we also have to consider that our great-grandchildren may live in a very small

country with its borders overwhelmed by people fleeing from sea-level rise, drought etc. You need to work with scientists, economist,
social-sector experts - all areas of expertise really. The problem is so big it's hard to get one's head around it.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes

I think the ETS is a stupid idea. Have a carbon tax because where else are you going to get the money to rehome hundreds, maybe
thousands, of people.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
I think this is a separate issue.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
But remember that some of us are already trying to survive climate change. It's urgent.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
No

Notes
The Government needs to act instead of mucking around in endless afternoon teas.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

I do not want my name published. Living here is dangerous enough for a 'tree-hugger' without this.
