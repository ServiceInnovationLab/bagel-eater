Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

mark, Gold'n Pear (Mark Fort)








Reference no: 10571

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 The Bill should include a clause requiring amendment to be subject to a 75% majority so that there is cross-party adherence and
 cannot be easily repealed or amended by a subsequent government.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 I support emissions budgets but do not agree they should align with electoral cycles as this would encourage politicisation. Climate
 change is too important to be subject to political argument and would defeat the purpose of having a target set in legislation. The

 three, 5 yearly cycle as proposed is supported. We consider a review in 2030 is appropriate, as set out above.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 We support emissions budgets but do not agree they should align with electoral cycles as this would encourage politicisation.
 Climate change is too important to be subject to political argument and would defeat the purpose of having a target set in legislation.
 The three, 5 yearly cycle as proposed is supported. We consider a review in 2030 is appropriate, as set out above.




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No
 Notes

 None of the proposed options are supported. I support a review in 2030 or if requested by the Climate Commission or by
international agreements.




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Impacts on other environmental values eg freshwater quality and native habitats should be a key factor.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
Scientific evidence, how to positively involve businesses and industry including evidence of what has been achieved, mechanisms to

smooth out the effects on the socially and economically disadvantaged, flow on effects on other aspects of the environment (e.g. on
freshwater and natural habitats), how to best implement changes to local government policies and rules e.g. a national policy

statement containing provisions to amend planning documents directly.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

I ask that the Commission is appointed by the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment rather than a Minister or Cabinet. It
should be mandatory for the Government to respond to the Commissionsâ€™ advice within 3 months of receiving it including publishing

reasons for any advice not being accepted.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS and monitoring the implementation of the ETS, recommending changes

where necessary.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

Yes but the expert in resource impacts and/or environmental scientist should have expertise to assess impacts on freshwater and
other native habitats.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

But not if it means any delay in implementing the major part of the Bill.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
I want to see a huge growth in the use of both wind and solar power included in building projects especially state apartment blocks

where joint use of hot water services can be achieved. (Cooperative systems) Electrical energy looses approx 30% of its total when
being distributed so we should have short line systems as with solar
