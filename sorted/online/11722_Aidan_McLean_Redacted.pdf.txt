Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Aidan McLean








Reference no: 11722

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 It is vital to set a clear and ambitious emissions reduction target now, this should drive sector wide adjustments towards a low
 emissions economy. Not setting a target now continues a precedent of kicking the stone down the road and not getting started on a

 path to mitigating climate change.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes
 I support the stabilization of short-lived gasses by 2050 to allow for a longer adjustment period for the primary sector. However I

 believe that there should be more strict and heavily monitored time frames and interim targets set to achieve this so that the sector
 does not lag in innovation and investments in emissions reductions. I believe that the Climate Commission should advise on a target
 beyond 2050 for net zero Methane.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes

 My position is that international carbon trading markets should only be accessible to sectors provided that certain criteria are met for
 domestic reductions. I believe that the Climate Commission should advise on setting up progress indicators for the various sectors. If
 reductions in emissions are lagging on set goals and time frames, international carbon markets (which have been vetted extensively)

 should become accessible to 'pick up the slack' only if progress indicators have been met prior.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No

 Notes
 The target should be robust. The time frame (~30 years) is sufficiently long enough to insulate against significant global events and
 allow for the appropriate domestic changes to occur.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes
 With this set up, if governments intend to change the third emissions budget they will need to be thinking in terms of a 10 year

 outlook when they do this. This maintains a long-term outlook focus which is in line with the long-term outlook of the bill.
Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
However, this should be rare to the point it may not ever happen. The circumstances should be extreme to trigger a governments

need and ability to do this. Such as major domestic natural disaster (ie Alpine Fault earthquake, or major losses to a major city) or a
major economic collapse (ie 2008). The bill's wording around this circumstance should be very clear.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
Each successive government should be held accountable to the requirements of the bill. Governments need to demonstrate

progress towards the overall emissions target of net zero and the 5 year budgets.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

National environmental health / overall state of environment, growth of national GDP and household incomes, indicators on national
happiness, progress in innovations towards emissions reductions. The costs of future climate change and the costs of the last 5
years of climate change. The govt should work with Iwi, industry bodies, environmental NGOs and international regulators like the UN

and the world bank when looking to set plans.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

An advisory commission based on the UK model would be suitable/necessary to guide the national response to climate change.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

Should be advisory with mechanisms to hold governments to account on their requirements to the bill.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes
A separate body within the climate commission based on the UK model should be set up to advise on adaptation measures in order

to standardize adaptation approaches and measures in different sectors.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
Overall I am submitting in support of the proposed bill, New Zealand needs a clear and ambitious emissions reduction target, with a

robust framework and advisory body with staying power to achieve this target.
