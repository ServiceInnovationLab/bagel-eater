Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Levonne Smit








Reference no: 1018

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 Check with the real scientists. There is no climate problem. The weather is cyclical and there is nothing we can do about it. Protect

 the waterways from pollution and rubbish only and don't tax us to death!



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 If we have zero carbon dioxide emissions the plants will die then so will we!



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 No money should be taken from tax payers!



 Clause

 13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
 Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No
 Notes

 Talk to scientists who haven't been paid to spin the climate change mantra!



 Clause
 15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

 functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes



 Clause
 16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

 exposure to climate change risks?
 Position
 No

 Notes



 Clause
 Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

 Notes
 There is so much information telling us that climate change is a myth. Please Please check it out before going any further with this.

 The climate is a natural occurrence and we should not be taxed for it!
