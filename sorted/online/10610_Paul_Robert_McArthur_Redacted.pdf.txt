Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Paul Robert McArthur






Reference no: 10610


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 This is needed to provide some surety for New Zealanders. The Act should however provide for this target to be made more
 stringent if new science or events dictate but not less stringent.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 This is necessary in order to have the best chance of meeting the Paris Agreement commitment. In addition, given the uncertainty of
 many of the projections, it is important for the greatest reductions to be made early, rather than later in the period between now and

 2050. This is particularly important for gases like methane that are much more damaging in the short term.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 We take responsibility for our own emissions and offsets and not transfer this burden to any other state. It is difficult to have adequate
 safeguards for international offsets given the ongoing possibility of natural events such as fire or a rogue state or Government.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Yes, but only in the case of a more stringent limit or shorter timeframe being identified as necessary by the Climate Commission and

 that recommendation receiving Parliamentary approval. In this context, New Zealand’s target must be primarily guided by the Paris
 Agreement and by any future international climate agreements signed by the Government.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 The third budget should only be revised in exceptional circumstances on the recommendation of the Climate Commission and with

 the approval of Parliament but not at the whim of an incoming government.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
Yes

Notes
Yes conditional on the recommendation of the Climate Commission and with the approval of Parliament, but not at the whim of an

incoming government.



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Needs changing as follows, and in this priority order: (New) the need to preserve healthy ecosystem function for life supporting
capacity, biodiversity and to provide ecosystem services. ii) (New) the need for NZ to play its genuine and just part in the international
effort to stabilise the climate and to maximise the probability of successfully complying with the target limit for the wellbeing of future

generations iii) (New) the need for precaution, given the level of uncertainty attached to estimates affecting the rate of GHG
emissions and climate change iv) (New) the likelihood and the potential impact on climate change of any scarcity of material

resources on the economy and GHG emissions, particularly that of fossil energy v) the three Government objectives for climate
change policy: sustainable economy, global and local leadership and creating a just and inclusive society vi) the Government’s

obligations under the Treaty of Waitangi vii) social circumstances and, in particular, the likely impact of the decision on fuel poverty viii)
(altered) scientific knowledge about climate change and its limitations ix) technology relevant to climate change x) energy policy and,

in particular, the likely impact of the decision on energy supplies and the carbon and energy intensity of the economy xi) fiscal
circumstances and, in particular, the likely impact of the decision on taxation, public spending and public borrowing xii) economic
circumstances and, in particular, the likely impact of the decision on the economy and the competitiveness of particular sectors of

the economy



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes
A 6 month time frame is suggested




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
The the Climate Change Commision be required to use a highly precautionary budget that makes highest rates of emissions decline

in the first years and does not rely on overly complex technology or technical breakthroughs to achieve it. That Government require
that the Climate Commission includes in their recommendations to Parliament clear process and timelines to make it straightforward

to turn proposals into firm, funded policy and actions.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes
In addition, the carbon price in the ETS should be subject to a rising floor and ceiling price, as recommended by the Productivity

Commission.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
The Zero Carbon Bill be focused primarily on mitigation but recognises that adaptation andmitigation overlap and are both essential

aspects of climate resilience.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

I support the preparation of a national climate risk assessment, a national policy plan to address those risks identified, and a
monitoring and reporting framework. In addition, I recommend that a Risk Assessment for New Zealand be undertaken in parallel and

that the climate change risk assessment inform that more general enquiry.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

Important to have oversight for this work nationally. Local Authorities are currently struggling with this function.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
It is important that the concepts of :   *improving the overall well-being of all New Zealanders,   *having regard to a wide range of

communities of interest and population groups in New Zealand society,   *the need to live within the material and energy limits of
Earth’senvironmental systems essential for human and other life, and   *the need to integrate climate transition, adaptation and
mitigation requirements with responses to other risks we face be incorporated in the purpose and aims of the Climate Change

Commission. There is insufficient acknowledgement of the need to develop an ethic other than exploitation of the Earth’s resources
for human utility as the dominant principle underlying our economic activity. Profound shifts in our values, culture and way of life that

are required if we are to build and sustain the necessary impetus for change. For example, our continuing uneconomic growth makes
us complicit in a process that is triggering an ecological catastrophe for our children and generations beyond them.
