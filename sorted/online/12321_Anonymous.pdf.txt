Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 12321

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 Also: the option to adjust the target to be more ambitious in response to the advice of the Climate Change Commission. But NOT an
 option to weaken the target.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 The second draft of the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C finds substantial differences in the harmful effects of global

 warming limited to 1.5°C compared to 2°C above pre-industrial levels – where the 0.5°C warming difference is critical for vulnerable
 regions. Limiting global warming to 1.5°C sensibly will require global anthropogenic CO2 emissions to reach net-zero by 2040,

 together with rapid reductions in other emissions, particularly methane. With this in mind, net zero emissions by 2040 should be New
 Zealand's target.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 International emissions units will be volatile in price – and relying on these undermines decisive domestic investment here in NZ.
 Relying on international tradeable emissions units means NZ misses out on opportunities for wellbeing and equity co-benefits of

 reducing our domestic emissions. This means delaying the real changes for later, when they may be poorly planned and rapidly
 executed, with fewer co-benefits and greater likelihood for negative unintended consequences than well thought out plans starting
 now. Reforestation, horticultural planting and improved soil health (which will absorb some of New Zealand’s carbon dioxide

 emissions), can be part of meeting our domestic net zero emissions target. But our main focus must be rapidly reducing NZ’s
 greenhouse gas emissions – all gases, all sectors. NZ (businesses, iwi, communities, whānau, households, and all sectors) needs

 certainty to act decisively now.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Notes
 The target should only be altered to increase climate action ambition in response to updated scientific recommendations. There
 must be no backsliding (i.e. weakening of the target).



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Three 5-6 year emissions budgets covering the next 18 years, with our “legislated net zero emissions by 2040 target”, gives the
 certainty needed for action and investment now. Given the urgent need for global emissions to peak by 2020, the Act could also

 include the requirement for the Commission to urgently set an initial 2-year Emissions Budget. This 2-year Budget would fit within the
 first 5-6 year Emissions Budget.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Notes
The last budget should be able to be reduced if needed to respond to emerging international evidence. The Zero Carbon Act should

also permit any Government to act so NZ can emit less than budgeted. However, emissions budgets cannot be increased.



Clause

7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

The second budget should be able to be reduced if needed to respond to emerging international evidence. The Zero Carbon Act
should also permit any Government to act so NZ can emit less than budgeted.




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
The physics of climate change comes first for setting Emissions Budgets – the bottom line is what ends up in our shared global

atmosphere and oceans, and making sure ecological tipping points are not breached. As the impacts of unmitigated climate change
will be highly regressive on New Zealanders the priority must be robust emissions budgets. The Climate Commission’s Emissions

Budgets must be consistent with the best possible chance of limiting global warming to 1.5°C degrees and the greater responsibility
of well-resourced nations like NZ, with Budget considerations limited to: Scientific knowledge about climate change, sea level rise
and ocean acidification Obligations under Te Tiriti o Waitangi Global leadership, including international equity The Commission then

advises the Government on mitigation policies (including Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) settings) for the Government plans to
keep NZ’s future emissions within the Commission’s budgets. Te Tiriti O Waitangi obligations and fairness within New Zealand are top

priorities for policy and planning. Other considerations include substantial health co-benefits and technology relevant to climate
change – in ensuring a fairer, just, sustainable Aotearoa-NZ.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

The Zero Carbon Act must require the Government to respond by publishing plans to stay within budget as rapidly as feasible, within
a set time limit that is certainly less than 12 months.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Other considerations include sustainable economic opportunities and technology relevant to climate change, to grow a fairer, just,

sustainable Aotearoa-NZ. The Government must work in Te Tiriti partnership, and with NZ’s most vulnerable communities (those
already disadvantaged and those working in high-emissions industries), to create a hopeful, fairer future.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes - but the Commission should also set the Carbon Budgets. This is would ensure that our targets are based directly on the
expertise of the Commission.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
The Commission should advise the Government on ETS policy settings so that New Zealand emits within budget.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Notes
I think that the "high level of standing in society" condition should be dispensed with. The term is vague and could be interpreted in

multiple ways. If individuals are experts in their field to a sufficient extent their "level of standing in society" should not matter.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes
Adaptation must be a separate advisory work stream, to avoid overtaking the Commission’s top priority climate mitigation role




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance is required in terms of how local councils are involved: • a

national climate change risk assessment • a national adaptation plan • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
adaptation plan • an adaptation reporting power



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
There is so much to love about the world we live in. Climate change represents an existential threat to that - in the face of what we

stand to lose by failing to act decisively against climate change, other considerations seem small. With this in mind, I believe the right
course of action is to be prepared to make significant compromises to short term gains if it means safeguarding our world for those

who will inherit it.
