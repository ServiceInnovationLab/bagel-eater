Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Matthew Dean Raeburn








Reference no: 12815

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 Setting the 2050 target now will help the Government plan on how to fulfill New Zealand’s commitments under the Paris Agreement.
 As the Ministry for the Environment acknowledges in the Consultation Document, a 2050 target in the Zero Carbon Bill would provide

 more certainty about the direction for the transition. Providing a clear signal to New Zealand businesses and governments will assist
 them in implementing appropriate strategic responses, including assessing the risks and opportunities resulting from the economy-
 wide transition to achieve the 2050 target. Until businesses and governments know the 2050 target, they may be inclined to defer

 key strategic planning.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 As a signatory to the Paris Agreement, New Zealand has committed itself to achieve post-2020 reductions in greenhouse gas
 emissions and take action on climate change. New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions profile is quite rare amongst the Paris

 Agreement’s signatories; emissions from New Zealand’s agriculture sector constitute a significant plurality of the country’s
 greenhouse gas inventory.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 Emissions reductions to meet the net zero by 2050 target should be domestic. International carbon units have longstanding
 challenges with verification, and their prices will increase dramatically as other countries compete for them. Further, keeping our

 emissions reductions domestic would also keep the co-benefits at home in New Zealand.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 New Zealand is particularly at risk from severe earthquakes and other natural disasters that could necessitate a revision to the 2050
 target. The Zero Carbon Bill should allow the 2050 target to be revised only if the Bill also states expressly which changing

 circumstances would open up the 2050 target for revision. Such circumstances should be specified as clearly as possible, be likely to
 produce major consequences for New Zealand and New Zealanders, and be difficult to predict – a major seismic event is a relevant
 example. This approach would be consistent with the Ministry’s proposed approach to revising emissions budgets in the event of

 natural disasters. One area the Government should carefully consider is whether including significant changes to economic or other
 non-natural circumstances is also appropriate. Climate change and technology, amongst other factors, will lead to significant

 disruption that may alter the composition of New Zealand’s economy dramatically between the time the Zero Carbon Bill is written
 and 2050. In contrast, a market correction may be a changed circumstance but not necessarily one that businesses do not already
 account for, and New Zealand is not noticeably more at risk than any of the other Paris Agreement signatories of being impacted by

 changing global economic and geopolitical circumstances. To reduce the risk of the 2050 target being changed based on the
 political priorities of a new government rather than climate science, and to better ensure revisions to the 2050 target are appropriate

 and properly implemented, the Zero Carbon Bill should require the Government to seek the advice of the Independent Climate
 Change Commission on whether a revision is prudent and, if so, the extent to which the 2050 target should be adjusted.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
Position

Yes
Notes

A five-year emissions budget, with the next two five-year budgets set afterwards, should provide a reasonable certainty for most New
Zealanders.



Clause

6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
Position

Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
Notes

For the reasons also stated in response to Question 4 regarding changes to the 2050 target, the third emissions budget should be
able to be changed based only on certain specific, legitimately unanticipated changes in circumstances. Making changes to the third
budget only if the subsequent emissions budget is set helps to offset the uncertainty created by the changes to the third budget.

And as with changes to the 2050 target, the Zero Carbon Bill should require the Government to seek the advice of the Independent
Climate Change Commission on whether a change to the third budget is prudent and, if so, the extent to which that budget should

be adjusted. This will also reduce the risk of the third budget becoming a frequent target of changes even when such changes may
not be adequately supported by the science or the economics underlying the net zero by 2050 target.




Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
The Government has the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under exceptional

circumstances. Although New Zealand may not be more at risk than any of the other Paris Agreement signatories of being impacted
by changing global economic and geopolitical circumstances, New Zealand is certainly more at risk of natural disasters, such as a
severe earthquake. That said, changing the second emissions budget raises serious implications for business certainty and the

equity of the resulting impacts. For that reason, the Zero Carbon Bill should allow the second budget to be revised only under
extreme circumstances if those extreme circumstances are specified as clearly as possible, be likely to produce major consequences

for New Zealand and New Zealanders, and be difficult to predict.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
Among the key issues should be considered when setting emissions budgets are: ► businesses’ capital allocation and investment

planning cycles, particularly for projects and assets intended to mitigate those organisations’ greenhouse gas emissions; ► New
Zealand’s subsequent NDCs, which are intended to keep New Zealand on track with meeting its Paris Agreements; ► aligning

emissions budgets with New Zealand business’s obligations under the NZ ETS; and ► the Ministry’s reviews and the Climate Change
Commission’s periodic reviews of the emissions budgets. Sufficiently aligning those cycles and timeframes is crucial for ensuring the

emissions budgets serve their intended purpose.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes. Moreover, the Government should clarify the extent of the relationships the Climate Change Commission will have with the
Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment, the Climate Change Adaptation Technical Working Group, the Ministry for the
Environment and the New Zealand Productivity Commission, among other Government entities, to reduce inefficiencies where other

Government entities are also advising on or monitoring the same or similar issues.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

The Climate Change Commission will already have its work cut out, advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS and
climate change adaptation among its other responsibilities. The New Zealand Environmental Protection Authority and Ministry for the

Environment are sufficient to administer and make policy decisions regarding the NZ ETS.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

Adaptation to climate change is an essential component of New Zealand’s climate change strategy and should likewise be a
substantial component of the Zero Carbon Bill. As the Ministry acknowledges in the Consultation Document, New Zealand’s climate
is changing, and urgent steps are required to manage and mitigate its costly physical impacts. Even as we consider reducing current

and future greenhouse gas emissions, we are already locked into some amount of inevitable climate system impacts. The issue is
how to manage and mitigate the impacts of climate change when even under a globally binding consensus for action, New

Zealanders will need to plan for a future of climate uncertainty. New Zealand businesses and government entities already see these
changes are happening. On 6 July, the New Zealand Herald published an op-ed from Kate Beddoe, the Chief Risk Officer of Vector

Limited. Ms Beddoe referenced a report, which looked at how Vector’s assets network would be impacted around Auckland either
directly, with king tides and storm surges, combined with rising sea levels, causing a critical substation to be inundated during

flooding; or indirectly — more frequent, strong winds bringing down more trees on to power lines. The report for Vector found climate
change would cause increased risks to Auckland’s electricity network, mainly from weather related causes, and Vector should
prepare now. The big April storm, when nearly a third of Auckland had no power at one point, provided a classic example of how New

Zealand’s climate is changing in disruptive and costly ways. Hurricane-force winds, the severity of which was possibly due, in part, to
existing climate change, blew thousands of trees and branches on to lines all over Auckland. Unsurprisingly, the TCFD

Recommendations, which the New Zealand Productivity Commission recommended in April that the Government endorse, require
businesses to report on their physical risks from climate change in addition to their transition risks. Adaptation is a way of extracting

economic value out of actions that New Zealand businesses are already doing. As Ms Beddoe mentioned, the report provided
recommendations to mitigate the increased risks from climate change. And many of those recommendations are already well under
way, such as Vector’s existing network maintenance and strengthening programmes covering 8000km of overhead lines and

10,000km of underground lines, managing trees near lines, and increasing the share of distributed generation, storage, and demand
management across the network to improve the ability to absorb storm events. For reporting and for resilience, New Zealand

businesses, as owners of much of the physical assets and infrastructure at risk from the impacts of climate change, will need to
collaborate with Government at central, regional and local levels to engage in adaptation planning and implementation. The Zero

Carbon Bill should provide a robust mechanism for facilitating that collaboration.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

The Government’s proposal that it, rather than the Climate Change Commission, holds responsibility for the national adaptation plan
is reasonable. Also reasonable is that the plan should be updated at five-yearly intervals to synchronise with the five-yearly climate
change risk assessment process.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
Consistent with the increasingly accepted view that the climate-related disclosure is overwhelmingly beneficial and that the Task

Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosure's Recommendations provide an appropriate framework for New Zealand businesses
and governments entities to report on their actions to address the physical impacts of climate change, we agree on the relevance of

an adaptation reporting power in which organisations share information on their exposure to climate change’s risks. Further, the
adaptation reporting power should, like the TCFD Recommendations, encourage voluntary disclosure of opportunities in addition to

risks. Consistent with the TCFD Recommendations, opportunities should also be shared. Most of those opportunities are likely to be
in the area of climate change’s transitional changes rather than the physical changes. However, a government mechanism for sharing
lessons learned and mutually beneficial opportunities would be of great value to New Zealand businesses and government agencies.




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
This is the defining issue of my generation. Be bold in ensuring that we and our children will be able to enjoy decades of the benefits
of living in a net zero, prosperous, cleaner and greener New Zealand.
