Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Leslie Wilson Jones




Reference no: 8920

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 second half of the century is too vague, could be 2090 and we haven't got that much time to stop warming



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 The option Net zero long-lived gases and stabilised short-lived gases is a trick because it counts the short-livedness of methane
 twice. The first time is when methane is brought into the inventory at GWP100 (28 times CO2) which gives methane as 33.8 Mtns

 CO2e or 43% of our gross emissions (2016 ghg Inventory). GWP100 adjusts the warming potential of methane taking nito account
 the fact that it breaks down overabout 10 years. Then when we look at how much to reduce CO2 and methane under option b, we
 say reduce CO2 to zero but only stabilise methane "because it is a short-lived gas". Surely because we have already accounted for

 methane's shortlivedness we cant give it special treatment again. Methane's 33.8 mtn CO2e has to be cancelled out by minus 33.8
 Mtns of CO2, a virtually hopeless task unless we actually reduce methane emitted hugely



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 It might need to be stronger if global warming accelerates



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 Need annual budget for every year from now to 2050 immediately



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 But many of these things give vested interests a loophole to oppose what we really need to do if it affects them financially
Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The fundamental principle must be that of fairness. That means the burden of emission reduction must be fairly shared across all
sectors of the economy, agriculture, energy, waste and IPPS, in proportion to their current emissions. i.e. agriculture emits 49 % of

NZ gross emissions, therefore it should make 49% of the reductions



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Assume you are referring to the bottom half of p 42. The top half is more critical. I strongly oppose delegating decisions to an
independent authority. In a democracy the parliament makes policy and decisions, not a reserve bank type technocratic group.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

I feel strongly that by adding matauranga Maori to "climate and environmental science" it dilutes the primacy of this expertise which
should be placed first and foremost. What has business competitiveness got to do with this?



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes
It is a separate area completely. Has nothing to do with the words 'zero carbon'
