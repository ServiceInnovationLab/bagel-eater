Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill












Reference no: 9980


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes
 This is the most realistic approach and much more likely to gain widespread acceptance because it provides a reasonable pathway

 for the agricultural sector. However, I believe that a reduction in the levels of short lived gas emission must still be a part of the target
 because we must aim for a scientifically acceptable stable climate at an acceptable temperature.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 I am not too well versed in the ETS, but in its current iteration it is not doing a particularly good job at reducing emissions because
 cheap credits can be imported (as well as other reasons). I also believe that New Zealand should achieve 'true' carbon neutrality, as

 opposed to having to rely on carbon credit imports.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Locking ourselves in to a target 30 years away is absurd. New information obtained, as well as the future effects of climate change,
 mean that the context we set the target in today is bound to be different when 2050 comes around. We may need to set a more or

 less ambitious target for any number of reasons.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
The budgets have the potential to have big social and economic impacts which can be hard to foresee, especially when the

circumstances for New Zealand change. We need to be flexible so that we can work around issues that arise.



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
The socioeconomic impacts in particular should be a strong consideration, and I believe we must have a plan to mitigate the potential

for fuel poverty.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes
Cant have a goal without a plan!




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
I believe that the Climate Change Commission should play a key role in advising the government. This is because it will be

independent, ensuring that realistic and fair targets are set whilst being able to hold governments to account. The process should be
transparent and justified. In particular, I believe there is huge potential for New Zealand to become a world innovator in emerging

technologies which can help climate change. New Zealand has always been a technological innovator and fighting fighting climate
change can be seen as an opportunity. As before, I also believe we must have a plan to mitigate the potential for emission budgets to

cause fuel poverty.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
I believe the ETS is flawed as it allocates far too many credits and does not provide a particularly meaningful incentive to reduce

emissions. However, I also do not believe that an independent body should be able to decide how many credits are available or
allocated because these bodies are harder to publicly hold to account. Public discussion needs to be had about how and where the
ETS fits into the Carbon Zero goal, in particular concerning the agricultural sector.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes
Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
