Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Karuna Kerry L Nelson









Reference no: 9715

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes

 ASAP we must plan more trees and be responsible in the way we fell trees. As you probably know trees emit oxygen and absorb
 carbon dioxide emissions especially when we have healthy Forests No more allowing of petroleum exploration or fracking. Oil
 cushions the tetronic plates. Anyway has God given us permission? ???? Intensivist farming of animals is causing them stress you can

 tell by their stools which are unhealthy ie the cattle in particular have diarrhea. They should be allowed to feed their young before
 being put on the milking machines



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 ASAP you might think me off point but pertaining to the detriment of Patient care and Staff levels and esteem of all workers under the
 neoliberalism movement which is prevalent here I have some comments as follows Chapman talk about a nonsensical comment
 National has not invested in the health care sector for so long their DHBs have been telling the health care managers to cut back

 spending the Nurses have not gone on strike for "30 years " Nurses are stressed and their numbers or lack thereof have made their
 working conditions untenable!!!! It is not just remuneration but staffing numbers for the safety and quality of health care Nurses are
 expected to deliver. Also as will other Public services stop contracting out services that should be under the Umbrella of the Health

 care services ie Public Health and Councils. I know, Nurses, off point but not really. Governments have run down the services to
 people, and the workers under private contractors have very few rights and little job security, which affects workers self esteem. Such

 as cleaners and maintenance and Food catering all should be "in house" ie under Hospitals not contracted out to private
 organisations. Imagine Nursing being under private contractors! !! This applies also to Councils! !!! 2.3b spent on Defense probably
 at the behest of the American Government they spent this money. Nurses help and heal: war toys destroy!!!!
