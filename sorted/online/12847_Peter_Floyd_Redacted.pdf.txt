Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Peter Floyd, Peter Grant Floyd










Reference no: 12847


Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Carbon Dioxide - Reducing net carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 The reduction in Greenhouse Gas emissions and the meeting of New Zealand’s Climate Change obligations is very much in the mind
 of officials and the thinking public. Many groups are looking into new chemicals, genetically modified crops and rumen bacteria, plant

 and animal breeding, growing more trees, etc. as a potential means of reducing or avoiding the GHG problem. Soils are the World’s
 largest terrestrial carbon sink, containing far more carbon than the plant life on the surface. However, the carbon above and below

 ground is inextricably linked with plants using photosynthesis to extract CO2 from the atmosphere and convert it to carbohydrates
 that flow to the roots and are exchanged for minerals from soil microbes. This underground economy fosters the growth of plants,
 animals and soil organisms. Their eventual decomposition results in organic matter (58% carbon) building up in the soil, improving

 water holding capacity and fertility. Research around the world has shown clearly that small changes in land management practices
 can have large effects on carbon capture and so can be natural and very cost effective means of offsetting carbon emissions.
 Sequestering atmospheric CO2 into soil carbon can help NZ achieve a Net Zero-Carbon Economy and avoid the need to purchase

 $14 Billion of carbon units overseas. The potential for soil carbon accumulation as a technique for mitigation of climate change is now
 receiving renewed interest worldwide. This was highlighted by the recent “4 per 1000 Initiative: Soils for Food Security and Climate” –

 an action plan under the Lima-Paris Action Agenda, which aims to demonstrate that agriculture, and agricultural soils in particular, can
 play a crucial role where food security and climate change are concerned. The eCOGENT turnkey farming system has now evolved to
 the point where it has been developed into a specialist climate change mitigation technology branded CLIMATEPOINT. This process

 offers enormous potential for farmers to sequester atmospheric carbon into the soil, build soil fertility and resilience, and improve the
 profits and satisfaction that farming families can achieve. By the New Zealand Government or a responsible organisation immediately

 supporting the implementation of this turnkey technology would allow the dairy industry alone, to achieve soil carbon levels of 1.5%
 per year in order to achieve a Net Zero Carbon by 2050. However, evidence suggests that by doubling these levels to 3% per year
 would allow a robust foundation for the establishment of the Climate Act and Commission and allow all pastoral farmers to produce

 quality food at premium prices and allow a Net Zero-Carbon economy to be achieved by 2035.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes
Clause
6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

Position
Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

Notes



Clause

7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The Government needs to utilise farmers ability to sequester soil carbon



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

Should also include practical farmers expertise



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
There is no doubt that a Net Zero Carbon Economy can be achieved with the use of best practice pastoral farming technology and

with the building of levels of Soil Carbon, Green House Gases can be reduced and Climate Change can be mitigated. Pastoral farming,
properly managed, can sequester significant amounts of atmospheric CO2 into the soil and in so doing meet its Climate Change

obligations as New Zealand signed up to meet, in the 2015 Paris Agreement.
