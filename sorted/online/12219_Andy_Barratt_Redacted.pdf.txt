Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Andy Barratt










Reference no: 12219


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 NZ has delayed for far too long. We need to set the boldest deadlines now.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 Choosing this option sends a strong message that we need to make changes ourselves and not expect others to do it for us. There

 would still be the possibility of drawing on overseas emissions reductions if there was a significant emergency.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 This is simple pragmatism. But the circumstances need to be clearly and carefully described so that this does not provide a
 government with "carte blanche" to revise targets downwards.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Pragmatism again. But (again) definition of "exceptional circumstances" is absolutely essential. Rather than define natural disasters as

 an exceptional circumstance, it would be necessary to define how a particular circumstance makes it IMPOSSIBLE for us to meet our
budgets.




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The most important issues are: (1) transport and (2) land use. With regard to land use, it is essential that the government consult
very widely (not just the standard, "business-as-usual" interests) but "fringe" groups, eg. organics; farm forestry; Tane's Tree Trust;

small farmers; Biological Husbandry Unit at Lincoln, etc. This is where the real potential for innovation will come from.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

The CCC should also be required (in collaboration with other agencies, where appropriate) to disseminate information in a concise
and readable form so that the general public can keep up to date with action in NZ and around the world. The CCC should be

required to provide specific advice on investment in research into alternatives to conventional land use practices (e.g. hemp).



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

Must also consider whether ETS is the appropriate long-term mechanism, rather than others (especially a Carbon Tax).



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

I would specify that someone with wide-ranging expertise in land use is essential. This could need more than one person (eg.
someone with agricultural background and someone with forestry background). Most important of all, they should be INDEPENDENT
OF EXISTING INDUSTRY GROUPS.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

The CCC must take very seriously the second challenge (p.19): "significant changes to our energy, transport and agricultural
sectors". While holding fast to targets and budgets, the CCC's advisory function must include practical alternatives for industry and

agricultural interest groups to pursue.
