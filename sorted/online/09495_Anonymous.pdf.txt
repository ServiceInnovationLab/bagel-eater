Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill








Reference no: 9495


Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 It's important to be accountable now!! and also give individuals, groups and businesses the information what and how they can work
 towards; cimate change is real, the govt has acknowledged this with changing its military strategy, insurances and growers and
 farmers know it's here, coastal communities, too. Just legislators and large corporates need to catch up asap.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 All gasses are affecting climate change. Methane produced by ruminants must be included as they are such a huge contributor of

 our total greenhouse emissions



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 Also there should be support of, and perhaps reward for green technology and innovation. Change to electric public transport
 vehicles, rail and support for vehicle sharing, cycling and improved pubic transport. If we rely on others we don't really have the price

 or the quantities in our hands. We need to build the capacity to do it all here. New forest planting can only be taken into account if it is
 done for primary forest not for commercial forestry as the latter provides only temporary carbon capture and will result in additional
 emmissions further down the line. Reduction has to be achieved to a behavioural shift, real car sharing not Uber-cheating taxi service.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Yes but only in reducing it sooner if innovations prove effective or if climate change progresses more rapidly or in general any

 changes need to occur in favour of the environment, even if it hurts a bit. Because the big pain will come if we are not prepared to
 take the little pain.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 Yes in giving time frames and milestones, clearer goals can be targeted and reached. Each time frame also allows for resetting of
 budgets to ensure the 15 year goal is reached.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 as the effects of climte change are never as intimately relateable to a disaster, a conservative govt would simply change to their
 political liking and on re-election rather than a true environmental goal/budget.
Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes there needs to be some flexibility due to unpredictable changes in science, technology, natural disasters, less in economy as we
have to pull through this in order to come out the other end and the reason why we are where we are in this predicament is that $$-

economy has always won over eco-economy.



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Livestock Farmers - to assist with reducing methane emissions, erosion, transition to sustainable organic polyculture land fertility

practices, planting of waterways and wetlands and fencing vulnerable areas. Horticulture -assistance with moving away from huge
monoculture and chemical practices which destroys biodiversity and in fact erodes the livelyhood of farmers. Transport - transition to
train, monorail, public transport EVs and cycling. Industry and Importers: Single use items taxed or discouraged in other forms,

Container Deposit Legislation schemes (also for tyres, batteries, beverages, even takeaway meal containers, in general all plastic
containers) , Stewardship schemes, cradle-grave schemes and need to be supported by the single use items tax.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Yes, for a democratic process it is essential that the Government is accountable to an Independent private commission which

represents us and is the capable, knowledgeable "checks and balance" function.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes

I still think we should have a carbon tax instead!!! it feels wrong to trade the health of the earth and humanity in a capitalistic system,
that's what got us here in the first place.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes, they should be highly regarded people with a variety of expertise such as in climate change and environmental science,

business, engineering, social policy, Maori interests, and communication. There needs to be a gender balance of 50:50 and include
wahine Maori of course.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes
There are unknowns in the predictions around climate change so there needs to be flexibility around dealing with these. Every day

we encounter new information how CC is impacting in a way we have never thought about it. But it needs to change only pro
environment not economy-related etc.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
with the impacts of climate change happening more frequently we need better plans and policies in dealing with these issues.
Therefore we need more understanding of the science of these effects eg on our biodiversity, and human health to better deal with

them.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
Notes

This issue affects everyone and in particular the already disadvantaged in communities more. It is therefore wise to share information
and support




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

I am involved in a very progressive local community gardenand an active Transition Towns Pt Chevalier member where we discuss CC
issues and trying to do our informed bit as much as we can - we could have a bigger impact if govt sets targets and we are enabled

to recruit more people on board to help reach these targets on an individual/household local basis. I am actively involved in activities
with the group to support sustainable living practices. I also feel we as a quite wealthy country must address some of the excessive

damage we have created to climate change that is affecting our Pacific Island neighbours who are suffering the most and have been
minimal emitters. It is because of these interests and social concerns and my concern for the planet and for future generations that I

fully support the Green Party in its aim to pass the Zero Carbon Act as proposed. My partner and I don't have children and are in our
mid-late 50s, we could just go ahead, enjoy our live and fcku up the planet as there's no blood-relative coming after us - but that's not
how we think, we want as many people as fit healthily on this earth without living over its boundaries to enjoy the one life they are

given - just as we are allowed to.
