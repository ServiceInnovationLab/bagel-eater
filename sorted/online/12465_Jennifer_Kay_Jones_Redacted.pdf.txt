Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Reference no: 12465

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes
 Targets need to be set sooner than 2050 and different targets and dates may be needed for different sectors. For example electricity

 generation should be sooner and agricultural later. Large agricultural processors such as Fonterra should be grouped with industrial
 and be in the soon to medium group. Fonterra has signalled willingness to comply and for example to switch from coal fired milk
 powder driers to using wood waste but is stalling on the implementation date. They need to be pushed. There need to be national

 and regional targets and coordination with local government especially at a regional level. This is practical as much as policy but
 unless there is a realistic blueprint for action and National and Regional Policy Statements and teeth to enforce it, this won't happen.

 You say "The Government is committed to this. Incorporating te ao Māori (the Māori world view) and kaitiakitanga (the concept of
 guardianship) in our approach, as well as working with industry across the agriculture, forestry, energy, transport and waste sectors,
 will help to get the transition right. " This needs to be expanded to include a specific local government dimension as they have

 knowledge and capacity but lack clear guidance.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes
 The plan shouldn't just emphasise reduction in emissions although that would be good but should also look at realistic absorption

 and conversion of emissions. More plants fewer dairy intensifications, Moe protection of the environment and natural ecosystems.
 Rivers can't absorb carbon dioxide if they're dead through toxic pollution and eutrophication and excess algal blooms. Attention
 needs to be given to the whole ecosystem.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 Carbon credits have been shown to be unrealistic. Even with good intentions they frequently fail and are not worth the investment.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 But only in a stronger faster way. 2050 is too far away for some sectors and 2030 and 2040 should be targets for industry and for

 transport. 2050 should be for agriculture only.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

Notes
But only for agriculture.




Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

I would prefer (a) a Carbon tax (b) credits for positive actions eg walking or cycling (c) use of NZ based initiatives only and no
international credit purchasing. Possibly extended to include NZ co-partnered initiatives in the Pacific for future life projects eg floating

islands when current small Pacific nations like Tuvalu go under. Stories on international credits suggest they're inherently unsound
due to shifting political and conflict situations. NZ has the capacity to reverse dairy intensification and look seriously into alternative
plantings for better GHG emission profile. Agriculture is important and high quality value add means beef and lamb have a future as

does A+ milk but bulk milk powder is losing economic value. Our overall climate strategy for agriculture needs to account for market
shifts. The CCC should be able to take both a big picture and look at what Government can influence in New Zealand.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

If you don't have deadlines nothing happens.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Three main sectors for targets are transport, industry including electricity generation, and agriculture. Main co-partners in transport
and infrastructure are local authorities who have many responsibilities but lack clear direction. Infrastructure, transport and

development planning currently lacks a requirement to consider climate impacts in approving work. There is the option under the
Resource Management Act to issue National and Regional Policy Statements but this is underused. The Climate Commission should

develop guidance, possibly for regulation, on how to assess development proposals for long term costs both in how they would
contribute to problems eg Wellington Airport Runway extension adding to climate issues, and in responding to climate related issues
like sea level rise and coastal erosion eg Shelly Bay development including new coastal roads likely to be prone to storm damage.

With regard to Land Transport issues, here are points I made to the Productivity Commission| Overall I support the proposed
approach which could have significant impacts for New Zealanders. Seeing what happens next will give us insights into whether the

Government will follow the Transport Strategy with other changes in response to environmental and economic challenges facing us.
In this respect my thinking is influenced by the recent Productivity Commission Report on getting to a Low-emissions economy, and

recent columns by Rod Oram such as this. 1 General Land Transport Transport infrastructure and modes of transport are needed to
get people and goods to where they need to go. Effective transport options enables communities, individuals and businesses to be

connected and thrive. Failure in networks and services can be catastrophic for those relying on them. 2 Public Transport I strongly
support the focus on public transport. Key elements to public services are affordability, reliability and convenience. People who are
older, or younger, or with families, or are disabled, rely on public transport more than those with other options. Their needs should be

prioritised in planning changes and provision to services. Someone who is blind or vision impaired or in a wheelchair may travel short
distances under their own power but for distance travel most will rely on public transport. In some cases this will include taxi services

but these are limited. Uber has regularly refused to transport disabled passengers. I strongly support the shift in funding away from
new roads towards safer roads and more public transport and more infrastructure. 3 Cycling and Walking I strongly support the shift in

funding to provide more infrastructure for cycling and walking and would welcome a policy focus, especially at local government level,
on removing barriers that prevent people from cycling or walking. Enabling people to bring the bicycle on a bus or train would let more
people use them, especially when train stations or bus stops are not within easy walking distance of a commuter's home. 4 Health As

well as reducing air pollution, a shift from using fossil fueled vehicles to other modes of transport will have additional benefits
especially for public and individual health. These include reduction in diseases associated with a sedentary lifestyle, greater

psychological wellbeing from contact with others in the community and from being mobile and getting fresh air and gaining outdoors
exposure including better vitamin D levels from sunshine, fewer road traffic accidents and affordable access to transport. The cost of

health services could be reduced if transport related causes such as respiratory ailments from air pollution were reduced, as well as
fitness improvements reducing needs in cardiovascular and sedentary lifestyle ailments. If health co-benefits and co-harms of

transport proposals were factored into cost-benefit analyses, the result could see more investment in active and public transport,
and less investment in private motor vehicle oriented transport. A greater focus on safety and reducing road traffic accidents should
result from a mode shift from cars to public transport and walking. 5 Disability and Accessibility Issues People who are older, or

younger, or with families, or are disabled, rely on public transport more than those with other options. Their needs should be
prioritised in planning changes and provision to services. Someone who is blind or vision impaired or in a wheelchair may travel short

distances under their own power but for distance travel most will rely on public transport. In some cases this will include taxi services
but these are limited. Uber has regularly refused to transport disabled passengers. Public transport, and clear reliable

communications about services, are essential for many individuals whether travelling to work, study or on personal matters. Anyone
who becomes disabled through accident may not until that time realise how dependent they are. 6 Climate Action New Zealand's
work on meeting its climate obligations will benefit from increased use of electric powered vehicles, public transport and walking and

cycling. These reduce greenhouse gas emissions from individual fossil fuel powered car use. Transition towards electric vehicle use
and away from fossil fueled vehicles will also help raise awareness of issues and commitment. 7 International Obligations New

Zealand's work on meeting its climate obligations will benefit from increased use of electric powered vehicles, public transport and
walking and cycling. These reduce greenhouse gas emissions from individual fossil fuel powered car use. New Zealand also has a

responsibility to act to support the health of its citizens. Improvements to public and active transport services should be part of this
plan. 8 International Reputation New Zealand relies on its "Clean Green" image for marketing our country as a tourism destination and
for the sale of our agricultural products. Every visitor who shares stories exposing gaps in the reality and every media story criticising

our record can do our reputation harm. This can also impact on the prices we can charge for these products and activities. 9
Economy and Productivity I support the overall direction taken by the Productivity Commission's draft report on transitioning to a low-

emissions economy, including the plan to encourage the replacement of vehicles powered by combustion of fossil fuels with
electricity where feasible. This should include buses. As the Commission says, to help the private sector and civil society plan and

take long-term decisions a stable and credible policy environment is needed. The Government must signal a strong commitment to
the transition, and be clear about its policy intent. This includes a stable and credible climate policy underpinned by:  getting

emissions pricing right, to send the right signals to motivate investment in low emission technologies and processes;  harnessing
the full potential of innovation and supporting investment in low-emissions activities and technologies;  creating laws and
institutions that endure over time and act as a commitment device for future Governments; and  ensuring other supportive

regulations and policies are in place (including to encourage an inclusive transition). A long-term and quantified GHG mitigation target
should be set in law, to clearly signal the direction of travel. Underneath this all-gases target, separate additional mitigation targets

should distinguish between short- and long-lived GHGs because of their different effects on the atmosphere. A series of successive
“emissions budgets” that translate long-term targets into clear, short-to-medium term mitigation targets are also needed. These will

provide visible stepping stones towards the long-term goal. An independent expert body should be created to provide advice to the
Government on these emissions budgets and other matters, and to regularly assess New Zealand’s progress towards its goals.
IMHO this independent expert capacity could be incorporated into a Climate Commission. New Zealand’s transport network is

dominated by private road transport. Compared to other developed countries, vehicle ownership rates are high, public transport use
is low, and the vehicle fleet is old with poor fuel economy. Transport is one of the main sectors where deep emissions reductions are

both necessary and possible given existing and emerging technology. Electric vehicles (EVs) offer a major mitigation opportunity, but
a faster uptake is needed. The Government should encourage EVs and other low-emissions vehicles by introducing a “feebate”

scheme (where vehicle importers either pay a fee, or receive a rebate, depending on the emissions intensity of the vehicle), providing
funding support for EV infrastructure, and encouraging government agencies to procure low-emissions vehicles. Regulating fossil-

fuel vehicle imports will be required to avoid New Zealand becoming a dumping ground for old technology. Emissions standards for
new and used imported vehicles will help to avoid this risk. The Government should also put emissions-reduction goals more
centrally in government transport planning. A low-emissions electricity system that keeps the lights on New Zealand’s low-emissions

transition will rely on abundant and cheap renewable electricity. But there are trade-offs between cost, emissions, and security of
supply in the electricity system. Given current technology, it could be very expensive to completely eliminate GHG emissions from

electricity because of the need to have backup generation (currently supplied by fossil fuels) for those years when it does not rain
enough to fill up the hydro lakes. Eliminating this backup generation entirely would likely raise electricity prices and discourage users

of fossil fuels in other areas of the economy from switching to renewable electricity. New technologies such as tidal power may
emerge over time, while existing technologies such as wind power and battery storage are likely to become more cost-effective. But
it is still uncertain what paths these technologies will take. The emissions price in the NZ ETS should drive investment in electricity

generation, rather than the Government favouring particular technologies, or setting stringent targets for electricity-sector emissions.
Recommendations: 1 In order to increase safety on roads, and improve progress on New Zealand's low carbon goals, the speed

limits on our roads should be reviewed and reduced if appropriate. In particular, increases on some highways to 110km/hour should
be reversed as this normalises higher speeds and according to NZTA's Safer Driving website a vehicle travelling at 110km/hr uses on

average 25% more fuel than if it were travelling at 90Km/hr. City and suburban speeds should also be reviewed downwards in areas
where safety is a concern. Speeds near schools and early childhood centres should be reduced to 30km/hour. There is a strong

argument for reducing speed in most large urban environments to 30 or 40 km/hr. 2 Under Environment ("reduces the adverse
effects on the climate, local environment and public health") should be a key strategic priority (like safety and access), rather than a
supporting one. 3 In relation to Funding and Investment Decisions, I recommend a more outcome focused approach to provide a "a

mode neutral approach to transport planning and investment decisions" (p23), rather than allocating funding by Activity Classes 4
The high level of funding for state highway improvements should focus on safety and connecting communities, rather than in

increasing capacity for speeding by private vehicles. We should have quality two lane roads, four lane passing sections, and bridges
throughout New Zealand together with a network of electric rail, rather than a proliferation of four lane highways. 5 Plan to reflect the

safety implications of how we travel, risks associated with travelling by car are much greater than those in travelling by public
transport. 6 Plans to support smart use of technology with sensors and a range of communication modes. This could be coupled
with congestion charging and parking monitoring. 7 There should be higher priority given to planning for the impact on coastal roads

of coastal erosion and sea level rise, with climate change and future earthquakes like the Kaikoura quake. 8 Develop a specific plan
for how central government and local authorities will work together on these issues, including plans for re-location of individuals and

communities. 9 The Government should plan how to ensure support for households facing significant transition costs. The transition
to a low-emissions economy presents many opportunities, but also challenges, particularly for low-income households. Government

policies could increase the costs of energy, food and transport, which may disproportionately affect these households and which can
be offset through the tax and welfare system. 10 The Government should put GHG emissions-reduction goals more centrally in

government transport planning. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/where-government-plan-new-zealands-land-transport-take-kay-

Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
And more. The Climate Change Commission should have powers to draft regulations possibly in connection with Resource

Management Act setting standards for cost benefit consideration in relation to climate mitigation or adaptation versus overall likely
contribution to climate harms from local authority and transport authority proposals in transport, infrastructure and construction

developments. Do significant housing proposals include an assessment of transport impacts? Are public transport authorities (NZTA
and regional councils) able to increase public transport options to meet demand of new housing development? More details will be

needed but legislation and policy should include framework for how these factors are to be considered. The current transport Benefit
Cost Ratio evaluation model should be expanded to incorporate climate considerations. Economic consultancy Motu could probably

advise on this. Ref https://www.pikb.co.nz/assessment-framework/benefit-and-cost-appraisal/



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes
And more. The CCC should commission work and work with co-partners in service design innovation to better measure and deliver

change. Better use of sensors and monitoring to back up action by other agencies eg on issues like river pollution which has an
impact on climate.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Notes
Yes and No. The list is good but I would prefer more emphasis on the humans in the equation and more openness to contracting in

specific expertise eg on economic models. Understanding Te Ao Maori is essential. So is an understanding of New Zealand's aging
population and shifts in demographics including disability issues for transport and housing considerations. This group should discuss

broad moves with the newly appointed Housing NZ directors who have skills in these areas. Understanding of behavioural economics
"nudge theory" and how to inspire public action is also important. The CCC should be part of leading a revolution in thinking.

Recruiting young leaders such as Laura O'Connell Rapira and Guy Ryan could help lead that charge. Also include data expertise such
as that of Harkanwal Singh and Lilian Grace. Also in dept knowledge of local government with a climate focus. NOT Fran Wilde who got
rid of trolley buses from Wellington. NOT Kerry Prendergast either. Maybe Celia Wade-Brown?




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
Absolutely. Top priority other than targets for sectors of industry, transport and agriculture will be guidance, leadership and support for
local government in adaptation and mitigation. 2/3 of NZers will be affected by rising sea levels. Local authorities need to plan for

coastal routes with erosion and extreme weather threats. Housing and other infrastructure may need to be replaced. Some coastal
towns have no plan. The Insurance Council is keen for action on this and could co-partner in research on priorities.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
Yes but we need more. There should be an All of Government response too. How will Climate Change and Adaptation and Mitigation

affect your portfolio? What ways can each agency support people to get ready for change? The arts community has started grappling
with the mindset shift required. A recent novel by Brannavan Ghanalingham "Sodden Downstream" features a Lower Hutt worker

trying to get to work in Wellington when public transport is stopped by floods. Sound familiar? NZDF's latest Strategic Plan refers to
the need to be ready to act in a Pacific ravaged by climate change and extreme wether events. The CCC could host gatherings of

climate readiness champions from agencies to take joint action. The CCC should have stronger power to act than merely advise. It
should lead and support change, answering to the Minister on its plans.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
Definitely need to share more. Also promote #OpenData and data sharing across agencies! See blog on Digital.govt.nz and

Data.govt.nz for who and what government can share. Technology and intelligent co-design should be part of the solutions explored.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
I'd be happy to participate in follow up actions. Also recommend cross agency works such as that led by DIA Service Innovation Lab in

Optimistic Futures! https://www.optimisticfutures.nz/ and https://www.digital.govt.nz/showcase/exploring-optimistic-futures-
