Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Rebecca Margaret Scott








Reference no: 9877

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 We have already caused a significant level of climate change that is already having devastating effects. We need to set an ambitious
 target, not a watered-down one.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 We should phase out the use of international carbon units. This has been fraught with difficulty and false credits. We need to own our
 own emission reductions, rather than selling our problems to overseas.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 As with all things, we should update practices with new information.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes

 Yes, but only if agreed with my an independent climate commission



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Only with agreement by the a fully independent climate commission.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
But must have mechanisms built in to hold Government to account




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
As a psychologist, I am very interested in the secondary benefits of reducing emissions. Having lived overseas and moved back to NZ

5 years ago, I have been very aware of how the car-centric society of NZ (particularly Auckland where I live) reduces the sense of
community and social connectedness, making it harder to meet one's neighbours, compared to places where people predominantly

walk, cycle or catch public transport. This negatively impacts people's mental health, sense of belonging and safety in their
community. With two small children, I would love to cycle to our local shops (which are too far to walk for preschoolers) but Auckland's

lack of safe cycle infrastructure mean that I feel unsafe to do so. Cycling is wonderful for one's physical and mental health. It is crucial
that this legislation is ambitious and leads to action, not just more talk. NZ was once a progressive country. We can be that again.
