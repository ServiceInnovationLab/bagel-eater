Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 11834

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 Achieving carbon neutrality is a goal that will doubtless require tremendous effort. However, there seems to be an public ignorance
 as to how high the stakes truly are. The urgency of this matter demands an equivalent urgency of New Zealand's action to mitigate

 our carbon emissions.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes
 Aspirational goals often fail to be achieved, as evidenced by the multitude of failed international climate agreements. Carbon is the

 greenhouse gas which stays in the atmosphere the longest and is produced most readily through anthropogenic means. Therefore,
 this should be the focus. However, greenhouse gas emissions are a multifaceted problem and stabilisation of short lived gasses is
 also necessary.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes

 Carbon emission is a worldwide problem. New Zealand must place itself on the forefront of the issue on the world stage. We are in a
 unique position to take a stand and shoulder the burden of climate goals in a way which many developing countries are unable to.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 Carbon neutrality is an absolute priority. Concessions cannot be made for short term economic or political gains.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

This bill must seek to go beyond the changeability of politics. The budgets set will be as much allocations as they are targets to hit.
We cannot afford to make concessions on these emissions. The stakes are far too high.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The views of Iwi must be considered. Te Ao Maori is one of New Zealand's strongest tools in establishing sustainable values. The
effect on the economy, particularly the agricultural and dairy industries will have to be carefully navigated.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
