Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Douglas Black, Douglas William Black










Reference no: 11782


Submitter Type:

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 but target can be made more, but not less, stringent as advised by the Climate Change Commission (CCC)



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 Essential to take a precautionary approach as time is short



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 as a developed country, we must live within our means - less developed countries have less resources than we do to meet per capita
 targets, and our per capita emissions are high



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 but only to make targets more, not less, stringent, by recommendation of the CCC



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 follow the UK model despite different electoral cycle times



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 but the CCC may advise changing the third budget, definitely not the Government



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
not government, but CCC could advise justified adjustments consistent with 2050 target still being achievable




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes
I agree with the Wise Response Society submission here; the current economic(and social) models must adapt to climate change,

not the other way around!



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
with all practicable speed, and not more than 6 months; failure to meet this requirement should be legally enforceable and penalties

base on Heath and Safety legislation applied to government individuals (ministers and civil servants) who (like company directors,
CEOs etc) are found wanting in a judicial review based on the relevant CCC advice considered as from an 'expert witness'



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
I agree with the Wise Response Society's response here; government responses must be precautionary in nature (all practicable

steps), target the "low hanging fruit" first, using only established technologies, and not relying on possible future breakthroughs for
planning.As with Q9 above, this will require the CCC to provide very clear recommendations to facilitate their quick transformation into
funded policy




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
I agree with the Wise Response Society's submission here




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
BUT for a 'Fee and Dividend' scheme, NOT an ETS, as per the Wise Response Society's submission here. We need greater control

over carbon pricing to ensure the 2050 target is met, and all New Zealanders can benefit in the process



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

but must add "values and ethics" as essential, and make 'business competitiveness' merely desirable; see Wise Response Society's
submission here



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

but mitigation must be clearly stated as its principal aim



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Enforcement of the Act needs serious consideration and is not covered by this form. The Productivity Commission's recent report

"Examining the UK Climate Change Act 2008" signals clearly that the UK government is already in breach of the 4th and 5th budget
targets (according to ClientEarth and others), but it is (critically) unclear what legal or other action can be taken to remedy this breach

of the new law.
