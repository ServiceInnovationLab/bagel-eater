Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Amanda Hunt










Reference no: 11934


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 It is essential to differentiate long-lived and short-lived gases (a two basket approach) in developing policies and strategies for

 implementation. In addition, distinguish between fossil methane and biological methane in policies.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 Emissions targets could be brought forward if there is new scientific evidence of what is required for a safe climate.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Yes, but only to increase the speed of emissions reductions.



 Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes â€“ together with the following: to reduce cumulative emissions sufficiently to avoid dangerous climate change, the steepest
emissions cuts to carbon dioxide must occur in the first 10 years, with possibly less steep cuts thereafter



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Reducing emissions as quickly as possible, to mitigate the worsening effects of climate change in the future. Emission reduction rate

should be the primary driver when setting budgets. This should not be watered down because of justifications like 'economic factors',
The reality is there will be no economy either in NZ or worldwide, without dramatic action now to reduce emissions and minimise
effects as much as possible.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Climate change is the biggest threat to human survival and wellbeing and must be the primary consideration in all government and

economic decision-making. It is critical that the provisions in this bill are as strong as possible, and we must not allow the primacy of
this issue to be diluted by the greed,lobbying and shortsightedness of industries that are already denigrating natural capital,
particularly fossil-fuel companies and industrial dairying. As an aunt, I want Aotearoa New Zealand - and the earth - to have a safe

climate future for my niece and nephew (aged 8 and 10) to grow up in . I do not want them growing up to an adulthood of fear,
climate refugees, resource wars and ultimate social collapse.. This is our last chance to take meaningful action on climate change

and reverse previous governments' weak and toothless excuses for action. As figures at the UN have said, "We are the first
generation to feel the effects of climate change, and the last to be able to do something about it". I urge the Government to take as

strong a course of action as possible, and to make the targets and frameworks in the Zero Carbon Act as stringent and ambitious as
possible. Climate change is the main issue I vote on. I have supported formation of this government to take the ambitious action

needed. I urge them to stand strong, to defend the strong provisions set out in the discussion document, and to be courageous.
Please.
