 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
1. Education - research. Educating the public on the science of climate change, some people don't believe it or understand it, some

people think it's the bible being played out, some people don't care - hence incentives. 2. Incentives - encouraging the public to
change, to want to change. For example, providing more public bikes like New York, providing a service/system where people can hire

electric cars, providing a scheme or a tax to further support green options where people that are on a lower income have access to
something like solar panels or an electric car. 3. Technology - research into new technologies and research on electric cars, grants (if

there is spare money available) etc. Look into Plant Biotechnology, for example, some types of Cyanobacteria have a higher hydrogen
content than others. Also, the process of photosynthesis, if replicated in a synthetic environment and works at 100% efficiency, it can
provide another energy source - the sun. 4. Biodiversity - research, looking into how it will affect fauna and flora. Also, in which flora

(trees) to plant and where. 5. Ocean Acidification - where co2 sinks into the ocean, converts to co3 (bicarbonate) and kinda like the
washing powder ad where it munches away at coral and the like (species with calcium carbonate), and increases the hydrogen in the

water, changing it's pH. Research into this area, again with biodiversity also being a factor. 6. International relations - looking into the
way the rest of the world are approaching this issue and use their approaches if it works for New Zealand. It's got to be everyone to

make a difference, it would be nice to see an International Environmental Court set up rather than relying on the International Criminal
Court which doesn't really fit the purpose.
