Reference no: 11773

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes
 I object to this limited set. Use of the word 'net' (allowing offsets) and omission of the word methane (using short-lived gasses)
 makes this question pretty disingenuous. No option here actually allows for Methane to be reduced. Methane impact cannot be

 ignored or side-tracked !! Just offsetting methane emissions and carrying on with the agricultural practice (option 3) is dangerous!! It
 is HALF our GHG emissions - this is HUGE deal. Failure to be clear on surveying for an opinion here is a weakness of this public

 consultation. I fear that many will be mislead by deliberate structure of this question - which seems to intentionally duck the most
 pressing issue alongside timeline - Q/ is 2050 aggressive enough? A - NO - I have checked option 2 because it caps the growth of
 emissions from cattle. There is no option here to insist on an actual reduction of emissions from cattle. There is no question here on

 the aggressiveness of the timeline for change.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 Reliability, audit and integrity of international off-shore carbon sequestration programmes has a long way to go to be TRUSTWORTHY
 as an offset for NZ carbon emitting activity. Keep it onshore until things improve. Set policy to stimulate the domestic afforrestary
 business in New Zealand and compete, rather than enable NZ business to give it away thro' purchase of offshore carbon units.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes

 The only acceptable revision would be to make it more aggressive a timeline to net zero GHG emissions. This Act is and should
 remain apolitical, target softening is not an option.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 Softening targets in any way (such as stratification) is a failure to grasp the magnitude of the global risk and the local impacts that will

 follow. Set the targets and leave them alone.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 Softening targets in any way (such as stratification) is a failure to grasp the magnitude of the global risk and the local impacts that will
follow. Set the targets and leave them alone.




Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes
Softening targets in any way (such as stratification) is a failure to grasp the magnitude of the global risk and the local impacts that will

follow. Set the targets and leave them alone.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
Absolutely necessary - urgency is in fact important, this is not often the case but is undeniable for the carbon act.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Imperative that the critical inclusion of agriculture (specifically dairy) emissions is NOT AVOIDED. Over 50% of our national GHG

emissions are methane. The sector therefore MUST adapt to be part of the transition to a low-carbon economy. Failure to include and
address this enormous driver of GHG generation in the New Zealand will make a mockery of the Carbon Act, and will represent gross

dis-service to future generations, my children included. It is imperative that the Act delivers on this, because it is morally and ethically
the right thing to do - regardless of political and economic optics.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Use a risk based approach to monitoring - where government oversight is applied to areas with the highest risk of failure to comply
with climate goals, coupled to the severity of the risk to climate by non-compliance. Where the drivers to change are weakest,

requires most policing by central agencies.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

The NZ ETS has already been mis-handled and become totally ineffective, handing back ETS policy settings to any elected official is a
mistake. History tell us that the scheme is easily undermined by flip flopping on ETS policy settings. Green washing is the biggest risk

we face, hence any ETS should enable just a small fraction of our commitments. Science and the balance of risk/impact should guide
the degree to which the country should rely upon an ETS mechanism. History tells us we should not rely upon a NZ government to

get the policy settings right, so it becomes an inherently less reliable a choice for the future of the country.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Notes
Mitigation MUST come first - an adaptation bill/act can follow - if it compromises the speed of getting good legislation on a net

reduction of GHG emissions passed into law then it should not be included in the Carbon Act. Adaptation is consequential, the
degree to which this becomes material depends on the success or failure of efforts to mitigate. Make the main thing the main thing
and keep the momentum.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

Adaptation should not be the focus of the act - bias should be heavily to MITIGATION
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

Adaptation should not be the focus of the act - bias should be heavily to MITIGATION



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
METHANE The majority of the 16 questions here concern the proposed climate change commission and how far its powers should

extend. This balance is disturbing. The most contentious question refers to the definition of what “zero carbon” actually means.
Every option indicates a 'net' emission number, signalling that offsets are acceptable. Two scenarios cover all types of GHG which

include methane. Neither allow for the actual reduction of methane. One would allow its growth with offsets, the other would call for
stabilisation of the methane emissions. The question is devious and this is deeply concerning. Without good knowledge the intent of
submissions here can easily be watered down and/or lost. This looks deliberate. Methane cannot be ignored. It cannot be merely

offset, then carrying on with the current practice of cattle/sheep agriculture at scale. Methane It is HALF the problem in NZ and hence
HALF the solution must lie here. Methane emissions need to be cut hard and fast, not stabilised at their present levels, and ducking

this issue will be a disaster for the credibility of the ruling NZ government. As a secondary issue the questions on this topic should
have been transparent and not coded so as to apparently side track the issue. The MAIN issue for New Zealand. OPPORTUNITY NZ

should set an important precedent. New Zealand should become the first country in the world to put a price on agricultural
emissions, academics and published authors and corporates have already done so, nation states are the laggards. Ethically speaking

New Zealand can and should lead the way and MUST include ACTUAL REDUCTIONS in agricultural emissions. LACKS AMBITION The
target date of 2050 for attaining this is woefully inadequate given the risks posed. 2035 seems much more impactful and urgent
timeline for humanity to act decisively given that we are collectively running the risk for our children of catastrophic climate change…
