Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Fergus, Fergus Alexander McCool






Reference no: 2620


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Carbon Dioxide - Reducing net carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2050
 Notes

 I think the inclusion of farming (short lived gasses) will eventually happen however I am concerned about the cost to individual
 farmers. Given agriculture has such a big contribution to our economy, it can be assumed that agri will have a larger share of our total
 emissions. Comparing our agri emissions with other OECD countries is rather pointless.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes

 A larger emphasis must be on new technologies. More funds should be put into the Green Investment Fund do develop new
 technologies to help decrease our emissions. I thing too greater reliance is placed on planting trees. At the end of the day NZ

 produces only 0.17% (2013 figures) of the worlds GHG emissions. If we can develop technologies that can make an impact we may
 be able to help the bigger emitters reduce their emissions which will have a greater overall effect on climate change. I know that
 power companies in Hawkes Bay are charging customers utilising solar energy more because they need to cover their costs of still

 supplying power to these homes. There is therefore no incentive to utilise these technologies. This should change.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
Notes




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
No

Notes
It should be done however a given time frame is not necessary.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
For me personally I believe there needs to be an emphasis on meeting our emissions goals collectively as a country, with collectively

being the key word. I realise that this is only a small part of the whole equation however I am worried about the potential additional
costs for individual farmers to mitigate their emissions.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
I agree with the proposed however believe there should be further emphasis on the modelling of the economic impacts of reducing

GHG emissions to both individuals and industry as a whole.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
Lets keep it simple. Reducing NZ's GHG emissions and adapting to climate change are two different things. Given NZ's contribution

to global GHG emissions is so insignificant, it is highly unlikely any changes we make are going to have an impact on climate change. I
do believe it is important to address climate change however the Zero Carbon Bill is not the right place to include this.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

As I have alluded to above, my main concern is that any new rules implemented are going to be focused on the Agriculture industry. I
realise the contribution agri has to our GHG emissions however given the reliance we have on the Agri sector in terms of our GDP,

this has to be expected. Comparing this to other countries is unhelpful as other countries don't have the reliance on commodity
exports like New Zealand does. In the Appendix of the Consultation document under agriculture is states that land use change to

lower emitting uses will likely be needed to achieve material emissions reductions from agriculture. I find this worrying and hope that
no farmer will be forced to change their system. Sure, if there is voluntary land use change that is fine, however forcing reductions
through capping cow numbers etc should not be an option. I know I have stated that I believe too high a reliance is placed on the

planting of trees however this is a key part of reaching our targets. In the appendix under forestry is states that "forestry helps buy us
time until other technological developments or option become available". This already sounds like a Band-Aid solution to a problem.

However, farmers should be able to use techniques such as planting areas and retiring areas as a means of mitigating their
emissions.
