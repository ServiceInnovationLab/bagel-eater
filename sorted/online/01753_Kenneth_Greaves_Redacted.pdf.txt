 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 If it is passed , A revision clause for raising or lowering must be in the legislation. As the science has not been proved 100% and is
 based on models that have changed . ie United Nationsâ€™ climate models that have proven to be grossly inaccurate for over twenty

 years - models used by former US Vice President Al Gore and the UN Environmental Programme to claim that sea level rise would
 engulf cities around the world and create 50 million climate refugees by 2010!
