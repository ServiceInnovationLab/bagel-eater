Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill








Reference no: 2495


Submitter Type:

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 Having a set and immovable target is fundamental to the efficacy of this piece of legislation. Without a set target there are too many
 moving pieces and too much wiggle room between the Commission's recommendations and the governments actions. The point of
 the Act is to hold the government to account throughout a period of time, if the time period is movable so too is the accountability.

 The target should be zero net carbon, because it is ambitious but achievable.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 While I don't think overseas credits should be used, if they are, the Commission needs to be able to hold the government to account

 for the quality of the credits.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Circumstances should be specific and tied to scientific evidence that a different approach is warranted.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 This will allow planning over time. Additionally, the Commission should have the ability to comment on whether a previous

 government's actions have lead to increases or decreases in carbon emissions in the following terms.



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Significant weight needs to be given to the Crown's duty under the Treaty of Waitangi and how climate change will impact the ability of

 MƒÅori to perform their kaitiaki role. Both the Commission and the Crown need to have the expertise to be able to properly consider
 these matters fully.



 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

 Position
Yes

Notes
If the Act is not mandatory with clear timeframes it will not be an effective tool for holding the government to account.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Iwi and hapu views. Scientific community.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
The Commission needs to play a strong and public role. It must have the ability to hold the government of the day to account and

must be independent.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Also needs specific expertise in ensuring that changes do not disproportionately affect minorities or the poor.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

This Act needs to provide the Commission with a strong and central role and must have all powers necessary to hold government
(and potentially commercial players, through reporting requirements) to account. It should be able to commission its own research

and seek information from the government.
