Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Marcus (J N M) Williams








Reference no: 11907

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 According to 'accepted science' zero carbon is not negotiable. The questions are when, and how to get global commitment? Any
 failure will lead to inevitable global catastrophe.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 By adopting new energy efficiencies and recognising (counting) all carbon sequestration - especially in the soil and in every tree
 planted and growing in the country. This is critical - please see expanded notes at end:




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 The Government needs flexibility to deal with changing circumstances and respond to changing global priorities.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 As an instrument of evaluating progress.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes
 see previous notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

This is a global issue. All governments need to work together to the same end.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

The ETS has serious shortcomings which must be addressed. As stated elsewhere- all emissions must be accounted for, not just
the conveniently countable ones.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

Zero carbon is about climate change.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
The concept outline below suggests constructive ideas as to how and why carbon is far more important than just climate change -

and ways to achieve that. ShelterForest: - A solution for some of the most critical challenges facing mankind in the 21st century:
Significant elements: - Climate change, costs, consequences, and carbon implications; ShelterForest outlined; Global topsoil

degeneration and implications; Opportunities from trees and shelter; Ramial chipped wood - an answer to sequestration and soil
degeneration; Hydraulic redistribution – a previously unrecognised quality of many trees; The imperative to include shelter in carbon

calculations; Introduction: Our planet is in the process of exceeding its capacity to support the rampantly expanding human
population and the demands from increasing consumerism. Major challenges include climate change, loss of topsoil, and,
increasingly challenged water resources, - factors all addressed by ShelterForest. Climate change currently has a significant political

profile. Calculations suggest the current annual global cost of climate change at US$140 billion although, given global climatic events
during Aug/Sept 2017, this figure might be dramatically understated. Financial, economic and loss of life costs can be expected to

increase exponentially in line with recent trends. The most immediate response to global warming is to reduce levels of atmospheric
CO2. The pragmatic way of achieving this is by the planting of trees. Unfortunately, planting forests also conflicts with increasing

demands for food – or do they? ShelterForest (SF) accommodates this conflict by proposing planting large numbers of trees in ways
which increase land productivity, reduce the impact of climate change, and provide additional opportunities and benefits. The
concept: ShelterForest proposes planting of 20% of all land in trees in the form of shelter belts of some 20 metre or so width. Shelter

belts thus become belts of forest rather than single lines of trees by growing several rows (say 3) of harvestable lumber trees inter-
planted with understory plants, all chosen for multiple purposes and functions, including rotational harvest. The shelter value of the

plantings alone will more than compensate for the land taken out of production in most, if not all, situations. These benefits will be
even more significant with the advent of increasingly extreme weather predicted by global warming. While a primary objective of

ShelterForest is to combat the causes and consequences of climate change, the most immediate benefit will be in the economic
value of shelter will begin within months of being planted and grow rapidly thereafter. Growing trees sequester carbon, both through

their own biomass and into the surrounding soils, thus contributing to soil regeneration. In addition, there are other benefit
opportunities with profound implications including environmental, economic and sustainability. ShelterForest design process: SF is
achieved through a design process considering a complex range of factors, possibilities, and outputs. All farmland should be

included, especially productive flats and ‘easy’ land. The starting point for each site would be an in-depth analysis of relevant factors
including geology, geography, prevailing winds, sun orientation, climate, existing structures including established trees, waterways

etc. Plant selection would consider plant functions, characteristics, their relationship with each other and the environment as well as
resource, harvest, and other considerations. Such might include the use of deciduous trees to enable sun penetration during winter

and early spring months whilst retaining significant shelter function. Understory shrubs would provide livestock protection against
adverse weather during winter. The Value of Shelter: The economic benefits of shelter are all too often little recognised. A passage
was noted in an American journal a number of years ago which suggested: - If you plant 20% of your land in trees, productivity on the

remaining 80% will increase by 80%. This was more recently reinforced by the reported experience at Windwhistle – a name inspired
by environmental circumstances - in Canterbury, NZ - where it was observed that when shelter was planted “productivity increased

by more than 60%”. These observations suggest that the productivity value of shelter alone in most situations will provide gains well
in excess of any perceived loss of production from the area planted in trees. Shelter is an essential part of many permanent crops. It
seems likely that for most, if not all other farming activities, the economic value of shelter is little understood and/or has not been fully

evaluated. The mechanics of shelter: The immediate value of shelter is reduced wind. Within the zone immediately behind shelter,
wind speed is reduced by about 80%. At a distance 10 times the vertical height of the shelter, wind speed will be reduced in the

order of 30% to 50%. Thus, shelter of height 30m will have significant downwind benefits for more than 300m, coincidentally also
benefiting the next ShelterForest belt. Reduced wind means reduced stress on both animals and plants and reduced loss of water

from evaporation. Wind-chill increases the energy (food) requirement of livestock and can have particularly devastating, even fatal
consequences, particularly when accompanied by cold rain. Heat can also be a source of stress which can be accentuated by direct
sun and by high temperature winds (the other end of the wind-chill factor). Skin temperatures on dark animals have been measured

upwards of 50oC. Trees beyond shelter: Trees have been critical to the development of life on planet Earth. They have been integral
to the development of man since he began using fire and making tools. Today they are still essential for many building structures and

industries and provide a huge biomass resource which is also a natural alternative to many fossil resource requirements, Many trees
have extraordinary value as livestock fodder - nutrition and health from leaves, twigs, bark, and fruits, - food for bees (an increasingly

threatened element of reliable food supply), food and environmental support for wildlife and natural predators etc. They are essential
for erosion control on steep hills and along river banks. A significant aspect of SF is that, through the design process, mature trees
can be harvested on a rotational basis with minimal impact on the functional integrity of the shelter. Slash from harvested trees can

be an energy or alternative biomass resource, and/or, chipped as a resource for regenerating topsoil (see RCW below). Many leaves,
and even the bark from some trees are highly nutritious and naturally sought after by livestock. The harvest and by-products from SF

will provide new economic and sustainability opportunities for the land and its owners as well as increased opportunities for
meaningful employment. Carbon sequestration: Estimates suggest that about 30% of the current excess carbon in the atmosphere

originated from degrading soils. Trees naturally sequester carbon. Climate change is a serious challenge and but soil degeneration
may be an even more critical. We need to return carbon to the soil for the regeneration of organic biomass and soil fertility. As soon as

trees begin to grow they accumulate carbon from the atmosphere, both below and above ground. It has now been shown that
carbon levels in the ground increase as you get closer to trees, likely through natural leaf and twig litter and other biological
processes. Most of the world’s fertile topsoils were formed by natural forest litter. Satellite technology can now measure every

significant tree canopy on the planet. It is particularly important that these are all recognised as every ton of C is relevant, especially if
we (the tax payer) are paying for carbon credit deficits. Every tree contributes to carbon sequestration and long-term sustainability.

The soil resource (or deficit): The soils of the world are being degraded at an alarming rate with loss of soil biomass (carbon) a major
factor. University of Sydney Professor John Crawford says that current projections of topsoil degradation suggest that within the next

50 years our planet will produce 30% less food with a population demanding 50% more. This equates to a projected food deficit in
the order of 50%. Trees, particularly in the form of ShelterForest, provide an extraordinary answer to this dilemma, in part through the
potential of Ramial Chipped Wood: Ramial Chipped Wood (RCW): < http://forestgeomat.for.ulaval.ca/brf > Research began at Laval

University, Quebec, in the late 1970s as a result of large piles of slash left after logging operations. Over 20 years of research
produced positive, if not astounding, results with two in particular illustrating the potential; strawberries in Quebec and tomatoes in

Senegal producing yield increases of 300% and 1000% respectively. Fertile topsoil is a critical ingredient for high yielding crops.
Throughout evolution plants and trees have been essential to the formation of topsoil. We now have the understanding and the

technology to dramatically enhance this natural process and begin to repair the damage done by global deforestation and modern
farming practices. Perhaps the greatest opportunity from RCW is to sequester carbon into soil in a process which could have

profound implications for the lives of billions of people within the next generation or so. Mobile technology is already available which
can chip trees at up to 90 tons/hr - the limiting factor being access to raw tree material. This equates to 180,000 tonnes every year
for each chipping unit. With SF, such material would be grown and processed on site eliminating most transportation and further

processing costs. Another opportunity arising from this concept is that lower grade RCW+, (RCW is defined as having a diameter less
than 7cm) could be chipped by the same equipment, either as a bulk resource (such as energy) or as an expanded resource of

woodchip for sequestration. RCW offers a process which enables recovery from the massive global deforestation over recent history
and subsequent soil degeneration by providing organic material to regenerate topsoils and enhance land productivity. Composting is

long considered a fundamental of good gardening. (It is the natural process of forest litter.) RCW expands that concept to a new level
of practicable possibility. The place for trees today is as an integral part of all conventional farming rather than, or as well as,
conventional forestry. Water: In addition to reduced evaporation resulting from shelter, increased biomass in soils will further benefit

water challenges by increasing the water absorption and retention. This should be of special interest in the light of anticipated
increasing weather extremes from global warming. Organic soil matter can hold 20 times its own weight in water. Hydraulic

Redistribution: This is an extraordinary quality recognised in a report from UC Berkeley in 2005. Upwards of 60 tree species were
recognised as ‘dumping’ water at the bottom of their roots at wet times and releasing it back into surface soils during dry times. This

has the benefit of alleviating stress on the plants during both flood and drought. Back to the future: Mention the concept of planted
forests and the immediate thought is of large areas of single specie trees. This continues the modern experiment of mono-culture

which clearly challenges our planet’s natural evolutionary biology. SF invites a revisit of the concept of ‘forest’ and consideration
towards more natural integrated biological systems. These will prove to be more productive, much more sustainable and less risky
than the intensive monocultural farming methods which currently prevail. ShelterForest will, at planting, begin the many and complex

contributions to a more viable and sustainable future, contributions which will grow year by year. Marcus Williams
