Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Michelle Ducat








Reference no: 12894

Submitter Type:

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 We need bold action to get to net Zero well before 2050 to do our fair share and model the kinds of changes needed to give more
 than a 50% probability of staying well below 2 degreed.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 As above - this needs to be earlier, and all gases need to be included as the extra warming effects of methane could contribute to

 the exacerbation of feedback mechanisms life release of methane from the permafrost. This decision needs to be guided by science.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 We need significant gross emissions cut without recourse to overseas units. Domestic emissions must include shipping and air
 transport. Focusing on domestic emissions does not mean we do not look to support other countries with their emissions

 reductions.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 But not to a less ambitious target, and only guided by science. We have a small window of opportunity to make a difference to those
 most at risk now and in the future.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
I largely agree but economic competitiveness is the least relevant and potentially most dangerous: business has used this to drag

the chain on climate action for decades in NZ. The current profit driven economic model dependent on extractive growth creates
vested interests in the status quo. A just transition is important.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

Driven by science, working with fairness and justice in mind.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Science - what rates of emissions cuts will most likely demonstrate a fair contribution to keeping us well below 2 degrees. The people
who are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
