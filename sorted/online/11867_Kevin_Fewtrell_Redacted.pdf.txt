Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Kevin Fewtrell









Reference no: 11867

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes

 There should be no target as the science is not proven and you can't set a target for something that is not quantifiable.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 As above. A target is not quantifiable as the science is not settled.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Notes
 As we are less than 1% of global emissions there should be no targets.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Notes
 Again there should be no targets.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 No. There is no evidence that taking money off of NZ Taxpayers will affect in any way Climate Change or global warming. It is a natural
 occurring phenomena.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes

 There is no need for a budget of any kind.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Notes
 No. As Above.



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Notes
 There should be no considerations as there should be no budget for Climate Change. NZ Citizens come first not some virtue
 signalling drivel from the Paris Accords which is a failed exercise.



 Clause

 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Notes

There should be NO Emissions Budgets. It is a sham.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Putting NZ Citizens first. Not a virtue signalling exercise in which the Biggest Polluters are not signatories to and have no intention of
becoming. Why hurt NZer's for absolutely no reason other than as a sop to the Green Party.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
No. It is a waste of a $Billion dollars annually that is better spent in NZ.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Notes
None it is not needed.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
It will become another bureaucracy peopled by troughers on another gravy train.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes

It is a natural event that has been continuously happening since the planet formed. It is a needless Bill/Legislation.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

There is nothing the Govt can do that will change anything except to hurt Taxpayers needlessly.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes

There is no need as this Bill and supporting infrastructure is not needed. The science is not settled.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
This is nothing more than a Virtue Signalling exercise that will do more harm to NZ Taxpayers in lost revenues ($1Billion Annually to

start) than if that money was kept in NZ and spent here. It is nothing more than a sop to the NZ Green Party in a minority Govenment
that would sell NZ Taxpayers down the river to stay in power. A disgrace. The Zero Carbon Bill should be abandoned forthwith. It is

meaningless.
