Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 11404

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes
 Ideally, it should happen sooner than 2050 if scientific research and planned, strategic implementation is started and phased in in

 stages.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 AS KIWIS, we all have to take responsibility to stand on our own merits and not 'borrow' from others. A longer term environmental
 vision that has home-based solutions is the only way forward. Share best practices across all sectors - podcasts - everyone has to

 get on board with this and do it in an informed way.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 Yes...especially if the ongoing monitoring of data is revealing issues not yet envisioned...and targets need to be tightened/raised to
 meet realistic needs.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 The emissions budget needs to be monitored by an independent commission in consultation with the govt...but the goals and vision

 needs to be kept out of any particular political party's agenda.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
Yes

Notes
Only if backed up by veritable research by a partisan group with no vested self-interest.




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Build consultation capacity from experts from a wide range of expertise - fiscal - economic - scientific - conservationists - academics in
specific fields - farming sector - forestry- offshore experts who have already been involved in a similar process - all finding cost-

effective but robust ways of moving forward. Money also needs to be set aside to encourage robust innovative practices - especially
in the farming/agriculture sectors.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Definitely - an independent group with no underlying vested interest. It needs to be given 'teeth' to follow through with achieving

visionary but attainable goals.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes
To spend so much money on setting up an independent body of experts, and not give them 'authority' to act on decisions, is a

'waste' of tax payers; money.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

See response to question 12.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes
We are still learning about the projected effects of climate change on our waterways - coastal shores etc - la nina - el nino. The Bill

has to take this into consideration as it sets and revises targets.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
As long as this is carried out as a cooperative not competitive model and good practice is shared - supported etc



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Share good news stories about good practices with the public (e.g. website with podcasts)- provide incentives to encourage ever-
friendly practices (e.g. 1970s?? - govt subsided grant to install solar panel etc) . 90% of New Zealanders line within 50kms of a

coastline. With rising sea-levels - more frequent flooding and cyclones- more intense storm surges - no one can be complacent any
more. Be brave in your thinking and your approach to change for the better.
