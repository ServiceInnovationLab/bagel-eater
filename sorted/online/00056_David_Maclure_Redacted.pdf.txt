 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 No

 Notes



 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

 Clause
 12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

 Unit are very complicated matters really.




 Clause
 Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
 Notes

 I am not impressed that low income household hit the hardest under the current proposal should not be affected due limit on income
 as no need to impose like this. Low income household should be able to request right to exemptions if hardship become evidently.
 Not without consultation with low Income communities first.
