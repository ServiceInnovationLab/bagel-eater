Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

mary Morgan-Richards, Mary Morgan-Richards










Reference no: 1685


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later

 Notes
 A target for net-zero carbon emissions before 2030 should be in the Act



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 To reduce the rate of global warming we need to consider all contributions to heating the climate



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes
 Emissions budgets should be at least as important as fiscal budgets, and the Government should set plans to achieve them




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

The emissions from transport, industrial activity, agriculture, and all other sources should be included in the target. Even ‘short-lived’
gasses can have a huge effect on our climate and need to be reduced.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The climate of the whole globe must be considered. Sea level rising must be considered, and all the people in a Pacific who will suffer.

Emissions budgets should be at least as important as fiscal budgets, and the Government should set plans to achieve them



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
An independent Climate Change Commission of experts should monitor emissions and give advice to keep New Zealand on-track for

its emissions reduction goals



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

We must act soon. We as New Zealanders must take our share of responsibility for the current crisis. The emissions of green-house
gasses per person in New Zealand is one of the highest in the world. Every company and organization and individual must be taxed
so that the burden of reduction-cost is shared equally. Changes must start immediately.
