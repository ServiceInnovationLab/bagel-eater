Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Jim, Jim & Audrey Walker








Reference no: 12641

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 Actions must be led by a bipartisan and scientific approach to ensure certainty.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived

 gases
 Notes
 To deal with CO2 only would not be accepted by the community at large due to the unfortunate perception that the Ag industry is

 largely responsible for all our problems. This is obviously not the case as the short term gas Methane and Co2 are quite different in
 their source and in our ability to deal with Methane without major disruption to our rural communities and export industry. To go to Net

 Zero emission in all gases would devastate our rural communities as it would totally kill off our pastoral farming systems and the
 infrastructure around them and associated jobs right across the economy. The proposal to increase forestry planting in rural areas
 coming on top of pressures to reduce methane or Nitrous Oxide emissions could create a collapse of our rural resilience. Forestry

 has always been an exploitive industry and seldom gives back to the communities. It can be a social and cultural black hole. We
 should remember we are dealing with these problems primarily for the better survival of human race. The human race means, at its
 grassroots level, communities of people and we should remember that. We favour the second option. It will achieve the desired CO2

 reduction plus see a lowering of atmospheric Methane and Nitrous Oxide levels due to sciences yet to be developed. It is noted that
 the Sheep & Beef sector has been making headway in producing less carbon intensive products already. We do not favour Methane

 from ruminant animals being included in the ETS. Better to work hard on solutions to lower Methane production via vaccination or diet
 supplements combined with genetics. These things are happening now and are unlikely to be improved or speeded up by the
 bureaucracy and cost of having Methane in the ETS. We would like to see the language used to measure progress against targets

 changed under the new bill. For instance to use a pie graph showing Ag contributing over 50% of total emissions is meaningless and
 unhelpful and will only get worse over time as CO2 is lowered. Better to talk only of progress towards targets eg Agriculture 1990-
 2014 + 15% Energy 1990-2014 + 36%




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes
 This option allows for international co-operation which may be important.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Targets and budgets should always be reviewable rather than allowed to drift. Technology may even allow targets to be lifted.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
Clause
6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

Position
Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

Notes
Budgets should always be reviewable. That is what budgets are for.




Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Communities and their resilience




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Yes, we need a panel of widely varied expertise.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes
An independent role maybe alongside the Reserve Bank and Treasury.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Ensure expertise needed on community resilience eg land use changes.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes
Yes needs some central coordination.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Adaptation is always important.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
Provided that it does not end up just another Bureaucratic cost centre.
