Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Patrick, Patrick Reynolds Photography Ltd





Reference no: 12396

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Notes

 It should be able to be accelerated but not weakened. If political parties can run on winding iyt back then all sorts of stalling and
 minimising could be encouraged.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes

 unsure how much flexibility is ideal; trade-off between predictability and agility...?



 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 This could be useful. For example the Bill could set out reducing per capital private vehicle kilometres travelled for NZTA and regional
 transport agencies and authorities to achieve in their transport and land use budgets and plans.



 Clause

 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
 Notes

 NZTA, AT, MoT, local authorities and all other transport and land use powers. As above, a key area to work with in the transition to a
 post carbon economy is transport. Here public agencies and authorities have a huge influence, and firm targets should be set to
 guide them to invest in the best way to accelerate the transition. Going post carbon must be the third key priority after safety and

 access.
Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
I see advantages in the Commission being separate and making binding decisions. It is important to try to make this as a-patry

political as possible. Ideally all sides of the House should have a role in setting it up and have buy in as it needs to be consistent way
beyond any election cycle.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes
see above.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
But also consider adding agriculture and transport specialists...?



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Notes

Maybe. Difficult question; would that a) add to its work load, and b) confuse its aims from purely reducing harm? Though adaptaion
will become increasingly necessary regardless of success in reducing emissions.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
