Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill











Reference no: 8207

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 The problem has been avoided too long and the risks are now too great – we need to go for the boldest possible action as soon as
 possible, and invest in research and development to find news ways of living and working.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 Moving the problem around the planet won't help – we all share the same atmosphere. Let's do whatever we can do here.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 It should be allowed to be made bolder if change accelerates faster than expected. It shouldn't be allowed to be softened up – these

 changes are needed for the world ongoing anyway.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
We need to consider poverty and lifestyle. We'll need to push hard for investment into new technology/building and insulation

rules/public transport and especially ways of farming (permaculture, reforestation, no-till agriculture etc) to offset the negative affects
of reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and traditional farming/dairying. Insulating homes and introducing passive house techniques

will be important. Could the KiwiBuild scheme have a role to play here?



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes
As long as the commission doesn't end up stacked with business interests or lobbyists.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

Please make those advising on economics have a broader range of ideas than the usual neoliberal economists. I would love to see
NZ take a world leadership position on introducing a new form of economic thought that takes into account care work and the

environment, such as doughnut economics.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
For the first time in a long time, I'm hopeful for my children's future. We have a unique opportunity as a small island nation to be real

leaders here - I hope we take it boldly and change the world in all of our favour.
