Notes
This submission is to note my total opposition to the Zero Carbon Bill and the concepts it contains. I submit that: 1. The Zero Carbon

Bill is a total nonsense driven by a radical uninformed agenda that has the potential to bring our Nation to its’ knees. 2. Economic
forecasts point out that the economy will be radically worse off and up to a quarter smaller. 3. The forecasts show that the burden will

fall disproportionately on lower income households which is not tenable. 4. Modelling shows that NZ’s major earning sectors such as
sheep, beef, and dairy farming economic output could be halved. This makes no sense. 5. The Zero Carbon Bill fails dismally by not

recognising the true impact of moving to ‘green technologies such as wind and solar power. Once a 'Whole of Life Cycle Analysis' is
carried out the impact of manufacturing these items demonstrates a gross negative cost in terms of cost and emissions. The use of

steel and other resources makes a nonsense of the ‘green technology claim.sss 6. The facts do not support the concept of taxing
Methane. It is known that Methane is short-lived in the atmosphere. Without methane, New Zealand would have one of the smallest
greenhouse gas emissions profiles in the developed world. It hangs around for about 10 years before it is converted to CO2. 7.

Livestock are carbon neutral and thus methane from agriculture should not be included in emissions targets. For every unit of carbon
the animal emits as CH4 it must ingest the same amount of carbon from its plant-based feed source, which, comes initially from the

CO2 in the atmosphere. The animal is both the source of the carbon in methane and it is also the sink for the equivalent amount of
carbon in CO2. In this sense the carbon-methane cycle - methane-to-CO2-to-forage-plants-to-animals-to-methane - is a closed cycle.

The animal is CH4-carbon neutral. 8. The Bill makes no mention of the increased Methane emissions from the massive Government
Tree Planting Policy. Trees emit Methane thus if methane is included the Government Policy and the Bill are in direct contradiction. In
summary in my opinion the Zero Carbon Bill as proposed is a huge hoax, and will only drive the economy into a downward spiral.
