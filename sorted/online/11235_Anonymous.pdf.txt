Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill







Reference no: 11235

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 It is important that New Zealand sets the most ambitious target possible. Net Zero emissions is ambitious, but it is also entirely
 achievable. In order to meet the goal of less than 2 degrees of warming, it is important that all nations try to get as close to net zero

 emissions as soon as possible.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 "Escape clauses" should not be written into the Act. There needs to be a firm commitment from the Government on these issues,

 and sectors need to have clarity on what the expectations are.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes

 Ideally, the proposals will have cross-party support, so that the targets are honoured, and there can be certainty for the sectors that
 the targets affect.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 This should only be under exceptional circumstances, such as after a natural disaster, where leaving the budget the same would
 cause considerable harm to a significant portion of society which could not be mitigated in any other way.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

There should be significant consideration made to the impact on society, particularly those in lower socioeconomic circumstances. It
is important that none of the proposed changes have a negative impact on any portion of society in particular. Te Tiriti o Waitangi

should also be a consideration.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
It is important that the Government sets out plans, and that these plans are visible and accessible to everyone. There should be
timeframes, to ensure that Government is held accontable.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The Government needs to ensure that representatives from all walks of life are able to be heard on setting plans to meet budgets.
While this means industry and sectors, it is also important that there is targeted of young people (in particular, given that they will be
most affected by these changes in the future), Maori and Pacific Islanders, people in lower socioeconomic areas, and immigrants and

refugees. It is also important to get some cross-party support, so that the targets remain in place if there is a change in Government
in the near future.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
The Commission should have relevant experts available to advise the Government on the best approach to the ETS.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
The Climate Commission should also include representation from rangatahi- these are the leaders of the future, and need to be

involved in decisions and advice to the Government.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
Adaptation is going to be necessary, no matter how quickly we take action on climate issues. However, it is very important that the

main focus of the Act is on mitigation, and reducing carbon emissions as much and as quickly as possible.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
