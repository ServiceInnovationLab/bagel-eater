Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill












Reference no: 10762


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 The Government should work with the opposition to legislate a consensus position now.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 New Zealand should plan to meet its emission targets solely from domestic sources. By this means the process can be monitored

 and controlled more effectively and perhaps at lower cost.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Only if the understanding of the science of climate change undergoes a shift whereas the need for action to reduce emission is
 shown to be less urgent than is now the case.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 But only under the circumstances as outlined in the comments on question 4



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes

 But only under the circumstances as outlined in the comments on question 4



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
But only under the circumstances as outlined in the comments on question 4




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes
There should be a cost associated with all emissions regardless of the impact on particular sectors of the economy. In other words,

all emissions should be treated equally.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
All emissions should be included in the emissions trading scheme and the number of permits reduced over a set period of time.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The scheme needs to be agnostic towards all industries or it will become hostage to the lobbying of interest groups.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
The climate change commission decisions should be binding and independent of government interference. The commissioners

should be appointed by the government and have fixed terms of 3-5 years.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes

The CCC should be responsible for ensuring that targets are met and have the power to ensure they are.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Please note that although I am not currently resident in NZ I am a New Zealander and am making this submission for that reason. I
think NZ and every other country in the world should plan to reduce their emissions without constantly benchmarking that against

what everyone else is doing. Although NZ is only a tiny part of the problem of climate change NZ has an opportunity and a
responsibility as a relatively wealthy country to set an example for the rest of the world.
