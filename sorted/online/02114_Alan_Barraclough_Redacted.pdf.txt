Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Alan Barraclough






Reference no: 2114


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 While doing this, the emmissions budget should be changed, if it kills our industry and forces an industry into a country that is not

 reducing emmissions and would thereby have a worse global effect.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 If industries such as steel move to countries not under a zero emmissions target or not achieving or cheating on their targets then it

 is better for the climate that they remain here.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

We need to ensure we do not create a net negative by pushing industries where we have some emmissions to countries that have
complete disregard for emissions.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

Individuals need to be credited with the good they do for the environment, when they plant trees or leave land fallow. It needs some
recognition from councils in the rates. Land left as forest is valuable to society. Individuals need to be able to apply for credits.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
The Climate Commission needs to draft legislation relating to penalising companies and individuals, either lying about emmissions,

misreporting emmissions, or creating unmeasured emmissions.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
Agriculture will not have much time to adapt. We will need our Govt and Research institutions to actively research getting ahead of

climate change in terms of moving species and agriculture south.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
A just transition means that a monetary system for allocating emmissions to the rich based on their ability to pay is unjust. Just as rich

cant litter more than a poor person, nor should they be able to emit more as an individual. Therefore rationing systems rather than
auction systems should be put in place. Consideration should be given to the fact that it is the rich who have put the existing CO2 up

there in the atmosphere. It is clearly unjust that the poor equally pay to remove the CO2, and that the rich do not pay for the damage
ALREADY caused. We need to use our trading relationships to penalise or stop trade with countries which are not part of the Paris

agreement or are making no progress on reducing emmissions.
