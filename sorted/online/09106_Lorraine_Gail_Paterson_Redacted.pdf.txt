Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

As above, Lorraine Gail Paterson








Reference no: 9106

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 The Climate Change Commision needs to be in conversation with any group,individual,government that will listen to its reasoned
 advice on encouraging us all to be conscious of our daily carbon footprint.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 So important to give the viable alternatives to coal,gas and oil. Yes to greenhouse gases being 'old' technology A.S.A.P. The quicker

 the government leads the sooner businesses will plan for using alternative energies.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 We can only be responsible(tapatahi) for ourselves. Lead Aotearoa! Be inspiring. Like you were with anti-nuclear stance.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 The date 2050 is already out there in conversation. Even though I have said yes, change the date. I say this because I want to see
 positive change.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Certainly. This sounds promising.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes




 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes
Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The government needs to be reasonable when in discussion with fossil fuel companies. We need plans to upgrade cars that run on
petrol/diesel to be converted to use electricity. Government and Industry need to talk together about this.




Clause

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Yes

(NZ ETS)?

Position
Yes

exposure to climate change risks?
