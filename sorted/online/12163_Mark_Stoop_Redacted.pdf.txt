Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Mark Stoop






Reference no: 12163


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 Ignoring methane is a cop out, because it makes up so much of our emissions profile. To leave it out of the bill, just as agriculture was

 left out of the ETS, would be to turn a blind eye to the pollution which the industry can cause. Bringing farmers to account will achieve
 more than just dealing with our GHG emissions; it will also help to protect our environment on the more immediate scale of a
 comprehensive approach is taken. The farming sector is in dire need of reform, and while much of that goes beyond the scope of

 this bill, this is a good place to start.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes
 Ideally the fewer overseas credits we need, the better, but I appreciate that meeting our obligations may be difficult to do in the short

 term. It's a necessary evil.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 Yes, but it depends what you mean by "circumstances change". This is a very broad statement which leaves the door open to abuse
 and undermining of the bill.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

I could talk for hours about this, but submissions close today so I'll have to ignore it.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
Yes, but they could go a lot farther.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes

Notes
Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
I try to stay away from a cynical view of things, but it does seem unavoidable. Thus, considering the scope of the problem, the current

literature and the size and geopolitical power of New Zealand, I believe more emphasis should be put on adaption to climate change
than mitigation and prevention of it. Sustainability should be our focus; things are going to get very difficult over the next 100 years,
and there is only so much we can do to slow this. We are a small nation, and callous as it may seem, we need to be pragmatic. Hope

for the best (do work to improve our environmental policy and set an example for the rest of the world), prepare for the worst (realise
that it's already too late, and things are just going to get worse).
