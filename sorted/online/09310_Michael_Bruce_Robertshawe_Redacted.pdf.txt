Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Self, Mr (Michael Bruce Robertshawe)









Reference no: 9310

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes

 New Zealand is a very small country and has a minuscule global effect on any worldwide carbon emissions. When the large polluters
 of the planet, i.e. USA & China are prepared to do something meaningful then we join in, until then we are wasting our time and
 money pursuing this.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 No target at all until (1) has been achieved



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Notes
 By not setting any.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Change the target to allow New Zealand to compete on a level playing field. I feel the Zero Carbon Bill is a total waste of our
 resources, time and money. There are far more pressing things to address in this country that will result in a better environment to

 live, i.e youth crime, drug usage, educational standards, health, the list is long, but we make it hard when we go off on flights of
 fantasy, such as pursuing this bill.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes

 Scrap the bill and its targets.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes

 see (5)



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 See (5)
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Do not set targets or budgets.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
No

Notes
This sounds as if we are attempting to change the laws of physics. If there is a marked reduction in CO2 as a result of any efforts

made, vegetation will suffer, which in turn will cause any oxygen consuming life to suffer. Remove CO2 from the atmosphere and we
all die. 3rd form biology teaches this.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The Govt. needs to find a way to work with volcanoes!! these spew more carbon into the atmosphere than ever we can hope to

remove. The amount of carbon in the world is a constant, we can neither create nor destroy it. Encapsulating it in vegetation is the
best thing the world can do.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No
Notes

This whole Commission 'industry' is a huge waste of time and money, and as a taxpayer, it is my money and I object to it being wasted
on such things.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes
See (11,) get rid of the Commission.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes
The expertise needed is Divine and therefore not available. Dismantle the CCC




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No
Notes

The Bill should be scrapped. Concentrate our resources on issues that will benefit our population and not try to hoodwink them into
a wild goose chase.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
The only constant in the world is change. (Some clever person coined this phrase, but it is very true). For thousands, nay, millions of
years the climate on this planet has changed, Ice ages come and go. Warm periods come and go. The oil deposits in the Middle East

are a result of decaying vegetation that grew there millions of years ago, the place is a desert now, why? it is due to naturally
occurring changes our solar system produces, it is due to the laws of physics and we cannot change these, we can adapt tho'.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
No

Notes
This is another Job creation scheme! it will produce meaningless data and not alter anything except drain the small resources of the

Govts coffers.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
If one swings a bucket of water around in a circle the arc it describes is constant, due to the fact we have friction between our feet

and the ground, if this attempted whilst standing in a small boat the result is very different, as we are now subject to the centrifugal
force of the bucket of water, but with no constant axis. This is in effect what the Sun is doing, except it has 9 planets spinning around

and many are huge compared to the Earth. The sun therefore, having no means of axis fixation, will move in its own orbit. This will vary
according to the alignment of the planets. The Sun will move in relation to the Earth, therefore producing warm periods and cool
periods. This occurs over many thousands of years, history tells us of ice ages. Sir Issac Newton figured this out with his 3rd Law of

Motion. This whole Zero Carbon Emission thing is whistling into the wind. The Govt should direct its energies and finances into things
it can change and benefit the population of New Zealand and not buy into the hysteria of the moment.
