Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Beverley Trowbridge








Reference no: 2116

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes
 Methane emissions from farm livestock should be stabilised, ie, no net increase. Methane from livestock is a flow emission ie. a
 natural part of earth’s constant cycling of elements. So these specific emissions need to be no net gain. This can be achieved by

 farming practices- it is not feasible, or necessary to reduce these to zero. Methane being unlocked from more permanent stores of
 this compound eg permafrost, underwater, volcanic etc. should be treated differently.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Targets should only be allowed to be revised downwards, not upwards, ie stricter targets, not more lenient.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Second budget should only be able to be revised downwards, ie improved & strengthened, not slackened.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
But should also have the powers to decide policy.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes
Also researches internationally and sets parameters for monitoring soil carbon and soil carbon drawdown with a view to including this

into any ETS scheme so that by changing farming practrice farmers can offset their on-farm emissions to achieve net-zero by means
fo soil carbon increases. Soil carbon in pastoral sector has potential to contribute significantly to NZ’s ability to meet its GHG
emissions targets, and to change farming sector from bad guys to heros.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
We do not want a load of policy wonks & theoreticians- also do not want just a load of techno-fixers. People with practical knowledge

& skills- also some people with practical ecological knowledge would be ideal.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
Just to reiterate the importance of Regenerative Farming to our climate adaptation plans. this whole area is currently missing from

government & climate change commission’s thinking. In Tai Tokerau we are setting up a climate change trust and regenerative
farming is one of our key approaches for tackling climate change for the region. We have people available to talk to the CC

Commission about the value of taking a regenerative farming approach for NZ, as well as farms to see this in action.
