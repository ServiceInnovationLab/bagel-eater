Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Ivor Watson








Reference no: 9529

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 Somebody has to pay for whatever efforts the Government does to reduce carbon emissions. Ultimately that cost will fall on the

 citizens of New Zealand. Zero carbon emissions would put a huge burden on to New Zealand citizens that is senseless and
 unjustified.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Notes
 The Emissions Trading Scheme is a swindle that has created a large consulting industry for no worthwhile purpose other than to

 advise enterprises how to manipulate the scheme to their advantage and a bureaucracy to manage a very complex scheme.
 Government should abandon the Emissions Trading Scheme and replace it with a direct and transparent tax on the carbon content of
 fossil fuels as they are extracted or at port of entry into New Zealand. The tax would raise the price of fuel to New Zealand consumers

 but market forces would determine what citizens are prepared to pay to support Government carbon limiting policies.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Major carbon emitting countries do little to curb their carbon emissions.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 We are not the 5 year planned Soviet Union. We are a liberal market economy.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes
 We are a democracy not a communist state. The current government cannot fix what future governments can do or not do.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 We are a democracy not a communist state. The current government cannot fix what future governments can do or not do.



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
Government action should be influenced by events and information available at the time of decision making and not bound by past

views.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes
All plans are obsolete from the time they are published.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
It would be great to get some feedback as to what the Emissions Trading Scheme has or has not achieved.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
Advise Government to abandon it.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Provided the Commision takes note from experts whose views have a sound and measured basis and not all on airy fairy models.

Four variables in a model is sufficient to draw whatever you want.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
Realistic projections should be used to frame Government policies to safeguard the interests of New Zealand citizens.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
Insurance industry.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Any Government scheme should not include agriculture. The question is what damage are humans doing to the environment by
burning fossil fuels that have have been in the ground for eons. It has nothing to do with agriculture that humans have practiced for
the 10,000 years.
