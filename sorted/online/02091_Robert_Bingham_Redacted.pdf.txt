Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Robert Bingham








Reference no: 2091

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes
 It needs an independent body to avoid political pressure from industry.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 As the century progresses the destruction of our way of life will become apparent and there will be a great sense of urgency to

 achieve results. The sooner we get started the easier it will be.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Notes
 To stabilize the climate we will have to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and trees are probably the cheapest and easiest. It will
 probably not be enough but its a start.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Climate change wil almost certainly be much worse than we think at the moment.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 There is a lot to be done and changing from fossil fuels to renewables is not expensive if equipment is replaced with clean versions
 as the existing equipment wears out.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes
 Politicians are easily swayed by industry.




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No
 Notes
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

We need to stick to a long term plan and not change like the USA and Australia.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

many sectors of industry such as farmers and transport need help to transition to clean energy as they are currently very poorly
informed of the harsh facts.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
As I have already mentioned, politicians are easily swayed by industry and short term political gain.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes
If we have set a target we need professional and scientific advise on the solutions not rhetoric.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Scientific advise. Much closer in time with the latest research than the IPCC.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes

Probably not but we have to do what we can.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

We will shortly experience the start of even more extreme weather events and in a few decades will have sea level pulses where we
will lose Auckland and Wellington airports as well as a lot of other infrastructure which will cripple the economy.

Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
The combination of rapid sea level rise, warming and acidification of the oceans and changing weather patterns all coming together

will adversely alter our way of life and we need to be prepared to protect our people.
