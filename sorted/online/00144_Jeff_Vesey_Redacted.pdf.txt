 Notes
Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
This gives the chance for the electorate to say no at an election




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
industry and exporters who will be impacted adversely . The possible flow on effect to the public in lesser living standards ,less

money and less jobs. Budgets need to set out the best and worst consequences - no different to a surgeon saying what may
happen in an operation.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
There needs to be some robust discussion if the government deviates from advice - however the CCC needs to take into account

the well being os all New Zealanders in the present.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Yes

Notes
it needs also expertise to look after the general public that the proposed budgets do not affect jobs and or living standards including
the about of industry to be profitable.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes

Mechanisms need to be in place to ensure any climate change has a less impact on the public - eg - building in coastal areas



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
NZ largely depends on agriculture and is a world leader in this industry - the current proposal puts too much emphasis on reducing all

gases by 2050 without too much thought into what will happen to the agriculture industry and the flow on aeffects to all New
Zealanders as to standard of living ,wages ,jobs and general well being. A best case would be to target Co2 and working towards

clean energy and clean transport that is electrical vehicles.
