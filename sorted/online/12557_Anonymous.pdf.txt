Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill








Reference no: 12557


Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 It is worth noting that animal agriculture plays a significant role in Methane production. Emphasising a shift away from farmed animals

 to plant based proteins (high quality lentil/pea crops) could play a role in reducing the GROSS emissions from farming overall. Also,
 there is much research to suggest that non-organic farming (even for plant crops) degrades soil when using chemical
 fertilisers:https://grist.org/article/2010-02-23-new-research-synthetic-nitrogen-destroys-soil-carbon-undermines/ Soil degradation

 then leads to Carbon loss to the atmosphere (increasing effects from draughts, less soil humus etc) and increases gross carbon
 emission. Without testing the soil OR having effective systems for carbon sequestration, farmers might be only speculating to say

 that they are increasing soil carbon - especially in chemically fertilised farms. Some possible solutions to reduce GROSS carbon: tax
 breaks for farmers a) not using chemical fertilisers, b) shifting from animal farming to plant crops like industrial hemp, lentils which
 feed the public the same and remove carbon from the atmosphere For NET carbon: systems like MyNoke compost application to

 farms can bring carbon back to the farm and reduce overall soil/carbon loss. Tax breaks could be given for farmers apply carbon with
 their field applications in both animal and plant farms where diesel/fossil fuel machinery emits carbon. Bear in mind that emissions
 should be calculated to prove carbon application is reducing their overall carbon footprint. ___ Aside from farms: other large scale

 industry needs to play its part also. Full large taxes on coal burners for Fonterra/hospitals may create incentive to choose
 electric/biodiesel burners. Putting the burden all on the individual (farmer or public) as the USA does will not bring down emissions

 enough - Large cooperations MUST be a part of the solution and reduce the GROSS emissions.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
 Notes
 Ensure that those involved in high emission sectors (farms/production/transport) have options to transition to which allow them

 retain their foothold in the industry. E.g farmers should be aware that non-animal farms can produce MORE output with LESS
 emissions. For forestry: that hemp can absorb carbon 4 TIMES AS FAST as traditional pine trees (great right!)

 industries may loss their global edge and reduce NZ's capacity to export great crops/products.
Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
