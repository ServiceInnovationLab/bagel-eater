Reference no: 12924


Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 A target is good (Cf Predator Free NZ target), but whether 0 Mt CO2e or 25 Mt CO2e should be set I'm not sure. The target should be
 ambitious, clear, and science-based.. The target should comply with the Paris Agreement of well below 2 degrees Celsius and striving
 for not more than a 1.5 increase in global temperature. Already at 1.2 degrees the weather extremes, etc being experienced now by

 multiple communities and natural systems around the world are too hard to bear... Cross-party consensus should be used to set
 directions/ parameters and the overall target so as to promote political accountability and clarity. The Climate Commission should
 advise on specific targets, adjustments if required - as part of its independent and expert role in advising, monitoring and - widely and

 publicly reporting. There needs to be constant education of the public to keep all sorts of environmental issues at the forefront of
 thinking and living in NZ/ Aotearoa.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases
 Notes

 While long-lived gases are the big bogeys for climate change, reducing short-lived gases to as low as possible should also be a goal.
 'Stabilising' levels should be a prelude to going as low as we can. The special place of agriculture in NZ - and methane in particular - is
 recognised, but changes in agriculture would/ should also include changes in land use and kinds and numbers of animals farmed,

 perhaps even on a regional/ soil type basis. In particular, there needs to be tighter controls on and monitoring of dairying in many
 parts of NZ. NOTE; Increasing numbers of farmers are becoming more environmentally aware and shifting to 'organic'/ other low-

 environmental-impact/ highly sustainable systems. Some of the economic modelling documents produced to provide guidance for
 the zero carbon debate and analysis do not seem to mention this shift and the overall impact it will / could have !!!



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 To include international emissions/ C units would weaken/ dilute/ confuse NZ's policies and efforts. Inclusion of overseas C credits in
 the past was a fiasco... We need to do what is right here at home. If purchasing of international credits could help some smaller

 countries/ more vulnerable areas achieve their zero C goals, NZ could help them in other ways by having an environmentally and
 economically sustainable aid/ development policy.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 BUT - reduced targets only in very special circumstances such as another huge earthquake....and conversely more ambitious targets

 - e.g. negative C - if there is a major technological/ practical breakthrough... Targets per se should not allow agriculture and transport
 etc, to drag the chain on moving to a Carbon Zero future. Advising and monitoring by the Climate Change Commission must include
 ALL major sectors and their major stakeholders.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes
Clause
6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

Position
No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

Notes
In general, budgets should be honoured and that is why cross-party consensus is important. The special circumstances clause could

allow for some flexibility, if really needed.



Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

I think questions around second and third budgets is ridiculous. Has it not already been covered above?? Perhaps we should be
asking more about the length of the Parliamentary Term?



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
Given the 3 year Parliamentary term, perhaps 100 days / 6 months max should be the limit .



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Things to consider • scientific knowledge about climate change • technology relevant to climate change • economic circumstances

and, in particular, the likely impact of the decision on the economy and the competitiveness of particular sectors of the economy •
fiscal circumstances and, in particular, the likely impact of the decision on taxation, public spending and public borrowing • social

circumstances and, in particular, the likely impact of the decision on fuel poverty • energy policy and, in particular, the likely impact of
the decision on energy supplies and the carbon and energy intensity of the economy • the government’s obligations under the
Treaty of Waitangi • the three government objectives for climate change policy: sustainable economy, global and local leadership and

creating a just and inclusive society All major sectors and businesses and representatives of a wide range of stakeholder groups
should be included. Public submissions should be kept open and responsive.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
However: Given the important role of the primary sector in the C story, I would hope that representation of agriculture, forestry and
horticulture practitioners/ producer organisations, scientists/ innovators and businesses would be increased. Also, what about public

health issues and/ or outcomes? Perhaps the Commission would bring in/ consult with different experts according to what was being
discussed - without losing sight of the overall goals and framework of the Act, and keeping within its budgets and targets.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

At least in an overall/ overseeing position.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Advisory role is probably the most important for the Commissioners per se. Perhaps separate agents within the MfE/ agencies such
as Territorial Authorities should be involved in and tasked with practical mitigation in areas related to adapting to climate change.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
If harvested wood products were better accounted for/ retained within NZ for C credit/ ETS purposes, we could probably achieve

Zero C faster and move to more sustainable forestry systems and reduce our almost total dependence on plantation forestry (less
logs exported more wood for domestic purposes, etc). New models in the forestry sector are certainly needed. The One Billion Trees

plan is really helpful only if it avoids the pitfalls of past large forestry programmes and includes a better mix of species for avoidance of
recent disasters such as in Tolaga Bay... Please keep the environment and environmental impacts right, left and centre in the Zero
Carbon Bill.. It is encouraging to see some of NZ's biggest companies joining the Zero Carbon movement. They would not do that if it

did not make economic sense, i.e. be good for their profitability and sustainability....
