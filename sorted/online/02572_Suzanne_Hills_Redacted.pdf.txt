Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Suzanne Hills








Reference no: 2572

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 A goal is too easily missed. We must have a legislated target.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes
 We should use every possible means to get there, and this will support tree planting in other countries.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 NO WAY. We are in this mess because the problem has been kicked into the future by successive governments.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Minimum 15 years, no less.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes
 But only for very sound reasons and there must still be a clear plan for achieving zero carbon 2050.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
 Notes
 No, it sounds too much like another way to push the problem into the future. There will nearly always be exceptional circumstances -

 we must have commitment to these budgets no matter what the social, economical conditions - it is too important.



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes

Of course it must. Surely everything unravels without plans and time frames.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Apart from the obvious agricultural, forestry, energy and transport sectors, why is it always assumed that more wealth means a better
standard of living. Personally I would rather be worse off economically but have a zero carbon economy. Because this economy will

mean a better, healthier world and therefore standard of living.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

But this is so critical to a healthy future, there must be mechanisms to hold successive governments to account. An advisory role
only is not robust enough for right wing pro-business governments as- our environment has been degraded by such governments.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Get the very best people - they are critical.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

PLEASE make this bill happen asap. I am deeply concerned about climate change. We must act now before our beautiful world
unravels.
