Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Reference no: 2072

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes
 I think the Climate Change Commission should have more than purer advisory. It's recommendations should become policy with the

 Caveat that the recommendation would need to be rejected by 75% of MPs for the recommendation not to proceed. This assumes
 that CCC (climate change commission) is appropriately balanced in membership and appropriately resourced with access to the best
 science & knowledge. The TOR would clearly be written along the lines of achieving the objectives that the government as agreed to

 both nationally & internationally and this to be achieved at least to economy in the broadest sense. The government with a 75% veto
 would be able to set context where recommendations could be deferred because of national calamity or similar.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases
 Notes

 As a high performing low intensity pastoral farmer there are some real challenges in trying to manage Methane in particular. We will
 get gains on nitro s Oxide as we try to manage nitrogen losses. We need an increased science to help find solution(s) to CH4
 challenge. I believe that GMO's should be considered as part of solution and this something that CCC could evaluate. We as a nation

 should go hard on those gases where we have proven solutions and tackle the most challenging ones later. We do need to stabilise
 the short term gases because if they are allowed to increase this undermines the gains made in other areas.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes

 The last option makes more sense as potentially it allows for the most effective use of the globes resources (in theory). My
 observation with any form of tradeable rights is that rather achieving the desired outcomes of reductions and efficient use of
 resources, they are often captured by those with the most capital at the expense of those less resourced potentially increasing the

 disparity in wealth between individuals and between nations. Rather than ICU's per se maybe the model should be that NZ'ers and
 NZ farmers could say provide money to say a UN fund that could plant trees and forests elsewhere thereby both creating

 employment and potentially wealth in those areas. i.e. a variation on ICU's model.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes

 Yes but requiring a higher hurdle rate in government than just 50% to take the decision away from a purer party vote.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

Position
Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

Notes
Need to be able to adapt to change circumstance. I would much prefer to see the budgets fixed with a 75% hurdle for changes

required. There can always be exceptional circumstances - famine - natural disaster - war.



Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
see above




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Need to be able to collect real information on the real impacts of the legislation on the people as potentially the poorest people in the

community could be most disadvantaged if cost of fuel and food increase excessively. Question: how should an inflation resulting
from the changes be handled by the Reserve Bank?



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No
Notes

I agree with the functions but I do wonder if some decision making powers are not appropriate to keep the decisions from being too
political but as said early a check always needs to be in place. I wonder how much further ahead had the government chief science

advisor had some decision making powers.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Agree with those attributes but there needs to be some linkage between CCC and various sectors Energy Local government,

Agriculture horticulture etc.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
It should identify work & science streams that need happen for adaption.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Really appreciate the pro active way that engagement on this issue is being handled - congratulations
