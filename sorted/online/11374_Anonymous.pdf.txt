Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill








Reference no: 11374


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes

 There should be positive encouragement to reduce emissions but no firm targets.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Notes
 Net Zero Long or Short lived is technically impossible. So the target should not be Net Zero.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 It should be revised from day one.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes
 Yes. Circumstances change and we need to be able to adapt.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 It should not require exceptional circumstances.



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes



 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

 Position
 No
 Notes
Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

There should be no economic hardship as a result of changes.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Notes
NZ ETS should be scrapped.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes
We need more resilience anyway.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
The science that has gone into this is shonky at best. 1) The range of climate sensitivity is between 1-4 degrees. At 1 degree it

justifies no action - yet we are casting this in stone with these 2050 targets. 2) Pasture dairy farms are net CO2 sinks yet they are
punished because they are methane emitters. Methane only 1.25x worse than CO2 over a long time period. Farming needs to be

excluded. 3) Unless someone magically creates electric aircraft and electric ships, and electric steel manufacture there is no way that
we can achieve Net Zero C02. You simply can't fix enough CO2 to offset this!
