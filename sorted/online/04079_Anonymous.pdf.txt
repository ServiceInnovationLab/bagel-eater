Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill







Reference no: 4079

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived

 gases
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 I feel it is important for NZ not to rely on other countries to achieve its emission reductions. This is important from a number of

 reasons, including to reinforce our "clean green" image, to show leadership in the global community, and to decrease our reliance on
 other countries.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Yes, including an upside change if circumstances are beneficial.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes
 I am concerned about NZ's competitiveness and that the transition may be affected by circumstances beyond NZ's control. Perhaps

 any review should include a recommendation (or a range) from the Climate Change Commission, and any change should be justified
 by the Govt.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Yes, but the threshold should be high. Also, upside adjustments should be supported.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes, but where the final outcome of an affected industry in a low carbon economy is obsolescence/irrelevance, then this should not
impact on the transition. As an example we should not resist the transition the EVs to prevent economic losses to owners of petrol

stations - owners of potentially stranded assets need to adapt or fail.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Support advisory with mechanisms to hold the government to account.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

I would like to see greater incentives for EVs. NZ has great existing infrastructure for EVs but very weak incentives - far lower than
many other countries despite our clear advantages in this area. We also risk being a dumping ground for stranded ICE vehicles. There

is significant pent up demand internationally for quality EVs and only limited production capacity (look at the Tesla Model 3 waiting list
& the Hyundai Kona EV is sold out in many markets). We may also see ICE vehicles being more aggressively marketed in NZ as they
lose market share to EVs internationally - this is an inevitable market response in countries without incentives or fuel efficiency

requirements. My household will be replacing one of our vehicles at the end of the year and I am actively shopping for a suitable EV,
however my options are either too expensive or unsuitable. I also consider the environmental benefits of PHEVs to be overstated, as

well as economics not stacking up considering the additional upfront cost and maintenance. The feebate system proposed by the
Productivity Commission would make the higher upfront cost of a suitable EV more palatable.
