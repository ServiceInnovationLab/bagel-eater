Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

None (David Murray Robinson)




Reference no: 2065

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later

 Notes
 The speed of progress towards the target should be determined by the international carbon price (or proxies thereof) as the least

 cost path for NZ. NZ is very small and will be a carbon price taker.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 None of the above. The speed of progress towards the target should be determined by the international carbon price (or proxies
 thereof) as the least cost path for NZ



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes

 If the government manages the release of NZ ETS units to match the international carbon price then the need to purchase
 international credits will be limited.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 The speed of progress towards the target should be determined by the international carbon price (or proxies thereof) as the least

 cost path for NZ.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes

 The speed of progress towards the target should be determined by the international carbon price (or proxies thereof) as the least
 cost path for NZ.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 The speed of progress towards the target should be determined by the international carbon price (or proxies thereof) as the least

 cost path for NZ.
Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
No
Notes

The speed of progress towards the target should be determined by the international carbon price (or proxies thereof) as the least
cost path for NZ.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

(NZ ETS)?

Notes
