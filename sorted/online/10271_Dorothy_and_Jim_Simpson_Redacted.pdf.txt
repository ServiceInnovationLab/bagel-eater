Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Dorothy Simpson, J and D Simpson family Trust (Dorothy and Jim Simpson)








Reference no: 10271

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Carbon Dioxide - Reducing net carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 At present only forestry is considered to be a carbon sink, whereas fast growing plants are not recognised. Such as grass and flax

 (riparian plantings).



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 More research on cows etc producing methane is underway and the results of this could have considerable bearing on what needs
 to be done.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Notes

 Insufficient information to make a decision. At present only forestry is considered to be a carbon sink, whereas fast growing plants are
 not recognised. Such as grass and flax (riparian plantings).



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 We don't know what climate change is going to do.



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
It needs to be able to be reviewed regularly as circumstances change. But a plan is needed.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Work with forestry - because forestry needs to respect waterways as do farmers. Forestry companies need to plant the riparian strip

to prevent (a) waste going into waterways after harvesting, (b) to keep a continuous barrier between pine exudate and waterways to
ensure streamlife remains healthy. (c) to prevent soil erosion. (d) this would also ensure some carbon sinking continues during

harvesting.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
Advisory with mechanisms built in to hold a government to account.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

Amazing if you can get people with all that expertise! People with a practical point of view are important. Not all theoretical, academic
and narrow point of views.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Notes
maybe.... this seems to be happening at present. There needs to be good communication between all groups and the population.




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
At present only forestry is considered to be a carbon sink, whereas fast growing plants are not recognised. Such as grass, cabbage

trees, manuka and flax (riparian plantings). Riparian planting should be undertaken for all new developments to protect waterways
and to act as a carbon sink in town and country. When making decisions about different communities and regions there should be
opportunities for those with local knowledge to have input as in the past decisions have been made by groups of people in

Wellington that do not take into account local conditions and things that could easily be solved by good communication with all
parties. For example: Spending huge amounts of money on the Brynderwyn Hills when the problem had been solved by reducing the

speed limit to 80 kph. (Information from local Fire Parties who attend accidents in that area). And now they are talking about building a
whole new motorway away from the Brynderwyns. A waste of taxpayers money. Very poor planning. Let's not make the same mistake

twice.
