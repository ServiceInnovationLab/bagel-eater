Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 gases

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 The Bill needs to be transparent including annual reporting which is also accessible to our pacific neighbours.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
We must take responsibility for our global emissions and the climate impacts that we have contributed to. It’s very important that all

New Zealanders have their say on how we make the shift to a zero carbon future here in New Zealand but we must also help the
world’s most vulnerable communities across the Pacific adjust to the impacts on climate change.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
We must ensure that the Zero Carbon Bill is transparent. This means the bill must include a requirement to produce annual reports

about New Zealand’s international climate change contributions in order to ensure that the Pacific countries get the support they
need and can plan to adapt to their changing environment.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

.Transparency in the Bill will promote public engagement and political accountability. New Zealanders will be able to understand the
international contributions we are making and as a nation, we will be able to stand tall that we are supporting our Pacific neighbours

adapt to their climate change reality.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
It is time for New Zealand to lead again. We have a history of global leadership: we were the first country to give women the vote and

the first to become nuclear free. It is time to take another giant step towards climate justice globally. New Zealand has demonstrated
global leadership with our commitment to stopping oil and gas exploration – now let us continue that moral leadership and include

transparency in what and how we support climate change efforts abroad.
