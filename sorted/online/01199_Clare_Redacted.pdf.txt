 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 Based on my reading (see excerpts below) I support Option 3, ie. reduce all GG emissions to net zero by 2050. This is primarily
 because of methane's warming potential (sea level rise is a significant issue for NZ) & also for NZ to have time to adapt & develop the

 means to make the necessary changes for the longer term. Methane will become a more significant issue internationally as carbon
 dioxide levels are reduced. NZ has such a high proportion of methane emissions cf. our other sources of greenhouse gasses and so
 our profile differs from most other countries and we wont be able to avoid tackling this long term anyway. And methane already

 currently contributes more than 20% of the warming CO2 contributes. " Because methane is both a powerful greenhouse gas and
 short-lived compared to carbon dioxide, achieving significant reductions would have a rapid and significant effect on atmospheric

 warming potential." United States Environmental Protection Agency website "Methane in the atmosphere is short-lived, in contrast
 with nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide. If the flow of methane into the atmosphere stopped rising, and there were no other
 greenhouse gas emissions, the temperature of the atmosphere would stabilise in a few decades. Nevertheless, methane emissions

 are damaging. For instance, while methane molecules disappear relatively rapidly from the atmosphere, they do leave some damage
 behind. Most of the heat that they trap is absorbed into the ocean, contributing to sea level rise." Climate change and
 agriculture:Understanding the biological greenhouse gases, PCE report October 2016 "To make large changes in CH4 in the long

 term, New Zealand would need to act now (not only through research and development but also development of policies and early
 adoption of new land uses, practices and technologies), in order to be ready to act fast later. Early action on CH4 and clear signals of

 a future transition to low-CH4 would avoid New Zealand being locked into a high-CH4 pathway – and facing high levels of stranded
 assets if required to reduce CH4 rapidly in future. There are three reasons to act strongly to reduce CH4 now (in addition to actions
 on CO2 and N2O). First, a strong concern about short-term temperature rise, i.e. the path of temperature rise towards a given long-

 term level, and the short-term impacts of climate change. Second, an understanding that human (and natural) systems do not adapt
 quickly, meaning the welfare costs of rapid climate change could be much higher than those of the same temperature change over a
 longer period. Third, if New Zealand does not act strongly to reduce CH4 (and unless the international inventory rules are changed, or

 looser targets to allow for ongoing high-CH4 emissions in the short term are negotiated), New Zealand will face costs (both economic
 and political) based on current CH4 metrics which value CH4 reductions quite highly. The effect is significant: agricultural emissions,

 CH4 and N2O, using current metrics for CH4, made up 48% of New Zealand’s emissions in 2013 (Ministry for the Environment 2015)
 and CH4 alone makes up 30%. Recent modelling (Stroombergen 2015; Daigneault 2015) indicates that New Zealand will struggle to
 meet its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) of lowering total emissions by 30% relative to 2005 levels by 2030

 through domestic mitigation without significant mitigation of agricultural emissions or afforestation." Agricultural Emissions Mitigation

 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
Position
Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

Notes



Clause

7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes
