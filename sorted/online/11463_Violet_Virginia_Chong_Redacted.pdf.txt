Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Violet Virginia Chong






Reference no: 11463


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 We don't have time to wait until later.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 It is the most ambitious target but it means that if we fail to completely meet it we may end up at least surpassing either of the other
 two.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 We should aim to be selling emissions reductions to other countries, not buying them.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 But only under extreme circumstances, so that we don't lose sight of the main goal when it starts to hurt.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes
 Once we get started it's going to hurt many of us economically and we will probably all want to make a u-turn because it seems too

 hard. But governments should only be able to review the budget if circumstances are extreme. Otherwise progress might come to a
 halt



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 because extreme circumstances are going to increase in frequency.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Climate changes scientists need to be at the forefront as they are the ones who can advise how we are doing and how we can do

better. Also need to ensure that our tenancy, consumer and employment rights are not curtailed if businesses and Govt feel the
need to cut expenditure in order to absorb increased costs related to reducing emissions.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

Needs to be able to hold the government to account, and the emitters as well.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

How well we adapt to climate change will affect our ability and motivation to progress toward our 2050 target, and vice versa.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Agree with proposal to increase forestation. We want to be able to contribute to this as individuals and communities too, but how will
the trees we plant be counted towards the 1 billion? There is an issue with the cost of EVs. It is the wealthier households who can

afford EVs since there are few that are secondhand. Why not ban the import of petrol and diesel cars? We'd have to make exceptions
for vehicles which don't have an EV subsititute. All public transport should be electric. Wellington City Council replaced all of the trolley

buses with mostly diesel buses, so we need more support for providers of public transport to switch to electric rather than the other
kind. Also public transport has to be able to cope with a growing population of elderly, who don't have the physical ability to walk or

cycle long distances.
