Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 12165

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 But only in response to hard scientific consensus and recommendations from committees of experts. It should be easy to change in
 the direction of further reducing emissions (i.e. making the target sooner), but difficult to change in the opposite direction (i.e.

 making the target date later).



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes

 But again, only in response to hard scientific consensus and recommendations from committees of experts. It should be easy to
 change in the direction of further reducing emissions (i.e. making the target sooner/reducing emissions further), but difficult to

 change in the opposite direction (i.e. making the target date later/allowing for more emissions).



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 But again, only in response to hard scientific consensus and recommendations from committees of experts. It should be easy to
 change in the direction of further reducing emissions (i.e. making the target sooner/reducing emissions further), but difficult to

 change in the opposite direction (i.e. making the target date later/allowing for more emissions).
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Need to to work with an array scientific experts in the field to determine: what are appropriate and achievable budgets to set; novel
ways to meet budgets; most efficient and sustainable ways to meet budgets; other issues/considerations which may arise Should

also integrate this with advice from sustainable economic experts on efficient investment of government resources and technology
industries to gather ideas on how budgets might be met in the best and most sustainable ways




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Should be advisory, but should have specific mechanisms in place to hold the government to account and keep the public informed



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
But again, with strong mechanisms in place to hold the government to account and keep the public informed



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Climate change is one of the most serious threats facing our future generations of kiwis. Laws to ameliorate and adapt to the effects
of climate change should be expertly-informed, set concrete goals, and hold government of the day to account. Failing to do so is to

fail the future of our country and the individuals who will have to reside here.
