Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill






Reference no: 9283

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 I think that the Government should set a goal to reduce emissions at some point in the future when major emitters are taking
 effective steps to reduce their emissions profile. I don't accept that a new target is desirable or necessary. New Zealand is

 responsible for a tiny proportion of global emissions and, because of the make up of its emissions profile and industries, any attempt
 to significantly reduce emissions runs the risk of causing undue damage to the country's economy. I do not think that this risk is

 warranted to "set an example" to the rest of the world. Until the "big three" emitters demonstrate their commitment to reducing
 emissions by concrete actions anything other minor emitters do is simply irrelevant.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Notes
 See previous answer. New Zealand should not be hobbling its economic activity in this way.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 By reducing domestic emissions where this will not have an adverse effect on economic activity, for example, where new technology
 or technological improvements result in lower emissions in the process of improving operating efficiency or as a by-product of new
 processes. For example, new petrol-powered motor cars produce much less carbon dioxide per kilometre of use than cars produced

 even a few years ago, thus reducing New Zealand's net emissions anyway.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Most definitely. Climate change is a natural process that has always and will always occur. What this Bill is aimed at is the additional
 effect caused by human activity. I have seen no credible evidence that any of the predictions arising from any of the global warming or
 climate change models have actually come to pass. Thirty years ago climate scientists were warning that in thirty years time we would

 be experiencing a mini-ice age, now they are predicting the opposite. The Minister himself accepts that the economic modelling
 cannot be accurate over a 30-year time frame (page 29 of the Discussion Document) but seems oblivious of the fact that the same

 uncertainty must apply to any model where there is not a defined, proven and reproducible mathematical formula for predicting the
 effects of any particular action. The climate is an incredibly complex chaotic system that we do not understand at any level. It seems
 to be impossible to predict the weather, as opposed to climate, with any degree of accuracy over anything more than 24 hours. Nor

 can we predict the occurrence of effects of natural phenomena such as volcanic eruptions that will result in large quantities of carbon
 dioxide and other "greenhouse gases" being added to the atmosphere, together with the formation of gigantic ash clouds that will

 inevitably affect the weather patterns. Circumstances will inevitably change, other countries may or may not come good on their
 promises, unexpected factors or events may make it impossible for New Zealand to meet whatever targets are set and those targets
 must be flexible.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Yes, provided that all three can be altered according to circumstances, especially economic ones in New Zealand.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Notes
 The Government should be able to alter all three budgets as and when necessary.
Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

The Government should be able to alter all three budgets as and when necessary. In particular, if the economic situation in New
Zealand deteriorates, whether or not this is due to the emissions reduction measures or if the reduction measures are shown to be

having a disproportionate effect on vulnerable segments of NZ society.



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Both sides of the scientific debate and knowledge about climate change must be taken into account as must technology but
economic, fiscal and social factors must be paramount. If any proposed measures are likely to have an adverse effect on vulnerable
segments of the NZ population then these measures must be ruled out.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
The Zero Carbon Bill must require Governments to set out proposals within the first 12 months after an election.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The most important issues for the Government to consider are the social, economic and fiscal implications of the plans. The Minister
has accepted that additional benefits will be necessary to minimise the effects on certain sectors of the population. This is a critical

part of the planning and by no means the easiest. The poorest members of society are likely to be hard hit and targeting financial
help at them will be relatively easy. The difficult segments of society will be those who are on the cusp of any benefits or just above

the thresholds as these are always the ones who suffer disproportionately as increases in income are often outweighed by
reductions in benefit.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
I believe that it is imperative that the Climate Change Commission has no executive powers whatsoever, its role must be purely

advisory and another independent body must be charged with the monitoring. The Commission could SUGGEST what it believes to
be appropriate levels and compositions for emissions budgets but the Government must decide. The Commission must seek
independent scientific advice rather than being the source of such advice. Using this advice, the Commission could suggest the

extent to which New Zealand should take account of any international emissions changes in setting domestic targets.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Notes
I do not think that the Commission should have any role in policy setting in relation to the ETS. I believe that the ETS needs a
fundamental rethink and restructuring to ensure that it does not adversely affect any important sectors of the New Zealand economy.

All decisions must be taken by Government after full consultation with interested parties, both industry and the public.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

I do not think that a Commission of a manageable and sensible size can hope to encompass all of the necessary expertise within its
members and it will be more appropriate for the Commission members to be experienced in policy decision-making and

implementation in order that they will have a good appreciation of the challenges inherent in this. The first and most important
characteristic that members of the Commission must have is open-mindedness. The second is the ability to recognise when it is
necessary to seek expert advice and scientific input. After that, essential expertise must include the social impacts of economic

change and policy; awareness of the potential impacts on local government and the ability of local government to respond, with or
without help from central government; risk management.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes

A fundamental part of any government's responsibility must be to take account of the costs of adapting to changed circumstances,
whether this be, for example, natural disasters such as earthquakes, coastal erosion as a natural process or the inevitable effects of

having permitted housing to be built on a flood plain. It matters not what has caused these changes and it is futile to try and predict
what changes are likely as the majority will be truly unpredictable.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
As per the previous question, the Government must assist local communities to build resilience against any natural disaster not just

"climate change". Sea level rise may or may not occur, severe weather events may or may not become more frequent, earthquakes
may or may not happen, but planning should take place so that communities can be assured of support if they are affected by any
unexpected event.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Notes
I have no idea what this is supposed to mean. As climate change risks are just as un-quantifiable and unpredictable as natural

disasters I do not see how this can possibly add anything useful to the mix.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

The most important principle that medical doctors are taught is "Do no harm". I believe that this should be the over-riding principle for
the Bill in relation to the New Zealand economy. New Zealand's contribution to global emissions is miniscule and hamstringing the
country's economy in an attempt to make futile changes is, in my opinion, unforgivable. I do not wish my name or email address to be

published on the Ministry for the Environment’s website, in any release to the public under the Official Information Act or in any
summary of submissions that the Ministry may publish.
