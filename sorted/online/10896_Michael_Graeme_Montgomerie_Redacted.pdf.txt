Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Michael Graeme Montgomerie








Reference no: 10896

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes
 This is the obvious position for New Zealand to adopt. It is in keeping with our Paris Accord undertakings and prioritises work on the
 most important long lived gases. It gives us a little more time to deal with the difficult issue of enteric methane. The accounting

 principles for enteric methane are still somewhat debatable and the mitigation options are limited. It would be reckless for NZ to
 adopt a policy of net zero emissions of methane by 2050 given the importance of pastoral farming to our economy. No overseas

 jurisdictions seem likely to follow suit meaning there would be significant emissions leakage to off-shore sources.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 The international carbon units have obviously been a rort. It is hard too see this changing the future. It is better to be honest with our
 own efforts (even if they are on the modest side) than rely on offshore carbon credits of dubious quality.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No

 Notes
 Future Parliaments are free to do whatever they choose. Make the 2050 target 'hard'. If a future government wants to change that
 target let them do it by legislation.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 As for 4 above.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
No

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No
Notes

This is a separate issue. Adaptation will likely be required more at a regional and district level.
