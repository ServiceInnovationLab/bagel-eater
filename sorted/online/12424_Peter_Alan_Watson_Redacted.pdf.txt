Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Peter Alan Watson





Reference no: 12424

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 I believe we should set in law a 2050 target but work toward a 2040 target. This provides the flexibility if circumstances change.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 Yes, though the targets need to have some accountability. They need to be achievable yet increasingly aggressive. Things like major
 earthquakes should not be used as an excuse not to reach a target but an opportunity to rebuild buildings and businesses with
 renewable carbon zero mindset.




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes

 It depends. Are you looking to build a carbon zero nz with the option to ramp things up? Or are you looking for excuses?



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
 Though again, see question 6.



 Clause

 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
Just promoting and encouraging businesses that will help transition to a renewable economy e.g. can we manufacture solar panels in

NZ? Cen we at least encourage solar installation? Imagine a workforce in Taranaki based on solar installation instead of oil and gas
extraction. We need to replace the outgoing jobs with something new.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
The Climate Change Commission needs to have teeth to enforce these goals not just act in an advisory role or the whole thing is

pointless



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

Until a government can show that the ETS works then I think it should be scrapped for a carbon tax. Up until now the ETS has been
ineffective.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
If you want something to improve, first you need to measure it.




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Climate change is my main concern, though there are other aspects to think about. Air pollution is just one. I occasionally run to work

(8.5 km). I only a gag is when I run past a school at 8:30 in the morning. With the line of cars and a bus or 2 the fumes are horrible. I
know that I notice it more because I am running, the kids are still breathing in all those fumes. Think about that when you drop your
child off at school.
