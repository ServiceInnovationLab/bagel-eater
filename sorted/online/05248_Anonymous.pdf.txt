Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill








Reference no: 5248


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 I support all greenhouse gases being included in the law, consistent with international climate frameworks. The Intergovernmental
 Panel on Climate Change makes it clear that methane reduction is critical to success in tackling climate change. It is politically and
 scientifically untenable for New Zealand’s climate law to exclude any gases from our biggest emitting sector - the agricultural sector.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 I support the ‘firewall’ principle, that New Zealand’s targets must be achieved by actual cuts in our own emissions, and not through

 the purchase of overseas carbon credits or an over-reliance on forests as carbon sinks



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No
 Notes




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes



 Clause

 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

To meet the zero target in a linear decrease towards the target. Need to work with home owners and industry to convert to
renewable energy and make every new house or office/factory have solar panels

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
