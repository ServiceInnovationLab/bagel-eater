 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 The proposed Climate Change Commission may recommend that the NZ parliament change the 2050 target if and only if there are

 major changes in scientific understanding or international agreements concerning climate change. The legislation should require a
 75% majority in any parliamentary vote to effect the recommended change.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 The proposed Climate Change Commission may recommend that the third emissions budget be changed if and only if there are
 major changes in scientific understanding or international agreements concerning climate change. The legislation should require a

 75% majority in any parliamentary vote to effect the recommended change.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
 Notes
 Not under any circumstances.



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
The legislation should require the Government to set out it's plans to achieve emissions budgets within six months from the date

they are issued by the Climate Change Commission.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Local Government should be legally obliged to consider the Climate Change Commission's recommendations in their planning.
Strong coordination with business groups. Ensure that individuals who lose jobs or income as a result of these plans are offered

meaningful opportunities for alternative employment. LEAD BY EXAMPLE. Ambitious, forward looking goals - eg eliminate the sale or
import of fossil fuel powered cars by 2030.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

The Climate Change Commission should provide a progress report in the last quarter of every Parliamentary term before elections are
held.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Climate change will affect every New Zealander irrespective of race, creed or gender so it is not appropriate that Maori interests
should have a special, privileged voice on the Commission or be given special consideration. There should also be members who

have expertise in energy systems and ecosystems as these have been omitted from the list on page 45 of the discussion document.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
There should be a separate adaptation sub-committee within the Climate Commission based on the UK model.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Stop people building in areas that will be drowned by sea level rise.
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Scientists started warning us about the dangers of climate change over thirty years ago and yet we have done almost nothing to
address the problem in this country. We need to stop talking about it and start incentivizing radical change. Please get on with it.
