Reference no: 9751

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 Setting a firm target creates greater certainty and a more stable environment in which investment decisions can be made, early on.
 By encouraging the required investment into infrastructure at the outset there will be a stronger probability that 2050 targets will be

 met.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 Managing emissions reduction requires long-term behaviour change. Reducing all greenhouse gas emissions from across all sectors
 – including the agricultural sector - requires that technologies and new methodologies be introduced early on to combat the long-

 term effects of global warming resulting from greenhouse gas emissions. Clear policy signals and firm targets will stimulate
 investment into low emission agricultural techniques, ensuring that NZ is able to be more resilient in terms of managing its cross-
 sector emissions; managing and preserving its immediate natural environment; and building long-term export market resilience by

 maintaining a competitive edge in international markets.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 Relying on domestic carbon sinks and abatement technologies will greatly improve both New Zealand’s cyclical carbon sequestration
 capacity and support native biodiversity through substantially increased native forest coverage. This is preferable to transferring
 emission abatement obligations overseas through the purchase of potentially sub-standard credits. Internalising domestic emissions

 reductions will also stimulate investment into research and development of cleaner technologies, practices and abatement methods.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No

 Notes
 The only scenario in which an adjustment might be considered necessary is one that requires an even more ambitious target to be
 set, for example if there is new scientific evidence of what is required for a safe climate.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Five-year cycles provide achievable short-term goals that will enable New Zealand to stay on track for meeting its 2050 target.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 Setting firm budgets signals stability and certainty to investors. The likely knock-on effect would be a stimulation of local investment in
clean tech and a stimulation of inflows of foreign direct investment into New Zealand as a hub for clean tech innovation. By contrast,

on-going adjustments to any given carbon budget should only be done so in the context of where targets are being exceeded or
outperformed i.e. if New Zealand is outperforming its targets then the budgets should be revised to sustain forward momentum.




Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
Emissions budgets should not be altered in response to “economic changes” as this undermines their long-term certainty. However,

the ability to revise budgets in light of major changes in scientific understanding or international agreements should be permitted. If
New Zealand is outperforming its targets then the budgets should be revised to sustain forward momentum.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
To reduce cumulative emissions sufficiently to avoid dangerous climate change, the steepest emissions cuts to carbon dioxide must
occur in the first 10 years, with possibly less steep cuts thereafter.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes

We must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Four key issues to consider are: 1. Decarbonising buildings: Adjusting current building standards and codes to support future carbon
targets. A focus on the following areas could deliver positive carbon reduction outcomes: a) All new building stock be mandated to

adhere to green building codes and meet sustainability criteria. The minimum mandatory requirement be at least Home Star 6, in
terms of energy efficiency. Future-proofing new builds should be a primary consideration in terms of capturing the potential for low

carbon emission energy generation and storage (i.e. solar conduit battery use and electric vehicle charging capacity in all new builds).
b) The existing housing stock of 1.8 million homes - 800,000 of which are currently not adequately insulated - represents a significant

opportunity and challenge in terms of reducing emissions, with particular regard to Government’s recent legislation relating to
mandatory heating requirements. These new mandates, coupled with a potential shortage of affordable insulation and energy
efficient heating appliances, suggests that energy-related emissions may be exacerbated by an initial supply shock (where demand

outstrips supply). Government should therefore consider whether the existing policy framework is fit-for-purpose in terms of
transitioning to a low carbon economy and whether New Zealand be looking to other frameworks i.e. that of the UK where energy

rating systems have been introduced, and where subsidies and tax reliefs are leveraged to stimulate investment into and market
growth of insulation and energy efficiency products. c) In view of the forthcoming Building Code review, building standards such as H1

Energy Efficiency Standard (NZS 421:2009), should be reviewed with the objective of mandating minimum standards that deliver
carbon savings through energy efficient buildings. The current requirements are currently inadequate and should be tightened. d)

Introducing a Home Star minimum standard for existing homes – rental homes in particular, as a means of improving the energy
efficiency of existing building stock, while simultaneously addressing social and environmental equity issues, given that rentals tend
to be maintained to a lower standard than owner occupied homes. 2. Renewables and clean tech: Leveraging appropriate policy tools

to support Governments long-term carbon reduction target through renewable energy generation and Electric Vehicle (EV) charging
infrastructure. For example, manage the anticipated large scale uptake of EVs and associated energy demand management,

subsidies and taxes could be leveraged by: - creating an environment conducive to fast-tracking much needed investment in EV
charging infrastructure and incentivising the uptake of EVs in the mainstream / middle / low income market through making 2nd hand

EVs as affordable as 2nd hand internal combustion engine vehicles. - supporting the build out of distributed energy with energy
storage, and/or district heating and cooling (with storage) - sidestepping a potential demand crunch on existing energy sources,
transmission and grid infrastructure. - increasing low carbon utility-scale renewable energy generation (i.e. fast tracking consented

utility-scale onshore and offshore wind and ground mounted solar arrays, hydro energy and more). Encourage investment into
infrastructure that supports nascent technologies such as - hydrogen fuel cells Domestic food security: Transport emissions

associated with increased food imports will negatively weight the carbon budget. A recent report from HortNZ indicates that on the
current population growth trajectory, demand will outstrip future supply of domestic production by 2020. Domestic food supply is

pivotal to carbon targets being met, given that food represents the greatest portion of consumption emissions (32% of Auckland’s
household emissions according to the 2014 report by Motu Economic Research– Greenhouse Gas Emissions New Zealand: A

preliminary Consumption-based analysis (Romanos, Kerr and Will); and food and restaurants accounting for 30% of Auckland’s per
capita consumption emissions according to C40 Cities consumption emissions data report 2018. Careful assessment of land
allocation for housing development is urgently required to ensure that prime growing land is protected from housing development;

that domestic supply of vegetables can meet demand; and that climate change and carbon reduction is embedded in land-use and
planning policy. 4. Public transport infrastructure: Transport accounts for the second-largest share of emissions from households

(27% - Motu Economic and Public Policy Research) and individuals (23% - C40 Cities Consumption emissions calculation). Ensuring
that adequate investment is allocated to public transport infrastructure, particularly in new, high growth areas such as South and

North Auckland, is key to reducing per capita carbon emissions. Plans tabled by Greater Auckland (congestion free network and
Regional Rapid Rail) merit consideration. High deprivation urban areas should also be prioritised and supported with affordable lower
carbon transport options, to ensure that equity issues arising from fuel taxes, for example, are addressed. In terms of key

stakeholders that the government should be working with: If New Zealand does follow the UK Climate Change Act model, it follows
that the NZ Climate Change Act would result in a legal requirement for ALL government departments to be responsible for reducing

and reporting emissions from their own buildings and estate, and for assessing the carbon impact of new policies. Strategic partners
would include: • The government departments most likely to lead on emissions reductions (transport, energy, agriculture/primary

industries, built environment). • All Public Service Departments, Non-Public Service Departments, Crown Entities (Crown Agents,
Autonomous Crown Entities, Independent Crown Entities) and Crown Entity Companies (Crown Research Institutes and Other
Companies). • School Boards of Trustees and Tertiary Education Institutes, Public Finance Act Schedule 4 Organisations, Reserve

Bank of New Zealand, State-Owned Enterprises and Mixed Ownership Model companies. • Community groups. Behaviour change is
pivotal to New Zealand meeting its carbon targets, in terms of reducing household carbon emissions. Communities should be

actively engaged, educated, encouraged and incentivised to prioritise energy efficiency, sustainable travel and low carbon
consumption habits. • Large and medium-sized businesses are also key partners, with regard to their influence in shaping consumer

behaviour and related environmental outcomes. • Local Boards, councils and community groups hold valuable knowledge in terms of
material opportunities in any given area and holding valuable insight into effective community engagement methods; and effective

programme deployment. These organisations represent the interests of communities, business, NFP and NGOs across New Zealand,
all of whom will play a vital role in leading the cultural change and behaviour change required to move New Zealand to zero emissions
future.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
The Commission should not be a decision-making body. However, the Government should be legally required to consider and

formally respond to the Commission’s advice, and to provide an explanation if they do not act on it.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to
the number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes, in terms of ensuring that risks are well understood and that the policy framework in place addresses such risks and enables

decisive action to be taken to diminish, mitigate or preempt risks.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

Mandated reporting requirements will serve to improve transparency and will assist organisations and Government in more effective
risk management.
