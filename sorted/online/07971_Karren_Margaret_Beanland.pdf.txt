Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Karren Margaret Beanland








Reference no: 7971

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes
 I think the initial focus should be on CO2 because these emissions can be address through transport changes and energy efficiency,
 which will have long-term benefits for the economy. It would be a good goal to stabilize short-lived gases such as methane, but we

 need to recognise that this may be harder to achieve. Also, shorter-lived gases are associated with the agricultural sector, which is
 producing food. That sector should be encouraged to import but it could be done over a longer timeframe. We should tackled the

 easier areas first, which is CO2.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes
 The emphasis has to be on schemes that have strong environmental and economic safeguards.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Add Treaty of Waitangi implications



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The focus should be on energy efficient transport policies and energy efficiency - use of solar, wind technologies, energy efficiency in
the building sector (housing, electricity supply regulations to support the use of solar panels on houses by selling back to the grid),

support for use of electric vehicles even it is expensive while the country is building up the EV fleet, promotion of public transport and
alternative forms of transport such as walking and cycling (eg: make it free for school age children and students to use public

transport)



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes
Governments should not be able to subvert the ETS by having a low carbon price as we have seen in recent years.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
I really want to see a focus on CO2 reductions through energy efficiency and better transport options. Adaptation - and the costs of
adaptation - need to be handled very carefully. This area requires careful consideration and I would not want to see this become the

focus of the bill.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
