Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes
 There is no point in getting too far out front when it is clear that many developed countries are not meeting their commitments. see

 http://www.iflscience.com/environment/only-three-eu-countries-on-track-to-meet-paris-climate-agreement-targets/



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes
 With the recent publication of Myles et al (2018) on a new way to consider methane emissions in a much more environmentally

 sustainable way in comparison to the flawed Global Warming Potential (GWP) method promoted by the IPCC and used by
 governments, for the consideration of relativities with CO2 there is an opportunity to reduce some costs, by the adoption of realistic
 methods. Prof David Frame and our previous Climate Commissioner Adrian Macey (both from Victoria University) are co-authors in this

 publication. see https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-018-0026-8, and
 https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/news/2018_news_Climate_Pollutants_GWP . If this method is to be adopted, (and the science
 suggests this is a much more environmentally sustainable way to consider methane), then nitrous oxide should be treated similarly

 as this gas has a only half the half life in the atmosphere of CO2.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 NZ should not be purchasing international carbon credits to meet commitments particularly when many developed countries are not
 meeting their commitments, and are not prepared to purchase such credits.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 In the event that a) the climate doesn't continue to warm (there has been no warming for the last two decades, see

 https://ktwop.com/2015/08/09/climate-models-would-fit-data-better-if-they-drastically-reduced-carbon-dioxide-forcings/). b) other
 developed countries continue not to meet their emissions reductions commitments, c) new science modifying assessment of
 climate warming, and or the effectiveness of total emissions reduction becomes available. In a peer reviewed paper Bjorn Lomborg

 has noted that if the present commitments signaled by all countries are carried on to 2100 then at a cost of about $US one trillion /
 annum, the total effect on temperature would be -0.17 degrees C by 2100. Further he has noted that for every one dollar spent,

 there would be a benefit of about 3 cents see file:///C:/Users/Jock/Downloads/Lomborg_in_The_Oz%20(8).pdf. If this is correct then
 we should take a serious look at the proposed plans to commit $billions to reducing emissions.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 There must be considerable flexibility in following the situation when there is no guarantee of continued world warming, or what the

 world climate will do in time going forward. There isn't even good information showing that CO2 causes most of the modest warming
observed to date. I note that the NZ Royal Society, and Professor James Renwick have been asked recently by the NZ Climate

Science Coalition, to provide one scientific reference (not based on modelling) showing that CO2 is the main cause of global warming
(which we haven't had in the last two decades) no specifications in published papers have been forthcoming.

Clause
6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

Position
Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

Notes
Any resident Govt, or incoming Govt has the right to change any policy.



Clause

7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes the Government should have that power.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Particularly when the scientific assessments have changed. The Climate Commission should instigate a forum on issues in debate, a)
NZ's temperature record. NIWA say + 0.9 degrees C in the last 100 years, b) Independent analysis of the same NIWA data, using the

same analytical methods NIWA claim to have used say +0.28 degrees C in the same period. Both estimates are published in the
same scientific journal, NIWA should be expected to attend a scientific resolution of the difference. Thus at the moment New Zealand

does not have an agreed official temperature record (NIWA's words).



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
No

Notes
No, the government in power must have flexibility to govern. No one has any real idea of what the climate is going to do going

forward. The computer models of the IPCC, research institutions and member governments seem pretty sure that projections will
come true. However in the last 20 years the satellite and balloon measurements have shown almost no warming in the last 20 years,

in spite of the CO2 levels in the atmosphere increasing by more that 10%, and a period when about 1/3rd of all the human emissions
have been emitted see . http://www.drroyspencer.com/wp-content/uploads/UAH_LT_1979_thru_June_2018_v6.jpg. The atmospheric
record are the most accurate available, as they cover virtually all of the globe, not just the 25%+ that land based records cover. In

addition the atmospheric records do not suffer the Urban Heat Island effect of intensive settlement etc. Further there are some
suggestions that with very low levels of sunspots, there is a possibility of some cooling in the next few years, see

https://wattsupwiththat.com/?s=Svensmark



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

1. Evidence that CO2 is causing climate change or warming, empirical evidence, not climate models. 2. Evidence that reduction in
human emissions will have any effect at all on climate / temperature. it is noted that between 1990 and 2013, the world's human

emissions have increased 60% (http://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/allaboutfinance/chart-global-co2-emissions-rose-60-between-
1990-and-2013). Clearly all of the Climate Conferences held world-wide in the past 20+ years have not been translated into any

effectiveness in world emissions reductions, or any suggestion of same. Further the world emissions increased another 2% in 2017.
It is not "who do we need you work with" The requirement is to get the science correct within our own grouping, clearly the "global
warming" mantra presently is Government Policy, with scant regard for the actual scientific data. 3. We see and hear the Minister of

Climate Change stating that now we have more storms, higher temperatures, wildfires, droughts and floods, all as a result of climate
change, when in fact it is impossible to define what parts of the weather / climate are due to natural variation, and what is due to

human effects.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Notes
As emissions reductions are unlikely to have any significant effect on climate change, better preparedness for adverse climatic

events, is a sensible policy for any responsible government.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
No

Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
I will write re some other climate issues for the use by the Climate Commission. Please conform that when this is done and sent to

the Ministry of the Environment, that my submission will be forwarded to the members of the Commission. Many thanks, Jock Allison
