Reference no: 12833


Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later

 Notes
 On balance, I support setting a 2050 target in legislation now. Setting a target will promote political accountability, clarity, and long-
 term certainty. There are, however, some good reasons to seek advice from the Climate Commission about the 2050 target. In

 particular, it might be a good idea to ask the Commission to provide expert advice on complicated parts of the 2050 target, such as
 the “sustainable level” for short-lived greenhouse gases. Setting separate targets for the different greenhouse gases is an option
 that should be considered by the new Climate Commission.




 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 I support a 2050 target which is ambitious, clear, and science-based. Accordingly, I support the most ambitious option: net zero
 emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050. However, not all gases are equal. Science recognises the difference between long-
 lived greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide) and short-lived greenhouse gases (such as methane). I support

 a differentiated approach to managing these two groups. Therefore, achieving a net zero 2050 all gases target would mean:
 Combining the mitigation of long-lived gas reductions with carbon sinks (through forestry and carbon sequestration in soil) to achieve
 negative long-lived emissions by 2050; and Reducing short-lived gases to low, sustainable levels. This would balance out to net zero

 across all gases, but in the most impactful way possible. Short-lived gases do not need to be reduced to net zero to stop
 temperature rise. They only need to be stabilised. New Zealand should aim for a sustainable level of short-lived emissions which fits

 with the Paris Agreement goals to keep global warming well below 2C, striving to 1.5C. Long-lived emissions, however, contribute to
 global warming until they are reduced all the way to zero. Because these gases exist in the atmosphere for millennia, finding ways to
 absorb more of these gases from the atmosphere than the amount we are emitting (known as “negative” emissions) is the most

 ambitious and impactful contribution New Zealand could make to counteract global warming. Accordingly, the Zero Carbon Act
 should prioritise reducing long-lived emissions to net zero, and then to negative emissions, by 2050 or sooner.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 I support NZ reducing emissions domestically - not using international carbon credits to contribute towards emissions reductions .

 Domestic reductions are an investment in our own economic and social development as we transition to a carbon neutral future.
 Relying on international carbon credits (even if the credits have integrity) creates uncertainty about what reductions need to be
 achieved in New Zealand and doesnt create the right signals to business and others about their activity. I prefer a transparent

 approach which separates international contributions from our domestic Zero Carbon Act targets. This would not stop New Zealand
 from purchasing international carbon credits as an additional contribution to global mitigation efforts. Purchasing credits helps other
 countries finance their transition to a zero carbon economy, especially developing countries.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes

 The 2050 target should only be revised in exceptional circumstances. The purpose of the Zero Carbon Act is to provide
 accountability, certainty and flexibility. It will provide accountability and certainty by setting clear, legally-binding emission reduction
 targets. It will retain flexibility by permitting different governments to use different policies to meet these targets, in response to

 changing circumstances and new technology. Despite the importance of accountability and certainty, there are some situations
 where it is appropriate to change the 2050 target. For example, if there is a significant change in scientific knowledge or international
 law (such as the Paris Agreement becoming more ambitious). Any revision should require input from the Climate Commission and

 approval by Parliament. I do not support being able to revise the 2050 target in response to “economic changes”. The opportunity
cost of investing now in transitioning will be significantly higher the longer we delay.




Clause
5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
Position
Yes

Notes
I support this proposal. Legally-binding budgets, set 10-15 years in advance so that three budgets are in effect at all times, at a level

recommended by the Climate Commission and approved by Parliament, are a cornerstone of the Zero Carbon Act.



Clause
6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

Position
No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

Notes
I don't support budgets being changed. Budgets should only be revised in exceptional circumstances. If an incoming government

was able to alter the budget, it would create too much uncertainty and instability. A new government can introduce different policies
to meet the upcoming target



Clause

7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Under exceptional circumstances, yes. For example, it might be appropriate to change an upcoming budget after an extreme natural
disaster (such as a major earthquake). Revising a budget in this situation would not mean changing the long-term 2050 target.




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
I generally agree with the proposed list of considerations to take into account when setting emission budgets: scientific knowledge

about climate change technology relevant to climate change economic circumstances and, in particular, the likely impact of the
decision on the economy and the competitiveness of particular sectors of the economy fiscal circumstances and, in particular, the

likely impact of the decision on taxation, public spending and public borrowing social circumstances and, in particular, the likely
impact of the decision on fuel poverty energy policy and, in particular, the likely impact of the decision on energy supplies and the

carbon and energy intensity of the economy the government’s obligations under the Treaty of Waitangi the three government
objectives for climate change policy: sustainable economy, global and local leadership and creating a just and inclusive society



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

I support the Zero Carbon Act having a strict time frame for setting out policy plans. This time frame should be 6 months after an
emission budget has been set.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable,
and reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi. For an explanation of these principles, see the section above about “Zero Carbon Act

principles”.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

Yes. I support the Climate Commission having two functions: (a) providing expert advice, and (b) monitoring our progress and holding
the government to account. The Commission should not be a decision-making body.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

I generally agree with the proposed list of expertise which should be collectively held by the Climate Commission: climate change
policy (including emissions trading) resource economics and impacts (including social impacts, labour markets and distribution) te

Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori interests climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori
experience with addressing adaptation challenges like planning, insurance and local government risk management engineering
and/or infrastructure community engagement and communications. Desirable, but non-essential, expertise could include: business

competitiveness knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology development system. Missing from this proposed list
is expertise in public health. A further consideration is that, if adaptation is included in the Zero Carbon Act (see Q14), it will be

important to think carefully about how many Commissioners should have adaptation-specific, and working with communities,
expertise. It might be a good idea to have a separate committee which focuses on adaptation issues, as is the case in the UK.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes. Generation Zero supports the government being required to prepare a national climate risk assessment, and a national policy

plan to address these risks. A monitoring and reporting framework is also important. Local Councils should be involved in these
processes.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
I support NZ taking responsibility for our global emissions and the climate impacts that we have contributed to. It’s very important that

all New Zealanders have their say on how we make the shift to a zero carbon future here in New Zealand but we must also help the
world’s most vulnerable communities across the Pacific adjust to the impacts on climate change. To ensure that the Zero Carbon Bill
is transparent, I support the Bill including a requirement to produce annual reports about New Zealand’s international climate change

contributions in order to ensure that the Pacific countries get the support they need and can plan to adapt to their changing
environment.
