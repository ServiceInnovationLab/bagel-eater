Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Gregorius Brouwer








Reference no: 9259

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 The sooner the better. We need to be forced, or else it is not going to happen, as we have seen time and time before.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 Or sooner / earlier



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 I don't trust overseas carbon units, that you cannot control yourself. By all means, do them as well, but don't count them for your own
 achievement.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes

 yearly budgets. 5-yr budgets give reason to push achievement to later in the 5 years, which might then fail to happen.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 New governments may be less committed to this cause and scrap the good plans. Not acceptable.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
 No, as a principle. In reality, if the circumstances make achievement impossible, they will change it anyway. But it should be made
 near impossible.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Action asap, not so much hui, more-do-ie




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

It is not of this time anymore that Economic and financial bodies have decision making powers, over the government, but the CCC
itself advises that it would only be advisory. This is the biggest issue facing us, since WW2, and you propose to keep it advisory. Not

good enough.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes

Separate document / commission / platform. Too many issues lead to too much talk and no action.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

cannot find any functions on page 47



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
sure, why not.




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
2 issues. Action should be taken now. Not plan-plan- and plan a bit more. Of course, do both, plan well, but do stuff now. The extra
taxes on fuel are a good idea. I would also like to see, really soon, buy-back subsidies or other stimuli for households and industry

feeding electricity into the net. Secondly: i consider myself green, but weak of resolve. I want to make green choices, but often don't
because 'my neighbours' (in a wide sense) do not. Point to make: I want to be forced to act green. That is why I voted for this

coalition government to come about. Thank you for your ear.
