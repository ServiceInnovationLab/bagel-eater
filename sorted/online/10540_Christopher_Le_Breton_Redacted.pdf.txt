Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Christopher Le Breton








Reference no: 10540

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes
 There is additional data complicating policy which the Climate Change Commission will need to take into account, namely, for

 instance sea level is not yet rising consistently, in some parts of Tuvalu it has registered as having gone down, and new land has
 been created as a result.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 Mindful of any changes that the Climate Change Commission deems important



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes

 Massive investment in train services so that there is a valid alternative to flying, and transporting goods easily and safely. Electrifying
 trains are the way using central Otago HEP/



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Mindful of any changes that the Climate Change Commission deems important



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Subject to massive investment in expanding trains. Hypothecate funds raised and put them into raising the quality of the rail

 infrastructure.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
Work with KiwiRail to consider what they need to take over responsibilty for internal NZ travel from Air New Zealand.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

(NZ ETS)?

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Excellent criteria proposed.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes

Yes. Give local authorities the powers to enforce this, and remove the ability of people to chop down mature trees as they wish.
Mature trees are net oxygen providers to the atmosphere (unlike trees less than 25 years old).




Clause

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Ensure that there is proper consultation with Te Ao Maori. There are ways and means of knowing that don't fit within a
western/cartesian planning system, and as they cannot be verified by science, can often be overlooked. NZ has a rare international

opportunity to draw on both modern science (Newtonian and Quantum) and other forms of knowing in Te Ao Maori.
