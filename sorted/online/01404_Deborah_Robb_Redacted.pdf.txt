Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Deborah Robb, Deborah Robb









Reference no: 1404

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes
 Action is now urgent. The climate commission will advise how we are going to achieve our target. The sooner it is set the earlier the

 signal for change is sent.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes
 To take people with us we need to be fair and agriculture doesn't have an answer for short-lived gases yet.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 I have no faith in buying emission reductions. It send a bad message and is unfair on those who can't afford to 'cheat.' Which is how I

 view all trading of carbon responsibility. Shouldn't be an option.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Notes

 Only if the science changes Not The Politics!



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Notes
 Only if the science says we need to reduce emissions faster than the budget dictates. Otherwise no.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Notes
 Not sure. I have no faith in politicians to make the right call unless the government was Green. But dislike binding us to something
 long term when future is unknowable.



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
Clarity is required to get buy-in.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Science first. How other intelligent countries have done it. Equity of effects on people




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes

Think the ETS is a waste of time.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes

They are separate issues. Adapting being secondary and can be managed by central and local govt.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
Climate change has been my main environmental concern for 25 years! I am very frustrated by the slowness to act and cheer on this

government's resolve to legislate to reduce emissions asap! Vital work.
