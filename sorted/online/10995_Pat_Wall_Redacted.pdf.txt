Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Reference no: 10995

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 I feel that to treat CH4 as a flow gas, and therefore to let the agricultural sector off the hook for CH4 emissions would be a grave
 mistake. While I am sure there are political implications, I feel we must listen to the science. The fact is that CH4 is not only a far more

 potent gas in terms of short term warming, it also oxidizes to CO2 in the atmosphere and thus continues to warm in the longer term
 as well. So, any emission of CH4 (NOx as well for that matter), poses a far greater threat than if it were just CO2 emitted in the first

 place. Furthermore, to differentiate between recent and fossil carbon is a slippery slope in regard to CH4 especially. We must
 remember that there is also enough "recent" carbon locked up in the land to burn us to a sizzle. To allow agriculture an easy out
 would potentially give license to increased activities that continue to increase the removal of recent carbon into the atmosphere. We

 want to be locking more away rather than releasing more of that recent carbon. Allowing agriculture to continue business as usual is
 akin to burning our forests. We would be taking something that may have been locked away for 50-200 years, and re-releasing it. We
 MUST draw down both short term and long term gasses, regardless of if they come from recent or fossil flows. I feel this is kind of like

 asking us if we would rather flood the bathroom floor with water from the tub or the sink. The end result is still the same and it is what
 we want to avoid in the first place.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes

 Strong safeguards cannot be emphasized enough. I feel it is a good idea to possibly be able to provide income streams to poor areas
 in exchange for protecting forests. However, since such areas and schemes are prone to injustice and corruption, this must be
 watched closely.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 It should be allowed to bring the date forward, but not push it back.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
Notes

Yes in theory, but it should not be able to be used as a political football or to kick the can down the road.



Clause

7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

I do not like the idea, although I can imagine that there may be a circumstance where this may be useful. I do not like the idea of
giving a way out to lazy political leaders of the future.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The most important thing is that we reach our goal. Along with that we must ensure that we take everyone with us and do not
impose disproportionate pain on the most vulnerable.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
The commission will need teeth and power in order to force politicians to follow through with the task.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes
I do not want political pressures to distort the market.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Absolutely. I feel we need a lot of scientists on board, and we should have people from varied and important sectors as well as people
from all political stripes. This however must be balanced. We do not want the commission to be able to be stacked with people who

want to kick the can down the road. I think there must also be minimum criteria for membership; for instance, an individual MUST
agree that anthropogenic climate change is real, and they must support real action- as a minimum. We cannot allow for voices that

would slow or halt progress.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
I suggest that we not allow local councils to avoid liabilities from landfills. I know that some councils have up to 80% of their carbon

liabilities in landfills. To not take these into account is to miss a very large portion of GHGs from the public sector.
