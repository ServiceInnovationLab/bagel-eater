Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Rarotoka Management Ltd (Anake Goodall)









Reference no: 7706

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 Aim high; this is no time for weak measures and targets.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes
 All initiatives are valid when there is only one planet in question.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Downwards easily, and upwards with great difficulty.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 No

 Notes
 I prefer the PCE's recommendation for six year terms that fit with the electoral cycle.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes
 And with a high accountability hurdle.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 But only with a high accountability hurdle.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

Investors need certainty and early information, and we need investors to effect the changes so they should be supported.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

We need to meet and work with those with most influence on both the emissions and the solutions sides of the ledger.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

I would like to see the Commission established with considerable independence, similar to the Parliamentary Commissioner for the
Environment.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

I support the draft criteria listed but believe that we must add skills in the large scale social change space. This is not just a technical
riddle to solve; it is going to require intentional interventions to bring about a significant change in practices and habits at the
individual and societal levels. The Commission would be well served with this perspective in its number.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
To some extent adaptation measures, and their success, will be part and parcel of the simple emissions target objective.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

I support MfE's recommendations that the Zero Carbon Bill includes the following provisions: • a national climate change risk
assessment • a national adaptation plan • regular review of progress towards implementing the national adaptation plan • an

adaptation reporting power.
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
Notes

This is essential.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Can we get this enacted immediately please; we're guilty of squandering a precious decade already!
