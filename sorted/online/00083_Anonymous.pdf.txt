Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 83

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 Set the target in legislation now, monitor its progress and adjust the the processes for items not meeting the criteria



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes
 The majority should be be domestic reductions, but there is some scope for international carbon units. there is also potential to use
 New Zealand as an offset for other countries, which could prove a good revenue/trade source




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 I think it should be revised, but only if it is beneficial to the environment. i.e if certain items / sectors are not meeting targets, then the

 process in which they are required to reduce emissions should change, provided the new process is more positive for the
 environment



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 the use of the budget should be well setout, but also the funding for the budget could come from initiatives where businesses that
 are high in emissions don't aim at reducing. i.e tax companies on emission but lower the tax threshold when they can prove they are
 actively reducing not only emission, but general consumption of resource (energy, materials etc) year by year




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes

 the budget should only be able to be changed, but only under the circumstances where emissions have reduced over the first
 decade, or more budget is required to reach the targets should they not be achieved



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

the companies producing the emissions need to be consulted and aided in ways to reduce their emissions, particularly if they want
to lower them but the prospect seams expensive, to see what they require in the way of making their business emission free.

Governments like Denmark and Finland should be considered too, and consulted about what works and what doesn't, since they
have set a high precedent



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

it should be able to make its own decisions, based on research and experience, although it should be reviewed and scrutinized by
the government, with final approval being given only once all parties agree



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
in the Our Climate Your Say Document, it says desirable but not essential. I agree with these statements although if they do not find a
representative in those areas, there should be someone appointed to find and consult with experts in that area.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

the fact that we are creating a Zero Carbon Bill is a great start to a bright future or New Zealand, but we should not act on the climate
halfheartedly. the positive changes need to happen fast, be bold and be effective. We cannot sit around discussing options of what to

do while the climate changes past the point we cannot correct it.
