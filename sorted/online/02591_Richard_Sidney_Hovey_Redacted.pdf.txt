Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Richard Sidney Hovey








Reference no: 2591

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 It's critical we put in place a firm target now to start working towards if we want any chance of managing the transition process - the
 longer we leave planning, investing etc the steeper the cuts need to be and the harder to make them.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 Zero needs to be zero, and even then the zero by 2050 target is based on only giving us a reasonable chance of avoiding truly

 catastrophic climate change impacts which we'll be inflicting on future generations.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 We should know by now that we can't buy our way out of our obligations. We need to be real and honest about our efforts.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 If there is a global effort to move faster, spurred by the impacts of climate change appearing faster than is currently projected then we
 should definitely be able to speed up our reduction process and if by some incredibly slim chance there is something like massive

 volcanic activity which reduces solar radiation and we are just focused on staying fed we could adjust the target timing.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Five years seems like a reasonable amount of time to be planning and implementing.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes
 There should be no way for an opposition party to campaign on reducing any budget amount unless they will at least make that up in

 the subsequent five year block.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
Yes

Notes
If there is something like massive volcanic emission of material such as sulphur dioxide into the upper atmosphere such that there is

significant climate impact then we should be able to adapt to that.



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

And no opposition party should be able to campaign without firm plans on how they would achieve the emission budgets if they are
proposing different action to the current government.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The actual hard reality of meeting those budget and how to be able to not just pick off the easier 'low hanging fruit' initially then stall.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Actual engineering/infrastructure construction/implementation experience not just political and management.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes

Adaptation is a separate issue.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

I think adaptation to climate change should be in a whole separate area as adaptation to the changing environment will need to cover
other areas of degradation/change that stress our ability to maintain civilisation as we know it.
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

While the 2050 date and the idea of staged five year emission budgets might convey a calm, considered process we need to keep in
mind that right now in almost any given week in New Zealand we have housing, infrastructure and agricultural output being destroyed

by weather related cold, drought, flooding and wind with invasive species being enabled and diseases spreading. What we might plan
at our pace within our considerations of GDP and 'political reality' actually has no relation to the speed at which the climate is
changing and the impacts are appearing. To do anything less than put into legislation the most ambitious emissions reductions we

can is to lose any chance of getting ahead of the pace of the changes we've already started. We throw not only caution to the wind,
but the basis of our civilisation.
