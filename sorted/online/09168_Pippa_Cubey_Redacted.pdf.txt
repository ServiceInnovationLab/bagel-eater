Reference no: 9168


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 We need to act strongly now to aim for the best possible outcome, it already may be too late by 2050.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 The government should consult widely with the best scientific knowledge available and with iwi and communities. We should go with
 the actions that will give the best emission reductions, learning from overseas expertise and local knowledge.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 The target may need to be earlier than 2050, depending on what research shows us and if resources to do this make it possible.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes
 But ONLY if it doesn't slow the process of reducing emissions.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
Notes

Yes, but there need to be weightings so that the environmental impact is given most weight.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The needs of communities who may be adversely affected economically by plans to meet budgets must be considered. Taxes may
need to be increased to provided new economic ventures for these communities. The low paid should not have to bear the burden

of change.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

There need to be safeguards to ensure the Commission has teeth - if it is purely advisory it could be ignored by future governments if
it's advice is seen as too hard.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
I have lived beside the Makara river in Wellington, less than 1km from the coast for the last 20 years. Over the last ten years, flooding

and storms have become more frequent. Or community is at risk of disappearing completely if we do not slow climate change. As a
middle-low income family, our home is our only asset, and our children's heritage. But more importantly, I want my children and their

future children to be able to grow up in a safe environment, which will almost definitely not be possible unless we take very clear and
brave actions to slow the current climate change. New Zealand is in an ideal situation to take a global lead on this matter, we can't

afford not to.
