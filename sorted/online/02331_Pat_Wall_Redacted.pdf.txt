Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Pat Wall








Reference no: 2331

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes
 I only favor option two because I feel that it MAY help to preserve or expand forested areas in developing nations. This MUST be
 strongly policed to ensure that it is not scammed. This could provide a win-win.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 The only acceptable alternative should be reaching carbon zero ahead of time. It should not be accepted to keep pushing the date

 back.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes
 I support this in theory, only because I realize that it might be hard to accurately consider all options so far ahead. My concern is that
 this should not become a tool that allows elections to be run on the premise of lowering targets, thereby kicking the can down the

 road. However, on the other side of the coin, if three lax targets were set by a lazy government, I would support a visionary
 government being able to review and set stricter targets.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
Notes

Only under exceptional circumstances and only with cross party majority support.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
I think that the availability of technology to enable a certain outcome needs to be considered. It may be that new tech becomes

available that allows for greater gains to be made, thereby potentially setting the goalpost higher. Certainly the economy must be
considered as well. That is not to say that the government should kick the can down the road for the benefit of a few industries. It is

actually to say that if some sector or part of society is having trouble keeping up, there should be assistance from government to aid
with transition. This might be new tech for industry or it might be training for people who lose jobs when an industry fails, or it might

be assisting the least fortunate so they do not suffer more than more fortunate people. In a perfect world, the least fortunate would
be trained to help implement the new technologies required in the new economy.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
I would like to see the Climate Commission be an agency with teeth, that holds government to account. I do not want a Climate
Commission that is pushed around or even dissolved by the government of the day. We cannot risk having a change of government

undo all of the progress that was made by the last.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

I think the Climate Commission should take the lead and not allow lazy governments to hand out free passes.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Certainly the commission should have a wide range of expertise and it should have a very large contingent of scientists from several
disciplines (climate, ocean, agricultural etc.), and they should not be outnumbered by economists. Economists are important, but

they should not have the last word. I also feel that the commission should represent all political sides, providing a balance so we do
not have the commission stacked by a government that does not want to take real action.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

I believe that a free market society will not respond fast enough due to the fact that those with a risk of stranded assets tend to try to
slow or halt change. We need directives set out and pathways to get there. This might force those with skin in the game to help the
transition rather than hinder it.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Once again, the legislation must have teeth and not be something that can be pushed aside by the next government. There must be
consistency. We can not afford the back and forth that we have had since National pushed aside Simon Upton. We cannot have this

be a political football. We must be united. Furthermore, we need to communicate to the public that the government will need to use
tax money to help industry and individuals transition. To some, this will sound like socialism and there may be push back. However,

we all pay taxes to be used for the greater good and they should be used to help NZ as a whole to transition. Whether that means
helping the dairy industry to kick coal, or if it means helping a poor west coast community to transition or poor families to retrain; then

so be it!
