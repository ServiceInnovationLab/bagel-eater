Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Jean, Wignall






Reference no: 11429


Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes

 2050 is too late. We need a zero emissions target in legislation now but with an earlier date for achievement.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 All green house gas emissions should be included. The target date should be much earlier. (When we talk about short-lived
 methane, we need to remember that it breaks down into long-lived CO2.)



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 Emissions trading is misguided. It is pushed by fossil fuel industries because it allows them to continue with their profitable

 businesses while giving the illusion that money can clean up the mess. The only solution is to stop producing the gases. I quote
 George Marshall's book, Don't even think about it: "Emissions trading turned out to be a mechanism of byzantine complexity that
 distributed responsibility and severed the connection between personal behaviour and moral responsibility. With trading, it made no

 difference whether you flew or drove or whether you bought electricity from a wind farm or a coal plant - the emissions had already
 been decided and allocated as permits. Nor did it even work. .... By 2013 polluters had banked so many cut-price permits that they

 could expand emissions enough to outweigh the savings of all the European renewable and energy efficiency efforts combined."
 (p165) Rather than carbon trading, we need to prevent emissions from happening in the first place, using regulation, taxation and
 rationing.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Kind of a silly question. At some point, it's going to become impossible for even the most blinkered to ignore the floods, fires and

 crop failures that already pepper the evening news bulletin, and there will be public pressure to reduce emissions more rapidly, at
 which point the target date would be changed anyway.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes

 Smacks of carbon trading thinking. If you set a budget, you'll use all of it. I don't see how setting budgets sends the right message
 about the urgency of reducing emissions.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes
 see above - budgets are a bad idea.



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
What about health and equity? There is far too much emphasis on protecting businesses and profits. You don't seem to get how

urgent and dangerous climate change is.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
No

Notes
The only budget should be zero emissions, and the target should be well before 2050.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
The Commission should be a decision-making body, not just advisory.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

And if they've got any brains, they will decide that emissions trading schemes are not fit for purpose, abolish the NZETS and adopt
regulation, taxation and rationing to reduce fossil fuel use.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes
You have no public health expertise in there. This is pretty important. Also you don't have professional communication expertise. We

all know that scientific language does not adequately communicate to the general public about climate change. Clear, engaging
communication is vital.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

There are some very large issues to be resolved around how we deal with the uneven impact of climate change (eg what do we do
about uninsurable/lost housing around coasts, massive changes in the economy such major as downscaling of the aviation industry,

supporting farmers to switch away from animal agriculture, possibly food rationing, certainly fossil fuel rationing, accepting large
inflows of refugees). The language of the proposal suggests that planning for adaptation will mean we deal with it OK. I think we will
actually see a complete breakdown of society.




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
I strongly support climate change legislation. I think the approach is a bit "this is how we do things" and failing to recognise that
climate change is not a standard issue problem. The discussion document reads as if the writers don't really appreciate the urgency

of the problem. The drafters should all be made to read George Marshall's excellent book.
