Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Ulrike Schamall








Reference no: 9497

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 There is no time to delay any decisions as we are already several decades late to start meaningful change.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 We need a holistic view on all climate affecting gases, materials and actions/inactions. This includes looking at short term / long term
 effects and a targeted approach. It also has to include whole life cycle analysis including emissions created outside of New Zealand.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 New forest planting can only be taken into account if it is done for primary forests, not for commercial forestry as this provides only

 temporary carbon capture and will result in additional emissions further down the line. Reduction has to be achieved through a
 behavioural shift (real car sharing, effective and interconnected public transport, walking/cycling, away from consumerism, not relying

 on technology to help us).



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes

 Or only to reduce emissions faster.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes

 It should not be able to reduce the target, only to progress faster.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
See Note 6. The biggest exceptional circumstance of out time is Climate Change. We won't have an economy down the line if we

don't address CC.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

To reduce cumulative emissions sufficiently to avoid dangerous climate change, the steepest cuts must occur in the first 10 years.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Agriculture: life stock density, monoculture, erosion, water quality (down to collector creeks), nitrates, chemicals use Transportation:
trucks, single occupancy motor vehicles, public transport, active modes of transport, share schemes Consumers/retail: single use

items, packaging, container deposit , stuartship



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
We as a nation have to make significant changes in all areas of our lifes. This issue can't be solved by any one group: industry,

transport, individuals. We're in it together. The biggest thing in my mind is a cultural shift to less consumerism (in all its forms) and
more community engagement and empathy. Only such a shift in individuals can successfully change behaviour of business and

Industrie. Governments can support such a culture shift through education, incentives and regulation/legislation.
