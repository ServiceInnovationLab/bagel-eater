Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 1632

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 Net zero emissions is needed. We need to take a radical step if we want the world to follow suit. Our image is a clean green country,
 so the world will take notice of us. We have spent far too much time sitting around waiting for someone to do something. We need to
 make a drastic change NOW.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 No, the only change that should effect this is if situations worsen, and we need to bring the deadline closer.



 Clause

 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
 Notes
 The government needs to invest in startups and established firms which will make a difference, such as companies developing

 electric cars, solar power etc. Provide larger government grants to impact investors who will do this. We need to work towards
 creating better alternatives (eg electric cars), rather than restricting use (eg. massive petrol taxes, although these are a good way to

 raise this extra capital, to a point).



 Clause
 11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

 its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
 Act as a stand alone entity, such as the reserve bank. With its sole goal being to reduce emissions AA WELL AS net emissions.
Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

As above, "Act as a stand alone entity, such as the reserve bank. With its sole goal being to reduce emissions AA WELL AS net
emissions." It should operate independently, removed from politics.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
Absolutely. Increase the consumers awareness to help them make informed decisions with their purchases. Most people don't want

global warming, but feel powerless as they do no know what steps to take. This will help the everyman to make a positive difference.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Impact investing is the key. We must provide better alternatives to the environment damaging goods we are accustomed to. large

established corporates will likely not not make a moral shift, they will only change their ways if their consumers start buying more
environmentally friendly goods. For consumers to do this, there must be better alternatives available, and for this to happen, impact
investing is the solution, from a government to private investing levels.
