Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 11756

Submitter Type:

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 It should NOT set emissions targets. The science is not settled - it is a political football. Allow REAL, science based research, and not

 political ideology.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 None. There is yet to be scientific debate that has not been hijacked by political ideology. Therefore NO targets are meaningful or
 based on fact.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 Don't set any. The Paris accord is a political crock.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 YES - it should be repealed at the first opportunity.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 No

 Notes
 A budget decided by ideology makes no sense. Three budgets make three times no sense.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes
 Repealed as soon as possible.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 Repealed as soon as possible.



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
No

Notes
Climate change is political ideology. The budget can be no better than fraud on a huge scale.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

No
Notes

Climate change is political ideology. Forcing a future government that actually sees sense to stick to the plans of a government that
hasn't got a clue is treason.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Important issue is to realise the climate has been changing since the climate was invented. To pretend massaged figures intended to

prop up a failing ideology in order to place more financial restrictions on the population is beneath contempt.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

The commission is nothing more than a quango and needs to be removed.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes

The commission is nothing more than a quango and needs to be removed.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Jobs for the boys.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
The climate has changed for the last 4 billion years without a zero carbon bill. By the way - without carbon we would all be dead - so

the entire bill is both meaningless, idiotic and scientifically incorrect.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes
Enforced communism isn't an option.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes
No. More organisations having jolly meetings all over the world in the name of saving the planet is laughable.




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Climate change is a band wagon being climbed on by socialist, communist and marxists sympathisers. Basing crippling financial
measures on a lie in order to follow an ideology is the crime of the century. I DO NOT CONSENT TO MY NAME BEING MADE AVAILABLE
