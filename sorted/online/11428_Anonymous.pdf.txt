Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill






Reference no: 11428

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 The Government should pull its head out of its butt and accept that the climate has changed for 4 billion years and will continue to do
 so instead of attempting to find ways to gouge cash from Kiwis to fund socialist despots and tyrants in 3rd world rat holes.




 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 The best target would be one painted on the back of the government



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Notes
 By continuing down its current path of abject stupidity!



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Notes
 Only if there is a larger caliber available



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Notes
 I agree that someone needs a kick in the slats.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Notes
 hahaha do you halfwits know how Government works? If they don't like it they'll change the legislation to what they want.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Notes
 See above



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes

 I agree that the Government and the climate change commission are a bunch of chinless wonders that should be disbanded before
 they destroy NZ completely.



 Clause

 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Notes
 It should set out a zero time frame for the Government to take a long walk off a short pier.



 Clause

 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Well...you know...people that work maybe?




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
Awww come on! Why the would anybody set a goal and then monitor it?




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Notes
They should be planked




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Notes
Of course. They should be long haired hippy pot smoking hop heads with a history of agitation and Communist party membership.

Nothing else will be acceptable. Apparently Sue Bradford is looking for a job.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Notes
Eh? You mean the genetic cloning of the Tuatara's DNA to be spliced with the Kiwi human genome is not already underway? WTH?




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

Do they include the Tuatara?



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Notes

Well who doesn't want another layer of bureaucratic wombledom sucking the guts out of the few remaining taxpayers?



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
How long have you got? I am totally against this proposal.
