Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Lisa Jane McEwan










Reference no: 2504


Submitter Type:

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 Exception: Only to bring it forward as a matter of urgency e.g. Zero carbon emissions by 2040.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No

 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
No

Notes
While I accept that every decision is based on certain considerations, I feel strongly that it would be wrong to base climate legislation

on "the likely impact of the decision on the economy and the competitiveness of particular sectors of the economy". Climate change
action will, undoubtedly, carry economic cost, and will certainly impact certain sectors more than others. The same could be said for

global trade. It impacts on some workers (e.g. garment workers) and not others (e.g. construction workers) - yet we continue with
trade and expect industries to adjust, and individuals to find other careers if necessary. If we were to exempt certain sectors from
their emissions responsibility, we would simply be engaging in a global race to the bottom. For example, if we allow a certain sector to

keep emitting to remain competitive with the same sector in another country, then we are effectively adopting the emissions policy of
that nation. We need to lead, not follow, and the planet can't wait for us to take time over this.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
We need to support farmers in making a transition away from animal agriculture. Beef, dairy and sheep farming is currently

responsible for 44.4% of NZ's greenhouse gas emissions, or 35% of NZ's methane emissions (NZ Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990-
2016, 2018). Methane is a serious concern, with a global warming factor 25 times higher than CO2 (Intergovernmental Panel on

Climate Change, 2006). However, there are growing markets for plant-based foods, and New Zealand is well placed to diversify into a
variety of horticultural crops to meet this growing demand. Our wine industry is relatively recent in terms of New Zealand's trading

history, and yet we have secured our position amongst the world's best. We can do the same with plant-based food crops and
forestry.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

1). I am fully in support of a transition away from individual vehicles, particularly in cities, but this must be supported by a significant
investment in public transport infrastructure. 2) For decades we have heard for about the need to exempt farmers (animal agriculture)

from emission trading schemes. New Zealand prides itself on being innovative. The number-8-wire response to climate change and
emission reductions will not be had through the development of vaccines that inhibit ruminant methane emissions. It will be through

developing clean alternatives to meat, wool and dairy. The movement away from the consumption of animal products and the
adoption of plant-based diets and textiles, is the biggest social shift of our time. Innovators have responded to this - lab grown meat
has already been developed. Lab grown dairy products will likely follow. New Zealand can innovate to meet new market demands, and

could be a world leader in the organic sector (which might also make our 100% Pure brand more honest, unlike the uncomfortable
misrepresentation that it is today). We can do this. We MUST do this.
