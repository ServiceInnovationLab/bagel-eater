Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 969

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 If the Government can set the target earlier to say even 2040 (still 20+ years), the better. Naturally having it progressively staged is
 important to give businesses and individuals time to modify their behaviour including purchases in a planned manner.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 Overseas credits have proven to be miss leading as we are just offsetting our own emissions to other countries. All countries need to
 move to net zero emissions not just some. In addition when NZ did previously allow off shore carbon credits, there where scams




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 The only exception would be pulling the target forward in time not pushing it back




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 No

 Notes
 It should be planned and signaled to everyone how NZ plans to get to Zero emissions. Being up front allows consumers to plan.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 As mentioned above only if the targets can be bought forward (not delayed). If exceptions are allowed then some Governments may
 choose to use the out clause which in the future will end up cost future generations more to deal with the financial costs of climate

 change eg sea level rise and the cost to move whole communities



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
Encourage and help accelerated the uptake of EVs Encourage and help accelerate new large and small scale Wind, Hydro and Solar

electricity generation (not geothermal as it emits carbon, more than Huntly at the moment)



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

As long as the Climate Change Commission can act impartially of Governaments and not be bought or influenced negatively by large
business




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
