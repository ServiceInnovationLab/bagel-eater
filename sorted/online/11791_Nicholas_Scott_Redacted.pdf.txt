Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Mr (Nicholas Scott)






Reference no: 11791


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes

 Government should not reduce CO2.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Notes
 Government should not reduce CO2



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 If it is shown that "global warming" is not directly caused by CO2, Government should have the ability to amend any "global warming"
 and subsequent CO2 reduction legislation. If the underlying cause is faulty, the legislation is faulty.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes

 NZ has a small economy. Using taxpayers money to fight something that has not been successfully proven will hurt the economy, the
 taxpayer, and eventually cause government instability.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes
 As noted in Q4 - If the underlying cause of the proposed legislation is found to be faulty, government must have the ability to change
 any part of it. Faulty reasoning underpinning legislation will cause that legislation to eventually fail.




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 As noted in Q4 and Q6.



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

No
Notes

The underlying "facts" about climate change are not facts at all. The vast consensus of actual climate scientists is that CO2 has no
effect on climate. This negates the whole reason for this legislation.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Dr. Tim Ball, originally of Canada, is one of the most level-headed climate researchers, and actually addresses the science behind

"climate change". He concludes that pre-industrial levels were not actually 280ppm, as widely claimed, but as high as 550ppm. He
also states that climate "science" is a non-falsifiable discipline, which makes it not scientific. If you can't disprove it, how can you prove

it is true? You can't. http://drtimball.com/2013/why-and-how-the-ipcc-demonized-co2-with-manufactured-information/ CO2 is a
beneficial, harmless trace gas that is critical for life on Earth. All life will become extinct at levels below 150ppm. In addition, climate
sensitivity to CO2 (as measured in a lab, not in real life) shows that as CO2 doubles, there is an inverse logarithmic correlation with

temperature rise. i.e. we can emit any amount of CO2 and the temperature will only mildly rise, reaching an absolute maximum of
around 1.5C higher than present. This will not boil the oceans or cause icecaps to melt, nor runaway warming to develop. The entire

reasoning behind NZ government's ideological drive to tax more, is faulty.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

The Climate Change Commission, as with all ideologically driven pressure groups, is going to be made up of government-approved
panelists. History shows that these will not include any nay-sayers, or skeptics, despite there being ample evidence that the whole

thing is a scam. For this reason alone, the panel will be biased, and their decisions will not be impartial.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes

None. The CCC should not exist, ideally. Unless it has actual scientists who can hold an un-biased opinion.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

The only qualified candidates should be those who understand the fundamentals of the actual science behind so-called climate
change. Not those who already have shown allegiance to one side or the other. Picking opinionated scientists is a contradiction in
terms. Scientists have to look at data impartially, rather than show allegiance to an ideology. Otherwise, they are just priests, not

scientists.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
No

Notes
Less taxation will lead to a more prosperous economy. NZ is about the only developed country that has no overtime laws, primarily

due to its small economy. Taxing people more will not increase the economy.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
No

Notes
The less money that is required to be spent (and required from the NZ taxpayer) the better for the economy.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

The NZ economy is small, and fragile. NZ has no overtime laws as they were seen as detrimental to the economy (which in fact, they
aren't, but that's a different story). Obviously, the economy is of critical importance to all NZ-ers. Raising taxes will not help anyone,

except the government. But rule no.1 of economies is that they perform better with smaller governments! So, lower taxes mean
more money for the people. More money for the people means more taxes, which helps the government. But it doesn't work the

other way around. In addition, NZ already has a "brain-drain", whereby all the brightest minds and hardest workers leave the country
for Australia or beyond, as they can far outearn their NZ career opportunities by doing so. This has led to a shortage of skilled
professionals in various areas, something that the government has been well aware of for many years (enough to put in place

procedures for attracting such professionals). By taxing people yet more, for an unproven science is tantamount to economic
suicide. I urge the government to scrap these plans immediately, and put all the money that would be spent on it, into ways of

improving the economy, first and foremost.
