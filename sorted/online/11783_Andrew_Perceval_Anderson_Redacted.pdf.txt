Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Andrew Perceval Anderson








Reference no: 11783

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes
 Ruminants are not to blame for global warming, humans are. Ruminants have a huge role to play in sequestering carbon in soils,
 particularly degraded farmland and grazing lands which have been badly mismanaged. However, growth of ruminant numbers should

 not be encouraged as extra meat would be exported and each country should be able to feed itself, or almost. Exported food does
 not feed many of the poor, but mainly the rich.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes

 New Zealand should encourage some countries to keep their forests.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
Economic growth should not be sought without undoing fractional reserve banking and with it, neo-liberalism which has greatly

exacerbated inequality these last 40 years. Fractional reserve banking encourages the growth of carbon emissions by the rate of
inflation, roughly doubling every 18 years.
