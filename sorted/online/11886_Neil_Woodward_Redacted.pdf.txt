 actually had that ability



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 No emission targets should be set. The whole carbon issue is a proven lie.

Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Irrefutable proof that Carbon is a cause of Climate change does not exist. All the models to date have been shown to be faulty while

the climate keeps changing as it has done for billions of years. Some people are getting very rich off the back of the Climate/carbon
rort and it is past time for our politicians to spend our tax money in New Zealand rather than gift it to unaccountable recipients
overseas.
