Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Kat, Katrina Miller









Reference no: 12612

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes
 2050 should be a latest date, we need to act now. There should be incentive for governments to be ahead of schedule.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 This should be kept within NZ. Bring back the clean green image and lead by example for other countries.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 I think it is good to have a contingency for the unforeseen but we must ensure future governments are not able to override the
 target.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Notes
 I think 5 year budgets have potential to lead to complacency or lack of direction at the start of term. A three year term would be more

 progressive. It could be related to the elected government term, but if this were the case it would need to be clarified or limiting
 control future governments can take.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Notes
 The Climate Change Commission should be the only ones able to make this change. There should be some flexibility to enable the

 commission to reevaluate as new evidence on appropriate action arises.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes
 The definition of exceptional circumstances needs to be clarified. It should only be if the budget is not diverted to deal with the

 exceptional circumstance it would cause a higher environmental risk. This decision should be for the Commission to make not the
 Government.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The Climate Change Commission should guide the government on budgeting.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Notes
I think the climate change commission should make the final decisions and MPs involved should have an appropriate background in

order to work with the commission.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Notes
Climate and Environmental Science does not need to include Matauranga in Maori. It is important to have representatives having an

understanding of Maori kaitiakitanga as well as regional community groups.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Now we need a Bill to make producers responsible for waste generated and transitioning people to living in a circular-economy. This

would also consider developing communities and addressing the sustainable development goals.
