Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Daniel Weinholz




Reference no: 4947

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later

 Notes
 The government should take a more skeptical approach and demand research-based empirical evidence that setting any kind of goal

 for carbon dioxide emissions will have any effect on the global climate at all.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 The target should only be for toxic pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, and not for byproducts of natural life such as carbon dioxide.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Position
 No

 Notes



 Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Listen to some skeptics ... seriously ... And focus on the core issues of governance ... poverty, nutrition, violence, law. Remember that
NZ's entire population is less than a minor Asian city ... NZ could sink into the ocean and it would have no effect on the global climate

(assuming that climate change is caused by mankind rather than a natural causes). Instead of fluffing money away on this
nonsensical modern social groupthink, just do what a government needs to do and do it well. Care for your own people.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Man-made climate change has simply been assumed to be true without a rigorous, impartial scientific debate. Claiming that the
'scientific community' has reached consensus is simply wrong, especially when skeptics are pushed off the media platform. The real

question is whether or not we should make any laws about carbon dioxide at all. Consequently, the great majority of these questions
are really quite irrelevant to the reality of the situation. Please just halt the zero carbon bill as it is, put it aside, and use the money to
provide warm, dry, securing housing for the most destitute New Zealanders and their families.
