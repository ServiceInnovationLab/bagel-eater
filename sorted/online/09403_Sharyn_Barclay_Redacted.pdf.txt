Reference no: 9403

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes
 The goal ought to be net zero emissions by 2030




 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 The goal ought to be net zero emissions by 2030 but if 2050 remains, Net Zero Emissions are required



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Notes
 Domestic reduction ought to be separate from international units, and could even be via a Carbon Tax - this tax should not
 disadvantage the poor, so could be exempted via community services card. Forest planting is preferably native NOT pinus radiata




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 As said 2030 ought to be the NZ emission reduction target




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 Emissions budgets are required for each parliamentary term of office, so 3 yearly



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Notes
 As said the goal for net zero emissions should be 2030 with budgets by consensus/referenda



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes

 2030 please

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes

 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

 Position
Yes

Notes
But just do it!




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Time needs to be considered so that setting plans is achieving plans!
