Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Murray Chubb





Reference no: 11158

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes
 I believe the Climate Change Commission is ONLY an advisory role. Until all governing bodies can agree on how the greenhouse gas

 emissions impact the environment there should be no legistation set.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Carbon Dioxide - Reducing net carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2050
 Notes

 Methane is part of a biological cyclical process. The net effect on the concentration of methane is none - it is an important cycle to
 create "life" it does not "cook" the planet as we are led to believe. Nitrogen (not the synthetic man made crap) cycle is our vital link to

 our life cycle and food production, with this we have no need to reduce NO2. Carbon emissions sourced from CO2 need to be
 reduced whereas carbon emissions sourced from methane do not need to reduce at all.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes
 The irony of the carbon units trading is laughable - we sell our coal to China and they continue to use this fuel - what has the world

 gained by this???? We should continue to use our own coal and gas which we extract ethically. Renewal energy such as wind turbines
 still hold major issues, how to dispose of the batteries and turbines as I understand they only have approx a 20yr life span, we still
 have a long way to go before we can stand alone on renewable energy.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 FLEXIBILITY is key.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 The Government must set realistic budgets so businesses/individuals can evaluate the impact of these budgets on their
 business/income



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes

 The Government must ensure that they are focusing on pollution and setting realistic goals to ensure that businesses are
 sustainable with minimal economic impact and minimal social impact on communities.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes

 Any Bill, such a the Zero Carbon Bill, should never have a burdening hardship to businesses and people so if this is the case then any
 exceptional circumstances should not alter the continuance of any Bill.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

Who science is the Government adhering to?? Man made climate change is a myth.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The Government must work with all industries to ensure what ever is eventually decided does not have an impact on the social and
economic needs of individuals and on New Zealand as a country. Should farming no longer be the back bone of New Zealand and

forestry becomes the No 1, where will our tourist industry be?? New Zealand covered in trees is not the "look" for tourists!!!



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

We need a Commission to be able to hold the Government accountable for their decisions.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Notes

Advisory role ONLY - this should be a public consultation with public input.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

The Commissioners should have the skill and, knowledge to undertake the role - HOWEVER I go back to the leading question,
desirable expertise??? Scientists are still arguing the true science behind climate change, therefore no Scheme or Bill should be put

in place until the TRUE science has been decided.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes
We are always striving for new innovated technology and more efficient methods.




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

The Government proposal for more trees to be planted in New Zealand leads me to ask this question. Will these trees come about
through requiring land to revert back to scrub?? If this is the case how will land owners survive, what will their income be derived from?

If the trees are to be plantations for harvesting will the Government be held accountable for the forseable disasters that will occur
through the slash left after harvesting (we are already experiencing the disasters) and this will only get worse if the scientists

predictions with climate change are correct with more adverse weather patterns.
