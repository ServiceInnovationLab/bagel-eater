Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill






Reference no: 1334

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 Climate change is a global issue and using emissions reductions from overseas does not address the problem, it just passes it onto
 another country. This is not OK.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No

 Notes
 New Zealanders needs to work together to meet the target and this target needs to be fixed. Having a flexible target detracts from
 the seriousness of the issue and allows people to remain uncommitted.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Notes

 Clear and specific detail needs to be applied to ensue this can occur only "under exceptional circumstances".

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Partnership and collaboration. All parliamentary parties at national, regional and local should be part of the conversation which is able

to be open, honest and transparent and negotiate on the same issue without hidden agendas. Engaging NGO bodies and civil
society is also essential for ensuring sustainable behaviour-change required for addressing climate change.
