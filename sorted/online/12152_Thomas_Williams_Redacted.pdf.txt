Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Thomas, Thomas Williams








Reference no: 12152

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes
 The goal must be that of a balanced outcome. A goal of Zero maybe good for the environmental side, however devastating from an

 economical side. There must be some common ground where a realistic and achievable target/goal can be met. Any advise given
 must be done so from a group with full representation. Meaning all affected parties/sectors have a voice/say. An intention/movement
 towards continual reduction YOY aposed to set time frames is more achivable.




 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 Everything need to reviewable, particularly with some many contributors outside of our control. In addition to continual advances in
 technology and methods of operation.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 Continued reductions YOY would provide a better outcome hence only requiring a line drawn in the sand as to ones current level of

 emission. This level being there max with the goal/requirement of continual reductions YOY.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Notes
 Similar to above, best outcome is for continual reductions.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes

 Similar to above, best outcome is for continual reductions.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes
No weighting must be given to those processes of which produce emissions to create a renewable product vs those producing none

renewable products.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
The law of diminishing returns will apply in an attempt to reduce emissions, if a balanced outcome as stated in question one is to be

achieved.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The generation most affected by these changes need to have a voice. So called farming/rural representatives having take part in
discussions thus far are in my opinion not true/ fair representation of the generation o be most significantly impacted. These are

older farmers who have made their fortunes and have acquired large land holdings. They have capacity/ ability to absorb additional
cost/restriction which affect profitability where as the younger/next generation of farmers doesn't. This may also apply in none rural
based industries.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
But only is the each sector has fair and suitable representation and voting rights.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Who is the most negatively impacted should have equal representation.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes
