Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Joanne Elizabeth McWilliam




Reference no: 9281

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 It is time to get serious about this, be ambitious as a country and get started on the necessary changes.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes
 My understanding is that this option is what is necessary to reduce projected climate disruption. A strong science-based approach

 should be taken to ensure that targets are both appropriate and visionary. The agricultural sector should not be exempted from the
 process but should not be penalised in ways that are not contributing to the overall goal.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 Aotearoa New Zealand should take responsibility for its own emissions. We can see the effects of assuming that other countries will
 deal with our solid waste with the piles of recycling plastic now sitting around. We should acknowledge and deal with our own

 emissions.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Notes
 Only under exceptional circumstances, for example the best science available indicating that alternative strategies may differ from
 what is currently understood. Financial considerations are not enough to change the target.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes

 Only under exceptional circumstances, such as a significant natural disaster.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes

 Only under exceptional circumstances, such as a significant natural disaster. Perhaps in this circumstance the banking/borrowing
 from the following budget concept could come into play.



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

Financial concerns should not be allowed to take priority over the environment.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The Governmentâ€™s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable,
and reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
I support the CCC being an independent body of experts advising and monitoring progress towards the goal.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
Independence is a valuable attribute to maintain, thereby making decision making more appropriately undertaken by government,

who are directly accountable to the public.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

Adding public health expertise to the list would be beneficial.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
This is a reality we need to face and it seems this is an appropriate body to deal with it.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
This is an exciting piece of proposed legislation. We know there are significant and severe implications of anthropogenic climate

disruption. It would be fantastic to see New Zealand leading the way with an ambitious target with detailed and sensible plans to aid
us to meet that target. I am truly looking forward to this being passed - something for our country to be proud of as we take steps to

acknowledge what has happened and change the current trajectory.
