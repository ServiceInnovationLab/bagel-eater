 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes
 All governments need to commit to this target



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 Methane reduction will be needed as well




 Clause

 Notes

 If monitored and changed effectively



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Upwards not downwards or if timeframe compresses due to devastating adverse conditions on the planet. Not for economic reasons

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Timeframe the right length to analyse and adjust if necessary



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes
 As long as not reduced, may need more funding to achieve the goal

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

Pooling knowledge prevents reinventing the wheel as far as remedial action is concerned. Also highlights the extent of problems



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
This is the most vital piece of legislation before the government. Hopefully all political parties can gain some consensus on the
seriousness and urgency of this threat to the planet
