Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Helen Chapman






Reference no: 12455


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 We need to take action on climate change now, a clear target will provide certainty to local government and the private sector.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes
 Carbon dioxide is the most damaging greenhouse gas, so we should place a significant focus on it. Stabilising short lived gases will
 give the rural sector more time t adapt and lessen the shock to the economy that an net zero target for all emissions.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 We have the opportunity to be a world leader in this field - using international carbon credits to achieve our targets would undermine

 this.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 There should be a mechanism to change the target within certain parameters under clearly defined circumstances (e.g. an delay to
 when the target must be achieved if a major earthquake occurs in one of our key cities) - not a wholesale opportunity to change or

 reduce the ambition of the target.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Ideally the emissions budgets would look further out that 15 years - infrastructure and asset planning is often based on 30 year time
 horizons.




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes

 But there should be clear parameters for what changes would be permitted.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

The targets and emissions budgets need to be supported b clear action plans - otherwise we have no ope of achieving them.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Local Government needs to play a key role in the planning process as they make critical decisions about land use, infrastructure,
housing and transport which have significant impacts. It is also important to engage with utility providers and the private sector, but

these groups shouldn't be allowed to capture the process.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

Adaption is critical. Even if we reached net zero emissions tomorrow we would still be faced with the need to adapt to climate change
triggered by historic emissions.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

Targets are useless without a clear consistent framework to monitor progress. This should be lead centrally, currently there is
duplication of effort with different organisations monitoring against different indicators
