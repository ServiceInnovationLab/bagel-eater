Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Deanne Helen Smeaton




Reference no: 1485

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 None. It shouldn't be the Government to tackle this issue, whenever the government tries to change human behaviour it always
 backfires. It should be left to innovative technology which overtime will reduce emissions. Also more study should be done to see if

 human made emission are causing a adverse effects. The planet is over 300 million years old and we only have scientific data from
 the last few hundred years, with only a third being accurate.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes
 See previous comment




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 There shouldn't be targets and carbon credit is just another money revenue, it does not help tackle the issues.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Of course!



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 No

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 As long as all scientific research is taken into account, not just the ones that confirm bias'
Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
No

Notes
Government is not the best to tackle this issue.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
As said above, I don't think government is the best to tackle this issue. But If this goes a head, scientists from both sides should be

consulted, farmers, businesses and other world leaders.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

As long as they aren't bias and don't keep moving the goal post.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
No

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
It shouldn't be the Government to tackle this issue, whenever the government tries to change human behaviour it always backfires. It

should be left to innovative businesses and technology which overtime will reduce emissions. Also more study should be done to
see if human made emission are causing a adverse effects. The planet is over 300 million years old and we only have scientific data
from the last few hundred years, with only a third being accurate.
