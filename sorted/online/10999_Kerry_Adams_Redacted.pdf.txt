Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Kerry Adams, Henry Adams Contracting Ltd








Reference no: 10999

Submitter Type:    Business / Industry

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 No formal targets should be set until there is has been more consultation and other countries are on board. We only contribute

 .017% of global emmissions so disadvantaging our economy at this stage is pointless.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 Do not agree with a Zero target



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 More consultation and a full economic impact assessment needs to be done first



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 More information is required before budgets and targets can be set.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes
 Future governments should not be locked into stupid legislation that is harmful to NZ's economy.




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 As above



 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

 Position
 No

 Notes



 Clause
 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

 Notes
A full economic impact assessment is required. This needs to be carried out by independent experts, to work out the implications

and cost to the NZ economy. The bill does not detail the sectors that are likely to be impacted by the bill. The cost that this will add to
many NZ products and industries need to be calculated and considered.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes

The NZ carbon market needs to be opened up to credible international carbon units.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

Too much voice is given to the Green Party and Forest and Bird. These people are not independent and a firmly set agenda that is
not backed by the majority of NZers.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
We oppose the Zero Carbon Bill as proposed. The current document includes no real economic analysis of the likely impacts of this
proposed bill. The discussion document forecast a significant increase in the price of carbon as part of the consequences of the

Zero Carbon bill. This represents a significant increase in cost of energy for any number of consumers that include; hospitals,
schools, dairy factories, freezing works and food producers. Yet these is no detail on how these increased costs will be dealt with.
