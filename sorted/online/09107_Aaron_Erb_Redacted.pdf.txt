Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes



 Clause

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Yes but only if well reviewed, and broadly acknowledged climate science results indicate a change in target can safely be made.



 Clause

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
Tackling most impacted industries and communities first to provide time to implement path to adaptation. Providing sufficient

research funding and incentives early on to encourage local innovation and entrepreneurial opportunities in meeting requirements.
Expand our green manufacturing and green tech sectors. Establish public-owned green tech incubator investment fund to assist

innovators to bring green products, services, methods & processes to market while retaining ownership in New Zealand. Investment
returns required to be directed toward green investments, research, education, or appropriate improvements in under served

communities. Ongoing consultation, similar to this submission process, on options for meeting budgets. Providing reskilling
programs or incentives for employers to provide the same. Putting high priority on agricultural research to be the world leader in

green farming.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
Generally agree. Regarding business and technological expertise: these are more than desirable, but they concern subsidiary

considerations. That is, we always want to make decisions that make the most of business and technical opportunities up to a point.
That point is that we meet our emissions targets which are set based on science not profit concerns.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Include research on low tech / appropriate tech solutions thereby providing for local community resilience and reduced
environmental impact of solutions (high tech has more unforseen consequences.) Consider military preparedness for increased

resource-based conflicts especially in Pacific. Increase diplomatic work and joint planning with other nations to reduce likelihood of
resource-based conflicts particularly where we could be drawn in through traditional alliances. Consider how to build internal

economy so country can better weather downturns in export and especially tourist sectors.
