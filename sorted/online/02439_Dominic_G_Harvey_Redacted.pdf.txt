Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Dominic G Harvey








Reference no: 2439

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 Without a definite commitment change will be too difficult.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 Having already exceeded all previous targets and with continued high world population growth it is now necessary to set unilateral
 and ambitious targets.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 New Zealand should become a world leader with or without input from other countries.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 There will be significant pressure from industry and other interest groups which will make focussed determination essential.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Provided it is not possible to use this as a mechanism for not achieving the original targets. (Revisionist equivocation)



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 As has so far consistently been the case, this otherwise allows for subsequent governments to not meet previously agreed targets.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
 Notes
 The most likely reason for wanting to do this would be to allow for economic imperatives at the expense of the environment. New

 thinking and policy must be developed.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Subject to new scientific understanding and international cooperation.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

Successive government must be committed to continuity.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The overall and continued health of the ecosystem including a fully integrated human species.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

It is vital to have a strong monitoring agency.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

The NZ ETS must evolve as our understanding of environmental imperatives deepens.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

With care taken to protect impartiality and avoid the influence of industrial or special interest groups. [Pharmacutical and agricultural
multinationals and other nations through trade agreements etc]



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

Given the current starting point and likely levels of progress it is essential that it does.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

Provided those organisations cannot influence policy.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Having spent my 20s living in Kenya where the average energy consumption was 0.5 barrels of oil per year (energy equivalent) and

my 30s in California where people were 90 times as consumptive I am aware of just how far from a sustainable base line we are. As an
Ocean Engineer and Marine Warranty Surveyor I spent the 90s overseeing the installation of very large offshore oil and gas facilities
including Hibernia and those of the North Dome field offshore Qatar. I moved to New Zealand looking for a more balanced and

sustainable lifestyle for myself and my family. But, apart from the low ratio of people to the environment have not found it here. New
Zealand is in a unique position of being able to use its low population and isolated ecosystem to lead the world in alternative

sustainable living. Whether it chooses to do so remains to be seen. However, I believe like the rest of the world it will soon have little
choice.
