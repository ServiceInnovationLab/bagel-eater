Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

David Anthony Francis, David Anthony Francis








Reference no: 9178

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes
 It is critical to enshrine a meaningful target in legislation but there is additional work to be done to make this practical and achievable.

 Therefore the target and timing should be determined by the Climate Change Commission.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Notes
 Can't answer this on the basis of the previous answer



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes
 This answer is VERY dependent on the quality of vetting of the international units.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 With the caveat that there is no point making emissions budgets if they are unachievable. There must be very strong market signals
 in combination with the necessary regulatory frame works to achieve results.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Clear economic signals, practicality of solutions, funding challenges, economic welfare of the affected




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

The issue is so important that it needs to be de-politicized, hence the need to take decision making out of government hands. We
have to avoid the situation where the policy settings change with every election cycle.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
I would add the "desirable" attributes into the "essential" list



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

The cost of adaptation is intrinsically tied into the justifications for mitigation. You can't look at them independently



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

The climate change situation we face is existential. We need to be bold and address it aggressively, but with practicality in mind. Most
of the technical solutions we require are now already in place (with the exception of practical livestock methane solutions). What is

missing is political will and clear economic signals where the true externalized costs of climate change are included. We also need to
change our mindset and understand that change is coming so we should embrace it and reap the rewards of the many benefits it will
bring.
