10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

I believe that people worry most about jobs that will be lost due to this Zero Carbon Bill. In my opinion making this bill a step further
that creates more jobs in New Zealand and prepare us to stay up to date in a new market that is opening world wide will make people

understand how important it is to be one of the first countries to set such Zero Carbon bill.
