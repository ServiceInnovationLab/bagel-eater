Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Kathryn, Kathryn Rogers








Reference no: 11118

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 I don't believe in a zero emissions target. CO2 is necessary for our food chain and a rise in temperature would enable more areas to

 grow food. A drop in temperature could be more catastrophic.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 A much better target would be to work towards tackling real pollution problems, (like effluent on the beaches every time it rains in
 Auckland). If that can't be fixed, you really think you can solve non existent man made climate change?



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 Use our own coal and oil and gas, produced more ethically than other countries, rather than having to import these from these dirty
 producing countries. We have no answer at this stage to produce enough renewable energy to fill our ever increasing demands and
 how are we going to dispose of the existing wind turbines and batteries when they have come to the end of their lives?



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes
 We need to make sure we are concentrating on pollution and setting realistic goals that can sustain businesses and minimalise

 economic impact and social impact.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes
 Any bill introduced should not be an imposition of hardship on people or business so any exceptional circumstances should not

 impact the continuation of the bill.



 Clause
 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
 Notes
 First of all we need to decide whose climate change science we are following as this whole initial question of the existence of man

 made climate change has not been proven. Many models of doom and gloom have not come to fruition. Nothing should be put in
place until this has been settled.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Notes
That depends on who the "desirable expertise" is. I don't have much faith in the sort of "desirable expertise" the Climate Change

Commission would find. Plenty of people out there who will be prepared to be "desirable expertise" if it means they get to keep their
nose in the trough for a bit longer.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No
