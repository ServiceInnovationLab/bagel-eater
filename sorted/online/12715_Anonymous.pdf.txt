Reference no: 12715

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 Out of the three choices offered, I support net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050 as it is the most ambitious, and
 therefore the most just, of the three options. However, in order to play our part in keeping overall warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius

 above pre-industrial levels, New Zealand should be aiming to have net zero emissions by 2040 rather than 2050. The option I
 support (net zero emissions) should not preclude taking a "two-baskets" approach to long-lived and short-lived gases - we should
 aim for negative levels of long-lived gases by the target date, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. Emphasis should

 be placed on reducing fossil fuel based emissions swiftly given that untapped fossil fuel supplies are a much safer store of carbon
 than biological offsets likes forests which can be subject to fire and disease.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 It is imperative (economically and morally) that New Zealand's economy becomes carbon-neutral as soon as possible - hence the

 target in the Zero Carbon Act should be met from domestic emissions reductions only. However, New Zealand has international legal
 and moral responsibilities to support and assist in mitigation and adaptation in developing countries through mechanisms such as
 additional aid, or perhaps purchasing international carbon credits. These measures should be additional to New Zealand's domestic

 mitigation measures. The New Zealand government should also be careful that the resources it supplies to developing countries to
 mitigate and adapt to climate change empower the local people rather being a form of economic colonisation by stealth.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 The 2050 target should not be altered in response to "economic changes" as this undermines its long-term certainty. However, the

 ability to revise the 2050 (or 2040!) target to be more ambitious (for instance, in light of major changes in social attitudes, scientific
 understanding, technological advances or international agreements) should be permitted.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance so that three will be in place at any given time. However, having intermediate

 goals within five-year budgets and annual reporting (at least) against those goals will be important to ensure that emissions
 reductions are not pushed to the end of those periods. The cumulative amount that New Zealand is responsible for emitting up to

 2050 is important - the budgets should be made so that New Zealand's emissions are cut drastically in the first set of five-year plans.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
Notes

Emissions budgets should not be altered in response to "economic changes" as this undermines its long-term certainty. However,
the ability to revise the last budget to be more ambitious (for instance, in light of major changes in societal attitudes, scientific

understanding, technological advances or international agreements) should be permitted.



Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Emissions budgets should not be altered in response to "economic changes" as this undermines its long-term certainty. However,
the ability to revise the last budget to be more ambitious (for instance, in light of major changes in societal attitudes, scientific
understanding, technological advances or international agreements) should be permitted.




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
I agree with the factors proposed in the discussion documents. However, I think that there is should be particular emphasis placed

on the government's obligations under Te Tiriti o Waitangi - climate change action should be used to empower, rather than further
disenfranchise, tangata whenua. The Government and the Climate Change Commission should engage with tangata whenua and

Maori world views when setting budgets. The Government and Climate Change Commission should also be considering fairness
(intra- and inter-generational equity) and environmental sustainability when setting budgets. They should also be taking into account

New Zealand's contributions to international aviation and maritime emissions. The Government and Climate Change Commission
should be applying a precautionary approach when deciding what emissions trajectory that is consistent with the collective obligation
under the Paris Agreement to keep warming to 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. They should also be seeking to front-load

emissions reductions to reduced the cumulative amount that New Zealand emits up to the target date.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes
We must learn from the mistake's of the UK's Climate Change Act and specify a strict timeframe for producing a plan. However, that

time should be sufficient for the Climate Change Commission and Government to engage with the public (particularly tangata whenua
and young people) as to our values and priorities relating to climate change so that we as a society have collective ownership of our

climate action plans.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be comprehensive, fair (within current generations and between
current and future generations), cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and reflect our foundational commitment to Te Tiriti o

Waitangi. In setting plans to meet the emissions budgets, the government should be: - engaging with and considering devolving
power and resources to tangata whenua to enable action on priority areas for tangata whenua. - listening to and considering Maori

world views. - consulting and working with local government to encourage local and regional efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate
change. - engaging with the general public, particularly minorities and young people, about our values and priorities for climate
change action and, if necessary, educating the public about the various options. - considering New Zealand's consumption

emissions (the emissions costs of things done or produced overseas that benefit New Zealanders/are used here) and in particular
the relative consumption emissions and other environmental impacts of the various mitigation and adaptation measures (eg the

emissions cost of producing electric cars overseas). - considering the impact of its current activities on other planetary boundaries
(eg biodiversity, nutrient pollution) and, in particular, the relative impacts/benefits of various adaptation and mitigation measures. -

taking into account New Zealand's contribution to international aviation and maritime emissions and the effects of mitigation and
adaptation policy on those emissions. - making sure they're based on the best science available. - taking into account the
importance of minimising New Zealand's cumulative emissions up to the target date by front-loading emissions reductions. - taking

into account the justice implications of climate change impacts and the relative costs/benefits to already disadvantaged groups of
mitigation/adaptation measures. - ensuring a just transition for workers in sunset industries. - encouraging innovation.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
The Commission should not be a decision-making body - I support the Climate Commission having two functions: (1) providing expert

advice (2) monitoring New Zealand's progress and holding the government to account. However, the Government should be legally
required to consider and formally respond to the Commission’s advice, and to provide an explanation if they do not act on it.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
It is important that the Climate Change Commission have the independence to critique the NZ ETS and to suggest alternatives.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Expertise in public health should also be included, as well as expertise on behavioural and institutional change. People with
interdisciplinary expertise should also be included, as well as respected non-experts (similar to lay-people on disciplinary tribunals).

Expertise in consensus decision making and facilitation will also be important. Consideration should also be given to having
representatives for or from young people and minority groups. There should be strong Maori representation on the Commission.

Gender and other diversities should also be considered when making up the Commission.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within the Climate Commission.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
I agree with having a national risk assessment and adaptation plan but strong engagement with local government and affected

communities will be essential.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

Requiring reporting makes people think about these issues. Information is required before action can be taken.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
As a young person, the Zero Carbon Act process gives me some hope for New Zealand's future. Ambitious action on climate change

is essential if we want to create a more just New Zealand and a more just world. Climate change and mitigation and adaptation to it
will shape New Zealand's future - it is essential to put in place a Zero Carbon Act so that we have the constitutional infrastructure for
action to occur in a just way.
