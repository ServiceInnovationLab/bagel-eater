Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Mr (Mark Drinkwater)








Reference no: 2567

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 No action should be taken other than what the market decides.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes
 If our government insists on going down this fraudulent path, it must make as little change to the status quo as possible.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 We produce less than one per cent of global emmisions. Any action is nothing but vanity on the part of our government at the
 expense of our neediest people.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 The science needs to be uncorrupted by an independant examination of the IPCC and the political structures that fund climate

 research around the world. The IPCC is corrupt and we should not be taxed or regulated because of what this discredited group
 says.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes
 We must have the ability to roll back the power of an unelected regulatory organisation in the future.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 We must have the ability to roll back the power of an unelected regulatory organisation in the future.



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
No

Notes
Despite an overwhelming lack of evidence of any human caused climate change, we citizens are being railroaded into accepting a lie.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

No
Notes

The less regulation the government get to do to me, the better.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Stop perpetuating the lie that the scientific community has reached consensus. It has not. Just ignoring or silenceing those who
disagree does not make for consensus. Government needs to be honest and represent the truth and the will of voters, not cow-tow

to the United Nations, greenpeace or any other non elected entity.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Thats putting the fox in cahrge of the hen house.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes

None at all.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

A climate change commision should not exist.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
Individuals should adapt, not by decree but by natural need.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes
Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Just as Kyoto proved to be a scam, so too is the Paris Accord. How many time does the bias of the IPCC and the environmental media

need to be exposed before this stops? How many more doomsday models need to be proven far from perceptive before this stops.
The establishment of a Climate Czar will do nothing to mitigate climate change. Climate change has always happened and always will.

No scientist can accurately measure the amount of effect people have on the atmosphere. Theories fed to us are always speculative,
drastic and innacurate. This proposition will have a negative effect on the people of New Zealnd. Most of all on the poor, and for what?

A bumch of unfounded predictions made by corrupt scientists propogated by a biased media and enforced by a tyrannical
government. F off with this bollocks.
