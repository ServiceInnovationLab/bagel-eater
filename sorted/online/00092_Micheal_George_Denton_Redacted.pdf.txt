to have paper bags. how come I can buy two 500g margarine cheaper than 1000g how stupid when I was young buying in bulk was
always cheaper bring this back ..... less packets most people around Hawera don't care about using reusable even when they have

seen the state of our oceans its disgusting if they cant change their wicked ways they will have to put their groceries from trolley to
car one at time .we also have serial litters just go to our lovely parks sports grounds and streets bastard people leave takeaway
packets everywhere. there needs to heavy fines for them . I rang the police once they don't police litters and told me to go to the

council . even the council don't care
