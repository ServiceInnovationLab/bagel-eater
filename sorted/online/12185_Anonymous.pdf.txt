Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill






Reference no: 12185

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 We need climate action and ambitious targets as soon as possible. Less mucking around, more forcing a quick transition to a low
 carbon economy.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 As a greenhouse gase, methane is much more powerful than carbon dioxide, even though methane is short lived. Don't let

 Federated Farmers keep repeating that methane is a short lived gas when they don't also say it is a powerful greenhouse gas.
 Methane is very bad in the atmosphere, so we need net zero emissions of it also, by 2050 or sooner.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 We need to clean up our own act and lead the way. Good if we can also help other countries reduce their emissions.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 We should allow the target to be revised ONLY if the target becomes more ambitious. Climate change is a serious and urgent threat
 to the whole planet.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Yes if it forces action to be taken sooner rather than put off until later.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
 The Government absolutely needs to take strong urgent action to reduce emissions. It can't be allowed to get out of it by saying 'it's
 too hard right now.'
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

The Climate Change Commission should not take economic and fiscal circumstances into account when advising on setting
budgets. Urgent and necessary action on climate change has been delayed for too long for fear of hurting the economy or fiscal

circumstances. This has meant worse climate change will come and hurt our economy more than if we had reduced emissions
earlier. Climate change is a huge long term problem which requires ignoring short term economic and fiscal circumstances.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The fossil fuel industry needs to be ignored when setting plans to meet budgets as their industry is killing our planet.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

Governments can ignore good advice. ETS should be set with the goal of drasticly reducing carbon emissions firmly in sight.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes

Keep the main thing as the main thing. Don't distract or dilute the bill's ability to reduce carbon emissions by trying to get it to do
other things as well. Having said that, adaptation should be nationally coordinated.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
