Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill






Reference no: 1748

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 No

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes



 Clause

 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
 Notes

 There are significant economic implications of setting in place legislation for plans and budgets. NZ will face: • slower rates of
 economic growth as a result of higher emissions prices and other transition policies • competitiveness issues in trade-exposed

 emissions-intensive industries • decline in output and jobs for higher emissions sectors



 Clause
 11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

 its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 They should be independent, of no poilitical bias, have science based views from both sides and be proagmatic and objctive. Thye
 should not be influenced by politicians.




 Clause
 14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
 Position

 No
 Notes

 We could face: • slower rates of economic growth as a result of higher emissions prices and other transition policies •
 competitiveness issues in trade-exposed emissions-intensive industries • decline in output and jobs for higher emissions sectors



 Clause
 Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

 Notes
A Zero Carbon Bill will create a vast bureaucracy: A Climate Change Commission, ‘emissions budgets’, climate change adaptation

plans, and emissions targets. Since livestock are carbon neutral, methane from agriculture should not be included in emissions
targets. Without methane, New Zealand would have one of the smallest greenhouse gas emissions profiles in the developed world.

In fact, no gases should be included in emissions targets, because just like the Emissions Trading Scheme, the proposed Zero
Carbon Bill will create a costly nightmare of red tape and bureaucracy that will waste time and money, drag down the economy, and

destroy businesses and jobs – all for no benefit.
