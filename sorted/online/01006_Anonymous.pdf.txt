10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

I think that the Government needs to work with the relevant experts to make sure any plans are that are made are feasible and have
obtainable goals with making sure we reduce our emissions as fast as possible as the biggest focus.

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes I agree with them but I feel like there needs to be more legislation introduced to require transparency on emissions and climate
related activities or business practices. Also the introduction of higher consequences for such activities that are harmful to our

country environmentally.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
Sharing information and transparency is always good as it allows more honest communication.




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
I think that this is one of the most important issues that our country will face, because although it might not seem like a big deal now,

this decision will affect not only the future of our country but the people who live here now and in the future. Not only will it help New
Zealand retain its clean green image but will ultimately help the entire world.
