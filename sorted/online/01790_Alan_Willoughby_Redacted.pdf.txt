Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Alan Willoughby








Reference no: 1790

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Notes
 Net zero emissions is probably unable to be achieved by any date if emissions includes carbon dioxide, the gas you are exhaling now.

 You really want us to all stop breathing?? Carbon dioxide is a required gas occurring naturally and is totally responsible for the ability of
 plants to grow. We are currently in a low CO2 phase - the atmosphere has contained far greater proportions of CO2 before humans
 were even around. CO2 generated by humans, by human activities or caused by any means has little, if any, effect on the climate of

 Earth.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Notes
 Setting any target for gases is both unnecessary and ridiculous. The carbon cycle and climate change have operated for billions of
 years - without these cycles we would not be able to live on Earth. Attempting to stop these cycles by setting targets is about as

 credible as stopping the Earth rotating, and equally dangerous to all life on Earthg.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Notes
 If NZ sets zero CO2 production targets, where will the forest plantings get their CO2 to grow? Sequestration of carbon dioxide is a
 mirage - it all depends on time. You are trying to interfere with natural cycles which have served Earth well for billions of years with little

 understanding of how it all actually works.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Notes
 The only circumstances that are likely to change are that we will more rapidly descend into the next glacial stage, the 29th in the past
 2.5 million years on a fairly cyclical timeframe, and that plants used for food will grow far slower than at present, causing a food

 shortage. If people are still around at that stage, they could possibly review the Bill if they choose.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Notes

 Ah, yes, and we can play our violins as the good ship New Zealand sinks slowly into the final sunset. How we do it is irrelevant; it is the
 doing of it that must be stopped at all cost.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

 Notes
 You really think the government should be bound by decisions made 125 years out without right of change? Governments change
 their mind all the time - why is this any different?




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Not just under exceptional circumstances - mandatory review every month.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes
Yes, and have a referendum of voters before these can be actioned.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
First, we need to look at why this is actually necessary. Every question in this questionnaire is framed in such a way that it is assumed

that firstly this Bill is necessary and secondly, that it is in the best interests of NZ and thirdly that it is a fait accompli and any sort of
input which does not agree with this will undoubtedly be disregarded. It is the death knell for democracy!!!!!!




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
I do not agree or disagree because I do not agree with the goal towards which New Zealand is supposed to be 'progressing' - or

should that be regressing? How is it possible to agree or disagree with a progress when you disagree with the goal????? Prejudicial
question once again.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Notes
The NZETS is also a farcical taxation scheme to provide money for the govt to pay big business for so-called carbon credits. The role

of the CCC should be to demolish the whole system.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

CCCs need to be scientists who are capable of viewing ALL evidence for and against the possibility that humans may or may not be
responsible for a significant amount of climate change, and examine the historical amounts of climate change in pre- and post-human
times.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
No, but I think a few guidelines for ways we can adapt to the on-going and inevitable vagaries of climate would be useful. But that has
nothing to do with the politically motivated ZCB.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes
To what end?




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
I've made a few as I went through. The most important one is that before this Bill is even discussed, there should be a very thorough

examination of unbiased research to see if, in fact, climate change is being driven by human activities. Two questions must be asked
and answered: 1. If the climate changes rapidly in the other direction, i.e. it begins cooling as it has over the past few years, what will
be the response of the government? Maybe to burn oil to produce more CO2? 2. If climate keeps on changing, will that mean that we

will require a less than zero carbon Bill? What will be the government's response when they find, as they will, that regardless of what
they do, the climate continues to do its own thing? No, you won't have thought of these and certainly won't want to think of them in

your idealised, we're in control of everything world. Anyway, I'm just an elderly earth scientist - what would I know? It's my kids and
grandkids I feel sorry for with governments taking the attitude that the present one is with this Bill.
