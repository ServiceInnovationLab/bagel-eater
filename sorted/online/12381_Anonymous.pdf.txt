Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill






Reference no: 12381

Submitter Type:

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 Why would the Climate Change Commission need to advise on a specific target if the Government had already set it's goal as net
 zero emissions by 2050? That doesn't make sense. Also 2050 is way too late to take action we need to act now!



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 Net zero emissions goal should be across all greenhouse gases including methane and CO2.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No

 Notes
 Except in the circumstances where we can go into minus emissions by developing systems and procedures that transform the
 negative gasses into positive and can be used in locked controlled systems that create energy e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?

 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 The Bill should require Governments to set out how it will achieve the emissions budgets, including transition pathways.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 Unless they are changes that get us to zero emissions targets quicker and do not include Carbon Trading.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
 Unless these changes get us to zero emissions targets quicker and do not include Carbon Trading.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Supporting, rewarding, providing information and subsiding all New Zealand industries/companies to make and commit to targets.

These include the farming sector, tourism sector, energy sector and government itself. Encouraging individuals to partake and be
actively involved in behavioural, attitudinal and cultural changes that enable us to reach these targets. Encourage the New Zealand

Media to support all the processes involved in making the required changes instead of ridiculing industries, individuals, local
government/councils and organisations that take or make steps towards the required changes.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
The Climate Change Commission should not just be an advisory committee but have mechanisms built in that hold Government to
account and The Climate Change Commission should be able to make decisions and set policy under its own authority at armâ€™s

length from Government.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Notes
Do not go near NZ ETS at all. This is not the way forward but a way for government and big industry to buy their way out of meeting
it's targets. It does not change the status quo but enables it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3_CYdYDDpk I strongly disagree

with NZ ETS



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

I agree with so many of the points in the Zero Carbon Emissions bill and believe we can take this so much further by being global
forerunners.
