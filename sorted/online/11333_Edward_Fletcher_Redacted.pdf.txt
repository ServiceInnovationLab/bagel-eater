Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Edward Fletcher









Reference no: 11333

Submitter Type:

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 We should reduce opportunities as much possible for system gaming.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No
 Notes



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Otherwise we will keep talking instead fo acting. I already see people delaying and working against and trying to delay the proposal. If
 we don't the first 5 years will be over and we'll still be tallking.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 Budgets should not be changed only the program to achieve them. It's a fail if the target is not met and the next target still needs to

 be met and there needs to be a monitoring system so the Advisory Committee can say that the present settings are not going to
 achieve the aim at any point in the cycle.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
 Notes
 If the consensus is yes then to reduce targets only. Thus achieving an earlier zero state than 2050.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

Time frames should not be to far away though.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Mitigating increased cost of living effects on low income sections of the community. (This is why I favour carbon tax not carbon
trading)




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
There may be a problem if the Commission were captured/controlled by appointees with less than favourable ideas on the purpose

of the scheme and I fear that may be happening with the loading of the commission with views counter to the gaol. (eg the stacking
of the appeal judges of the supremne court in the USA)



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
I don't think either of those situations can hold the Government to account if it is obvious their plans will not meet the targets set
previously. The ETS is a clumsy system and lends itself to gaming.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
There needs to be a mechanism to ensure that the commission cannot be stacked in the way that the (US Supreme Court)

incumbents are able to issue statements that will enble Govt to evade or fail to meet targets.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes
Mixed feelings here, Using the ETS should be sufficient to enable industries./business to adapt to the changed environment.

However with so many of the business leaders now involved I think it will be difficult to now be effective in avoiding subsidizing some
of these changes.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

There is no mention of Grandfathering but some industries need to adapt markedly and go beyond the point of Zero as they were
extremely dirty at the zero set point. These need to be made to change so that they can't just continue to purchase credits forever.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
Make provision but not set it up initially as inovation will come from a diverse approach in a variety of ways. The best ones will emerge

so it would be better if all using the one method from the outset would not be best.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
The ETC will need to produce sufficient income for redistribution to those lower income citizens hurt by the changes being wrought.

We need a better system of support for those in transition between jobs and while this may not be the responsibility of the
commission it needs to be talking to the Support system to enable transition.
