Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Anna D'Arcy






Reference no: 11054


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 There is no way you can omit the methane emissions from Agriculture from the scheme - it would totally discredit the bill



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 we should be brave and go for it



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 In exceptional emergency situations such as new scientific information - but not to be allowed to change or water down as a

 response to economic changes.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 However new Governments could alter or amend the plans to achieve the budgets



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Yes for example an extreme natural disaster



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
A weakness of the UK Climate Change Act, on which the Zero Carbon Act is based, is that the UK Act does not set clear timeframes

for the government to make policy plans to meet future emission budgets (which are set 10-15 years in advance). Carbon Reduction
Group supports the Zero Carbon Act having a strict time frame for setting out policy plans. This should be either 6 or 12 months after
a budget has been set.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Not to be bullied by those with commercially vested interests in being able to continue to pollute and treat the environment as a free
input/output. Please stand firm to Agriculture and Coal



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No
Notes

On balance no, I want the commission to have teeth and be able to stand up to potential future Governments who may not be on
board for carbon reduction, but the flip side is then potentially having unelected people making decisions.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No
Notes

After much thought, on balance NO. I want the bill to concentrate on reduction to zero emissions full stop - and not get side tracked. I
think Regional Councils enacting climate change adaptation plans, as they already are, is the right place for that, however I am not

against reference being made in the bill to Regional and District council adaptation plans - or links being made as it would be natural
and efficient for joint discussions to be made - but no - let the zero carbon bill do exactly what it says on the tin.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
