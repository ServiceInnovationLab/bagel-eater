Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Hamish Laing, Hamish Laing






Reference no: 11582


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 A combination of both answers. The Government should set a target now for net zero emissions by 2050. They should not set the
 more ambiguous target of net zero emissions by the "second half of the century" which could mean 2099. The Climate Change
 Commission should advise on specific targets in the lead up to 2050.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 We need to set ambitious goals to create real change.




 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes

 A combination could be used but its important not to rely on international carbon units as this would mean NZ would miss out on
 opportunities to innovate and improve the sustainability of our economy in the coming age of net zero emissions.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 I believe in flexibility but this should not be at the expense of real attempts to decrease our emissions and create a more sustainable

 economy



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes

 The budget should only be changed within a range as advised by the Climate Change Commission



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Consider their effect on all NZers including Iwi. Te Tiriti should be a major consideration. The Government should also consider
international reputation and that many countries will be looking to ours to see how we achieve our goals.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
No

Notes
This is a separate issue in my view. This particular bill should focus completely on mitigation rather than adaptation




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes
Don't try and do too much with one bill. A separate "Climate Change Adaptation" bill should be proposed.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
Notes

Yes but don't include within this bill.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
This is a incredible opportunity for Parliament to create robust and sustainable climate change legislation which will form the basis for

how we shape New Zealand's economy for the next half century. The implications are important, far-reaching and could set New
Zealand up to be a key international leader as the world looks to move to low/negative emissions economies. The world will be

watching so we need to get this right!
