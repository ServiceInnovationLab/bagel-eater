Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

                (Alina Jane Siegfried)








Reference no: 13006

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 The science is really pretty clear. Even staying within 2 degrees of warming globally will not guarantee irreversible changes in our
 Earth system in a number of different areas, so setting an ambitious target now is absolutely necessary.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 The sooner we start dealing with our methane problem, and steering our economy away from emissions-heavy agricultural practice,

 the better. We don't have the luxury to wait.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 international carbon units only offsets the problem. The reality is that all countries are going to have to be pulling all the levers that
 they possibly can. Only a consolidated global effort is going to save this Earth from catastrophic climate change, therefore we need as

 many simultaneous efforts as possible. I'd also like to strongly suggest that a large proportion of the billion trees project is made up
 with long-lived native species, rather than a short-sighted effort to plant only radiata pine. Carefully managed native forests with
 selective and environmentally sensitive logging practices (as opposed to cut and clear) can provide a new high-value industry for New

 Zealand in the long-term.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Only under extreme circumstances and if new science comes to light suggesting that we have wiggle room. And of course, we
 should always be open to make it a more stringent target to reach if the science suggests that is what is necessary.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Bold targets, set in stone, will help drive innovation towards meeting them which can help our economy transition out of what is easy
and comfortable. It will be a difficult transition for many New Zealanders, but this is the price we pay for decades of relative inaction.

We really don't have a choice anymore.



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
For the most part yes. What I feel is missing from the considerations is consideration of interconnected tipping points at a global level

- one might lump this in with scientific information, but I think it is worth particularly spelling out that no one climate change indicator
can be considered in a vacuum. Consideration of Earth system processes as a whole, working in tandem with each other, is of

paramount importance.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes
If you don't have a plan, there is less impetus to act.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The most important thing to consider is that we, as a global society, are already many years too late to be arguing about the details.

Drastic action is needed on a global scale, right now. The economy will suffer, people will suffer socially, and it the next few decades
will be a really difficult transition period. It's an unfortunate reality that we need to face up to, and is of course a very hard sell, politically

speaking. But anything less than a full commitment towards zero emissions, as soon as we can, is a crime against future generations
and countless natural species.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

Governments of the day will always be bound by party politics, and the fickle nature of voter opinion. An independent climate change
commission should be making these decisions itself.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

These seem like a good set of expert opinions to have at the table. Much like how the Land and Water Forum started out, with all
voices at the table. Unlike the Land and Water Forum though, all recommendations made by the Climate Change Commissioners will

need to followed, and this should be enshrined in policy/law. The Government should absolutely not be allowed to cherry pick which
recommendations they do or don't follow. If a suite of recommendations are made, it should be all or nothing (Hint: It should be all)




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

yes, this is a realistic and pragmatic approach



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
Absolutely, the more we know about the problems and issues we are collectively facing, the better equipped we will all be to tackle

those challenges.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Overall, my view on what we need to do to address climate change, centres around planetary boundaries theories. There are tipping

points in all our natural Earth systems, and we need to stay within them. Essentially, all I want to say is summarised in this 4 minute
spoken word poem performance, of a poem that I wrote summarising the Director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre, Johan
Rockstr√∂m's book, "Big World Small Planet". - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBjB-

w5HD_M&t=0s&list=PLxTt2Nm5dTv3awnK1ren4BtHNctW_v7zY&index=11 MFE are most welcome to use this video to promote
action on climate change. Changing the story - the narrative in our society - is just as important as changing the policy. Bring the

people with you, otherwise we have little hope. For the sake of all future generations, we must act, today.
