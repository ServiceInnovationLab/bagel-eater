Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 3075

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes

 Strongly support new innovations through R&D spend for start ups and foster green investment tools.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 The target should be "No later than 2050". Earlier is better,



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 Moves too slowly.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Modeling should be based on EU standards



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
Goals must factor in accumulation towards 2050. For instance, planting trees for harvest is a nil effect, if those trees are harvested in

2051.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Follow EU protocols, but faster. Investment and R&D spend on startups MUST be part of the picture.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Advisory and monitoring body should be further from Govt control



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes

Emissions trading is not beneficial for the actual goal of mitigation- it is a net detrimental, economic game.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

More aggressively evidence based- this is our children's lives here- less business influence.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Too little, too slow.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
I feel that we need to move MUCH more aggressively on this, the topic of our times and very existence. More action. REAL innovation

spend, not R&D tax credits for our largest corporations. Isuane of green bonds. Acting like this is the crisis that it is.
