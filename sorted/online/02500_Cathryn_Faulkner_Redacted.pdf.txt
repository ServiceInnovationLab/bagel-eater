Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Cathryn Faulkner





Reference no: 2500

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes
 None. Withdraw from Paris as the USA has done.




 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 No reduction needed. CO2 is plant food. We thrive with it. Its pumped into greenhouses to make plants grow. It’s about money and
 getting on that global warming gravy train. The sun dictates climate with solar flares etc.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes
 None needed. CO2 is highly beneficial. Your premise is invalid.




 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Notes

 The country will be living like cave men if you follow this lunacy. People will be dying through an impoverished country with dire
 consequences from this leftie lunacy.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 NZ will be well and truly down the gurgler in 15 years if you continue on this path.




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes

 No emissions budget needed.. Who is coming up with this crap?



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes
 Exceptional circumstances will arrive quickly. It will be A bankrupt country with no electricity, no industry, no new infrastructure, no

 nothing . Appalling, as people are made jobless.



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes

 Off the planet lunacy



 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
 Notes

 Your plans should include the timeframe of never.
Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
Most important issue to meet budgets is to not engage in leftie lunacy which will result in huge deficits for NZ or worse, bankrupt

future generations.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

No do not agree. 30 countries are building 450 new coal powered stations now. 50 countries plan to build 900 in the future. Fossil
fuels provide base load power which ensures we keep warm. The goals are own goals, destroying NZ.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Notes
Dismantle this Commission. Based on a false premise that CO2 is evil. Better get rid of beer, champagne and farting animals all of

which involve products of CO2.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

No expertise is evident. Dopey lemmings using OPM.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
Such a badly worded survey. Climate is always changing and we have been adapting for centuries. We get cold so we warm ourselves.

Cold, we cool ourselves.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Climate change is normal and nothing abnormal has occurred. No need to adapt as all is within normal bounds. Computer models
and the history of the past 30 years have shown how invalid all the doomsday scenarios have been.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
No

Notes
Just more money down the gurgler. Don’t bother. There is no problem.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

What a waste of time and money this survey is. Based n the new religion of global warming, morphing in to climate change when the
warming didn’t happen.
