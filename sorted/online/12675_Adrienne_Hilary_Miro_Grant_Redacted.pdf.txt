Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Adrienne Hilary Miro Grant









Reference no: 12675

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 The target should only be revised in exceptional circumstances. Any changes should be based on solid science or changes to

 international law.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes

 No. Budgets should only be revised in exceptional circumstances.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Under exceptional circumstances, yes. For example, it might be appropriate to change an upcoming budget after an extreme natural

 disaster (such as a major earthquake). Revising a budget in this situation would not mean changing the long-term 2050 target.



 Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes, but I am concerned about the lack of consideration to the intrinsic value of the environment and biodiversity and ecosystem
services. I recommend that there is clear consideration to the intrinsic value of the environment, as well as ecosystem services that it
provides.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

I believe that the Government needs to consider the following: A much stronger focus on education about climate change, its causes
and impacts. Many New Zealanders are concerned about climate change but lack the knowledge and skills to mitigate and adapt.
There needs to be an emphasis on education for mitigation, but also education for adaptation will be important. How ecosystems will

be impacted by climate change and work towards setting carbon budgets that minimise impacts on those systems needs to be
considered. The people in society who are most vulnerable to climate change already, and those who may become vulnerable to

policies and plans set to meet carbon budgets. There is little doubt that behaviour change is required, and this will have social,
cultural and economic ramifications. How just transitions can be put in place to enable these vulnerable groups to succeed in a low

carbon world. The role of Te Tiriti o Waitangi and tangata whenua in determining carbon budgets, using a blend of mātauranga Māori
and other knowledges to find the best solutions.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
However, community engagement and communication must include education both informally, through mechanisms such as local
government as well as across all sectors of formal and further education. It is immoral not to be climate change education to the

younger generations who will inherit the problems to deal with in future. They must be aware and have a say in determining their
future on this crucial issue.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Any adaptation plan must include an element of education across informal and formal sectors.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
