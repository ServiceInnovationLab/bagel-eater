Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Meryl Elizabeth Bacon









Reference no: 8270

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes
 A clear target for 2050 will allow planning and certainty.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 I accept that it will be challenging to reach this goal but as methane and nitrous oxide together account for 50% of our global warming

 emissions (even when counting methane's global warming potential at 28 times that of carbon dioxide), it would be morally wrong to
 not include them in NZ's goal for net zero emissions. I acknowledge that methane is a relatively short lived gas (though it is broken

 down into carbon dioxide) but it's global warming potential is very high - calculated at 120 times that of carbon dioxide at the time of
 emission, 86 times if calculated over a 20 year period and 28 times if calculated over a hundred year period. I acknowledge that the
 level of methane emitted by NZ has not changed since 1990, but reducing in a major way (so that residual methane emission's global

 warming potential could be offset by forestry planting) would help to reduce global warming in the short to medium term.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 Money that would be spent on buying international carbon units would be better spent in New Zealand eg on new forest planting. In
 the past the integrity of international carbon units purchased by NZ has been very doubtful.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 But only by a small margin eg to allow for natural disasters such as volcanic eruptions, or forest fires which would increase our global

 warming emissions.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes

 But with limitations



 Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes
