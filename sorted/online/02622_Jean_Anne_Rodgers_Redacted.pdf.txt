Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Jean Anne Rodgers









Reference no: 2622

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes
 This is way too slow the situation is urgent



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 This needs to include dairy which needs to be replaced with carbon sequestering industries like industrial hemp for building materials

 and as a possible replacement for plastic. Dairy farmers need to be helped to make this transition.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 We should not try to buy our way out of our obligations. As well as planting trees we should stop poisoning wilding pines and use
 them, maybe for biofuel. We should immediatly replant in native trees which once grew in the same places



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Only in the direction of more action sooner



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Although I think these are not ambitious enough.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes

 only in the direction of doing more. Not less.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
Same as above




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes
I think we give too much consideration to financial position. If we are to leave a habitable world for our children we have to make

sacrifices now



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
Plans need to be specific or they will only be hot air




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
We need to change the culture away from consumerism towards a more sustainable and less driven lifestyle. Allow and encourage

more alternative living arrangements such as tiny house villages on Government owned land.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes
Otherwise governments can ignore the experts to further their own aims



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
It will need to as it's definetely going to happen



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

Sharing of information is essential to avoid mistakes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Just to reiterate that our priorities need to change away from selfish consummerism and "jobs now" towards more life affirming ones,

caring for each other and looking after the environment for our children and grandchildren. To this end a universal basic income
would help to achieve equality and free people to do the environmental work that will need to be done.
