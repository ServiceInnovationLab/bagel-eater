Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Michelle A Raill








Reference no: 12360

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 I also think we should support our neighbouring South Pacific countries to lower their emissions, eg Tonga, Rarotonga, Vanuatu etc

 with investment and expert advice and skills.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Only if storms and flooding worsens, so the process can be speeded up.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 I agree that their needs to be emissions budgets, but seriously believe that the next five to ten years are crucial to reduce them

 drastically. I suggest there be budgets set every 2 years in this time, aiming at reducing all greenhouse gases by 50% by firstly
 decreasing the amount of animals in agricultural, and rapidly planting a variety of trees, native forest at hill land tops, more cropping
 trees for farmers to diversify their land use to, eg nuts, fruit etc as well as developing hemp, rice,flax, manuka and wheat crops, so we

 are more self sufficient and less mono intensive crops. At the same time continue increasing Public transport, and offer subsidies to
 low income ind's, students and households. Also invest in inventions to convert current cars to electric, so that the millions of cars on
 the road will not be wasted/trashed. Continue decreasing road freight to rail and open up port trade more for goods to be

 transported around NZ, eg Wellington to Kaikoura and Christchurch, Auckland to Gisborne etc and for exports to leave the local ports
 for overseas. Decrease waste to landfill of organics by teaching and promoting composting for indivdual households, as well as

 setting up regular greenwaste free pickups. Increase recycling by setting up bottle and can deposit schemes for glass, plastic and
 aluminium cans, which also rewards the consumer to recycle. Increasing Planting in cities on skyscrapers vertically, roof gardens, and
 using empty buildings for growing veges and seedlings hydroponically. Important to encourage all households to have own water

 tanks by using recycled plastic to make them cheaply, using grey water for crops and gardens. Promoting dams on farms for irrigation
 use, no more tapping of rivers. Govt and councils encouraging local and community gardens with land, funding and education. The

 Govt and Councils promoting Organic Farming and Horticulture, Banning eco toxic sprays immediately eg Neonicitinoid sprays, that
 harm beneficial insects and fish etc in waterways. Managing Landfills better immediately by investing in filtration of emissions and
 planting out areas surrounding the site in lavender and citronella plants to help deal with bad odours. I think these changes will bring

 about a 50% reduction in emissions in the ten year period, if not more. From then a 5 year emissions budget could be bought in.



 Clause
6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

Position
Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence

Notes
The emissions budgets can only result in less emissions targets, ie reducing the greenhouse gas amounts.



Clause

7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Only to lower the rate of emissions, not increase them.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

Being that in the next 10 years our emissions are lowered by 50% I think should be the focus.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Business plays an important role in reducing emissions, and changing from farming large amounts of animals to a diversified use of
land, preferably in smaller lots, will change our landscape, the debt of farmers, and an investment in completing production of
resources, eg milk to cheese/ice cream not to milk powder for export. Also no more selling of raw timber, only finished products of

planks, furniture etc. Investment needed in Green industry to recycle tetrapaks and all plastics could be funded by Govt and councils.
Increasing information and education to community members via practical workshops on composting and recycling etc held by

Council and by schools, so the message gets to Adults, not just school children. Increase incentives to individuals by bottle deposit
schemes, and offer info in a variety of languages. Encourage change with low interest loans for water tanks, solar power, worm farms

etc available via councils, and for Farmers to successfully diversify with low interest loans from Kiwibank and other NZ banks. Because
we are losing crops already due to flooding and droughts, we need to change how we grow our produce now.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Also Individuals, Businesses and Councils can be subject to fines and convictions for refusing to comply within deadlines, and that
Ecocide becomes a crime. I am annoyed at the amount of farmers and businesses that make no effort to change things that are

beneficial for the environment, and basically have been treated very leniently, had deadlines extended and then still carry on with
polluting the environment etc.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes

For example in adapting to different growing conditions, growers should use tunnel houses. For animals, barns and shade need to be
provided to manage extreme heat and cold conditions. These should be Nationwide standards that local and regional councils

cannot wiggle out of because there are lots of farmers in roles who only care about costs to themselves etc. With housing not just
heat but cooling need to be regulated into Warrant of Fitness conditions. There is a need for large institutions to use their facilities

better, to provide cooling and heating at schools and hospitals, water tanks, roof gardens, and solar power and other renewable
energy sources encouraged.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

I agree with mandatory reporting, we need to inspect that community places and businesses are doing what they are saying. To
encourage uptake by businesses and home owners, rates reductions of 1-5% or tax reductions of 1-5% could be offered as a reward

for compliance and speed in rectifying problems.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

Encourage sharing of information on how to deal with different problems, eg putting houses on stilts, or rocks and plantings on
foreshore to prevent erosion at the coastline etc. Getting rid of coal based fuel usage should be a priority and using wood waste from

pine plantations to make bricks for these boilers, would solve 2 problems at once.



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Because we are in need of rapid change, I think that Research and Development Funding should be available for emissions reduction

projects like converting diesel and petrol cars to electric ones for example. Also encourage more innovation and inventiveness by
offering support and funding for good and great ideas at all levels of society - Home, Business, Transport, Agriculture, Horticulture,

Tourism, in fact you could have competitions for these areas that offer a range of prizes and an easy way to get these
innovations/inventions into everyday life. As I have said previously, it is a priority that we change agriculture in NZ, and deal with
erosion issues to me, and this will also assist in cleaning up our waterways. I do not believe that we should continue in the same way

to run our economy on destroying our environment, and it is time that this was urgently rectified! Thankyou to the Coalition govt that
has asked us for our views on this important issue.
