Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Jenny Easton









Reference no: 2125

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes
 This is urgent and action now will save money in the long term. Certainty will enable industry, planners, LGA etc to start. Unfortunately

 we will have to leave some behind ( pg 8 discn paper) beause the doubters wont agree with the science, and we cant wait.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes
 It would be good if we could separate the fossil methane from biogenic methane for planning reasons, even if its the same in the

 atmosphere. The SLG should be reduced before they are stabilised, and those that are connected to NO2 will have to come down
 anyway. Gas extraction is very leaky and this should be remedied too.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 I have no faith that international carbon units are not fake. There are different ways of counting, corruption etc and I dont think it is
 ethical to pay someone else so we can pollute. Doesnt set a good example.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 But only in really exceptional circumstances, and these would have to be spelt out before hand.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes

 Balance between certainty and flexibility for unforseen cicumstances like change in climate science.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
Yes

Notes
Really exceptional like the next big Wellington earthquake. Droughts, floods, forest fires. and sea level rise are all predictable and

need to be part of adaptation strategy.



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

As soon as possible. It cant be perfect, but we cant wait. Note the gaps and unknowns.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

DOC or Forest & Bird to give nature a voice. The adverse effect of climate change reduces biodiversity. The budgets need to be
spread over a wide range of industries, organisations, Central and Local Govt and seen to be fair and science based.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
I hope the cross party suport will mean the future govts wont derail this. There need to be mechanisms to hold the govt to account.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Public Health is also important in an increasingly warm environment.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
This is also urgent as it will raise awareness in th epublic, stop people building in flood and Sea level prone areas, relocate infra
structure and get discussion going about the sort of trigger values for managed retreat. Essential to provide nationwide guidelines for

LGA.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

Good functions, and please some speed to get this going.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

The advice or legal clarification around LIMs , PIMs is needed . ( NOT Crown Law)
