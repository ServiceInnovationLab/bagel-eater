Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill






Reference no: 12484

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later

 Notes
 There is so much unknown at the moment that may develop and should influence our 2050 target.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived

 gases
 Notes

 This is realistic but stretch target, plus it is supported by science. Although livestock should remain outside any ETS until there is a
 mechanism to reduce them and until our competitors are also including livestock emissions.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes
 Need to ensure that we're not purchasing credits that are actually less efficient than what we're delivering locally. Any money spent

 purchasing credits is money we can't spend locally on reducing our own emissions.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 It must be able to change to take into account events and developments that may influence our ability (positively or negatively) to
 meet the target.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Agree with the areas listed, but need to add food security (global and local). The Paris Agreement requires that food security is not
compromised. Global carbon will not benefit from NZs livestock industry being constrained - it is more efficient than many other

countries who would "fill the gap" if one was created.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Needs to be mindful of developing science in the agriculture space and allow time for that. Penalising farmers financially when they
have no way to mitigate the cost will have adverse effects. And in the energy space - if non-renewables are being phased out, there

needs to be acceptance that that can't happen without additional alternatives eg wind, tide, hydro. The green movement can't have
its cake and eat it too!



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No
Notes

Need some agricultural expertise included - this is the biggest area that can provide an impact or to be affected.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

Have no problem with the functions - but keep them out of this Bill. Broadening the scope reduces the focus on it's core purpose.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes

Concern about legislating this - if there is voluntary involvement, that's fine, but don't create more bureaucracy!
