Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Jennifer Neilson






Reference no: 10523


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 The target needs to be set in law now, being based on the best, most recent, climate science; it needs to ensure we meet our
 international obligations (Paris, 2015 Agreement); and be based on principles of equity. Cross party support is essential. All aspects of
 NZ society and its individuals need to be urged and supported to be pro-active in changing to a low carbon economy in secure and

 fast ways.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 And this needs to happen by 2040 to ensure a limit to global warming of 1.5d C. Total net emissions in our oceans and atmosphere
 so that we avoid ecological tipping points. CO2 at net zero by 2040 and immense and rapid reductions in other emissions, especialyy

 methane



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 The main focus must be on rapidly reducing our GHGs, including those in the aviation and shipping industries. This option is the only
 way to ensure strong environmental safeguards. There should be NO RELIANCE, in any way, on unstable international emissions
 units.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Only to increase climate action




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes

 Altered only if it is to make greater reductions than stated/expected



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Notes
 Only if it means reducing emissions further
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

The science of climate change must at all times be the key consideration - to refer to the ecology of the planet and its systems.
Other considerations include equity, and Te Tiriti o Waitangi obligations



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

Absolutely, if possible within 6 months



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Fairness / equity /health of the people and the planet; allowing for sustainable opportunities & technology relevant to a low carbon
economy; promoting a fair and just society founded on the principles of sustainability social, economic, cultural, environmental) and

thus honouring Te Tiriti o Waitangi. All sectors of society must be included in this vital work



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
It must set NZ's emissions budgets




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes
If it's to be an ETS. And the CCC needs to ensure NZ emits within (and hopefully under) its budget




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
Climate science must always be at the front. Risk management, social impacts, obligations under Te Tiriti o Waitangi are vital




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes

Mitigation is a much, much more important role. The need is also for resilience in the face of uncertainties. I support its role in
adapting to climate change, but bit's a less important role that dealing with mitigation




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
We need a national climate risk assessment and a national policy plan as to how to address those risks. We also need a national
climate adaptation plan. Regular reviews of progress, at least yearly is needed in both areas.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
As do all other people and nations, we need to learn rapidly how to live within the material and energy limits of our planet's

environmental systems. This Bill, if courageous and bold, will improve the well-being of all New Zealanders and the land that supports
us. Systemic changes are needed, and FAST - in our values, our priorities, our economy, ways of life. We need a radical shift away from

exploitation of resources, and growth, towards nurturing the planet & the life it supports. radical shift towards a desire beyond all
others, to support and restore the life and our planet that makes living possible. That way, Papatuanuku and all life she supports, plus

the air around her will thrive.
