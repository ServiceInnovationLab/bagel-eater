Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes
Threat of climate change needs credible mitigation plans and actions to seriously reduce GHG emissions, and achieving the Paris

Agreement’s aim to keeping "global temperature rise well below 2 degrees Celsius” requires moving to zero emissions of carbon
dioxide. The Zero Carbon Bill is that traction and leadership to achieve zero emissions by 2050. The longer we delay our transition to

zero carbon, the more costly it will be. We also miss out on the many benefits and opportunities of early adapting. The world is
changing, rapidly. We need to look at what we are doing to our planet and how we adapt to the future state. The Zero Carbon Act will

help us safely adapt to the effects of New Zealand’s changing climate. It will drive for our rapidly advancing world. Technology and
innovation, changing how we do business and the funding models, optimising resources, collaboration and co-operation, making
smarter decisions will all deliver a resilient low carbon future. A clear and stable path for emissions reduction and adaptation pathways

will help New Zealand businesses and citizens plan for their future and invest with confidence in low-carbon solutions.
