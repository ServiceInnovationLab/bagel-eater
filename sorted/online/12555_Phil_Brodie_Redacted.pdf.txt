Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Phil Brodie, NA (Philip Donald Brodie)










Reference no: 12555


Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later

 Notes
 It appears to me there are serious flaws in the classification of 'emitters', and therefore in the calculation of emissions, and the
 proposed methods for mitigating those emissions.




 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Carbon Dioxide - Reducing net carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2050
 Notes

 A large portion of the 'short-lived' gases are the result of cycling of atmospheric carbon via photosynthesis in plants, that are then
 eaten by animals, some of which is respired back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide and methane.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Notes
 Forestry is a flawed mitigation as sequestration of carbon only occurs up till harvest, or till tree death equates new growth. The ETS is

 also flawed as there is no scientific basis for the current system of treating approx. 90% of carbon lost on harvest, regardless of most
 of the underground carbon being incorporated into the soil biota, and a large portion of the above ground carbon remains in the
 timber and logs that we sell overseas, or are we 'ripping off' the buyers by selling them timber without any carbon in it.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 If the worlds big emitters end up not doing their part our sacrifices and 'leadership' will be futile and our grandchildren will pay a heavy

 price for our stupidity.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 Similar reasons to 4 above.



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes

 If the 'science' that the current 'Climate change' scenario is based on proves to be wrong there will be no escape options, and we'll
 be stuck with the current 'Emperor's New Clothes' situation.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

If future science shows that 'Climate Change' is not going to respond to the targetted carbon reductions, that option is critical.



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
ROBUST SCIENCE ! Which we don't have presently.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

And make sure the ETS is science based, not the bureaucrats contrivance it currently is.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

But how will you ensure there is no bias and predetermination?



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
It is critical as the processes and costs of adaption will better inform emission target implementation decisions.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

The uncertainty I feel over the proposed Carbon Zero policy is further increased when Judy Lawrence,Victoria University Senior
Researcher, recently noted that even if the world stopped all greenhouse gas emissions today, the climate would still change for

centuries.
