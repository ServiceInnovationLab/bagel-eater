Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 9381

Submitter Type:      Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes
 If we fail to commit to net zero emissions at the earliest possible date it is highly likely that the global climate increase will exceed two

 degrees Celsius. As a small island nation this is not a risk we should take lightly.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 "If we fail to commit to net zero emissions at the earliest possible date it is highly likely that the global climate increase will exceed two
 degrees Celsius. As a small island nation this is not a risk we should take lightly." New Zealand is only a small country with a small

 population, yet we have shamefully high greenhouse gas emssions among the smaller nations of the world. It is up to us to be at the
 forefront of global change and to set an example for nations both great and small that change is not only of critical necessity, but that
 it is possible. With some of the highest quality post-secondary training and education across various fields we have huge potential to

 corner the market in sustainable technologies. As the world is running low on non-renewable resources it is not a question of if we
 change our ways, it is when. There is unprecedented opportunity to put our resources into a new market and work at the forefront to
 create the necessary technologies of tomorrow. We now have a choice; to use this unfortunate situation as a boon to our economy

 to enrich our people and offer them a net of security, or to remain laggards due to indecision and let other nations have first pick of
 the crop.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 We need to take responsibility for a government that has allowed both individual businesses and corporate giants to run amok and

 destroy our 'clean and green' reputation. In the name of short term economic gain, we have allowed our rivers to be polluted,
 individuals job security to be de-stabilized, and unsafe work practices to be swept under the rug thanks to insidious corruption in the
 bureaucratic sector. The government needs to do many things. Firstly, it needs to take responsibility for protecting our people and

 our land for the long haul. This means putting down tough environmental legislation to discontinue practices by all those who would
 cut corners in industrial and agricultural business practices in the name of cutting individual costs. We need to have zero tolerance

 for industrial pollution; and for practices that put both employees and surrounding communities in harms way must be ceased by
 having significant legal repercussions. An important change to this could be putting court fines on a sliding scale. If a company or
 individual causes an environmental infraction, it is important for the repercussions to be meaningful. By allowing them to get off with

 only fines in the thousands, you are allowing many hundreds of kilometers of our land to remain at risk. It is important to make a legal
 consequence relevant to the person or group in question; not allowing them to walk out of court with only a sacrifice in small change
 to prevent them doing more harm in the future. You must have severe consequences for every case of contamination, pollution and

 malpractice that appears in court. By charging corporate bodies in the hundreds of thousands, or millions, they would have proper
 incentive to proceed with transparent and honorable business practices. It is also important that those who create destruction are to

 rectify any harm they have caused. By enabling farmers and industrial businesses to clean up their own environmental contamination,
 this will also give them sufficient cause not to do so again. The next change that must be made is creating new employment
 opportunity for those who are currently in communities or fields of employment that will soon be redundant or greatly reduced due to

 climate change adaptation. These are persons such as farmers, miners, fracking well operators, those involved with heavy machine
 industry and those who are reliant on the greenhouse gas vehicle industry. These people must have priority for new jobs; and

 government support until they have and maintain job security. On this note, it is imperative that the government offers support to
 sustainable industry start-ups that have large employee capacity; this could be in sustainable forestry, green industry or in the
 technological sector. It would be a great leap forward for our country if the government could lead by example, providing all

 government employees with a living wage, holiday pay and sick leave. As well as this, if the government was to put funds into re-
 purchasing agricultural land from individuals or businesses, and then creating sustainable forestry operations on said land, it would
 be a clear sign to the peoples of New Zealand that the current government is committed to giving the people a future that is secure

 and promises health and growth. It is additionally important that the government provides support for those who's industries are at
risk of harm due to fluctuating temperatures and extreme weather becoming more commonplace. Industries who rely on consistent

seasonal conditions - such as small-time horticulture farmers and those who operate within the winter tourism industry - need to
have government support in order to exist in stable business practice. It is also important that businesses and corporate practices

that are more sustainable and which reach net zero emissions more quickly and efficiently need to be rewarded. Tax breaks, or more
kosher incentives of the like, would be a huge motivator for people in such sectors. For those who go completely zero emissions

there must be some kind of palpable reward in order to use them as an example to encourage others to follow suit.



Clause
4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

Position
No

Notes
No. It is not acceptable to risk harm to our country and our people by allowing for such a clause to exist. The only time in which this
could be relevant would be if additional measures to more quickly and effectively reduce emissions were to be put in place. We

cannot risk moving any slower than we already are; the risks of harm are too great.



Clause

5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

Position
Yes
Notes

I think this is wise, especially if it means the government has to take clear, defined actions to mitigate and adapt to our changing
climate.




Clause
6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
Position

No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
Notes

As I have said above, no, it is too risky. We cannot afford to slow our journey to net zero emissions at this point in time. The only time
where changing an emissions budget would be appropriate would be to make it more severe, for the sake of protecting our people

of Aotearoa.



Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

Absolutely not. It is too risky, see above.



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

I think the climate change commission needs powers higher than just that of an advisory body



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
Absolutely. It is the role of the government to protect the people; to ensure their wellbeing and prosperity. It is the government's lack
of action in name of "free market rules" that have enabled heavy industry and the agriculture sector to ruin our country's conservation

land, water ways, ocean life and emission footprint. The government must no longer put responsibility onto the backs of individual
citizens; many of whom are ill-equipt to deal with the repercussions of an unchecked increased in climate, let alone have the

resources to change this own footprint The government must legislate to achieve these emissions goals. They must crack down on
unsustainable, high emission practice within our country. By making it tougher for producers to put single-use products onto our

shelves, or to put gas-burning transportation on our streets then this will enable the citizens of New Zealand to easily make the right
choices to support our transition to net zero emissions. This cane easily be done by putting out limits on the amount of plastic and

otherwise un-biodegradable packaging, into our environment. Tough mandates are needed on single use plastic bags, Styrofoam,
uncompostable take-out containers, single-use plastic wrap, wax-lined produce containers, polystyrene packaging containers and
pellets, and plastic microbeads to name a few. If these are no longer available on the shelves of our stores, or needed in construction

and similar industries, then our emissions impact will decrease rapidly and significantly. If the government simultaneously provides
financial incentives for companies who are compliant and who reach net zero emissions more quickly, then this will sit well with the

largely uneducated population of New Zealand. The government also need to put out well-considered legislation on public transit. As
our cities grow more dense and our population steadily expands, we will need affordable, practical, easily-accessible public

transportation. This means action on several fronts. It means ensuring that local body governments are compliant and willing to
create these necessary changes, that funding for transportation is increased to meet these needs, and that we have the workers to
fill these positions. Firstly, we need staff. Which means that the bus/train/boat drivers unions need to be heard, and workers need

guarantee of healthful, safe, secure and reasonable working conditions. This will in turn create many jobs, which will curry favour with
the general public of New Zealand. Secondly, funding. We need to increase our reliance on rail transportation to get cars and buses

of the road, which will ease congestion, improve public health and reduce emissions to boot. We also need funding to increase the
number of 100% electric buses we have on our streets. This will enable service to increase all over the country, which will make

transportation more accessible for a greater percentage of our population, enabling them to leave their private vehicles at home.
Which brings me to my final point on the transport front. We, the people, need public transit that is firstly timely; that runs every five to
twenty minutes over most areas of our major cities. It must be affordable, and we must be able to combine transport types in one

payment, such as the compass system in Vancouver, Canada. It must be accessible to the disabled, those with small children in
prams and cyclists to enable more people to move about with more freedom. Finally, it needs to stretch over a large expanse of both

commercial and residentially zoned land; to enable more people to use it with greater consistency. It will be a large investment on the
government's part. With that in mind, it is important that you frame it as such; something that costs a significant amount of capital up

front, but that pays for itself over generations to come. It is also important to keep in mind that if your citizens are healthier and have
more time to use as they please, then they will be more able and more enthused to create new technologies, businesses and

opportunities for our country to grow as a whole. If you continually frame your actions in the lens of long-term prosperity then you will
be able to garner more public support.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

It is critical that the Climate Change Comission has desicion making powers involving the ETS to avoid what has happened in the past
with those who have higher than advised admissions simply purchasing more carbon units and not changing their actual greenhouse

gas emissions in the slightest. If we continue to use the ETS and set our stock by it, then we must be more disciplined and equally
scrutinize all greenhouse gas emitters.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
The suggested range of expertise is very thorough, I would add that it is imperative that the commission includes those with

expertise on sustainable, high-density urban planning which embodies a city with the spirit of community and human connection



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
Absolutely. Now that it looks as we will miss the 1.5*c threshold, we have a very narrow window to keep the climate below 2*c. With

this increase, it is almost certain that more violent weather and more frequent large weather events will hit our small nation; we must
be prepared so we can best ensure the safety and prosperity of New Zealanders in adverse circumstances. Coastal communities
must have resources to deal with flooding and tsunami risks, inland communities must be well-equipped to deal with flooding,

drought, and high-wind storms.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

make that a maybe. You need to open up more jobs, create new departments specifically for the various facets of climate and use
these to create links between specialists. There are many highly passionnate, qualified New Zealanders who would be interested in

working solely on creating viable, effective climate change adaptation measures for our Nation; you only need to reach out to them
and set this in motion.
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

The government has to take responsibility for reducing greenhouse gas emissions across the board to net zero. It must do this
through: - new legislation to encourage proactivity - funding towards the public transport and environmental sectors - support for at

risk industries - support for those in soon to be reduced industries to find new areas of work and financial stability - sufficient
incentive for innovators to create new and widespread sustainable technologies and business sectors - sufficient incentives for

existing corporate, industrial and agricultural high-emitters to reduce emissions to net zero by 2050 - committing to net zero
emissions by 2050, and protecting this initiative as it is imperative to the survival and long-term wealth and safety of our country -
smart marketing and PR to keep and grow support of the greater public of New Zealand - the creation of a new Ministry for climate

change (or equivalent) to create new roles for experts across numerous related fields to work together on a long term reduction in
emissions (climate change mitigation,) and climate change adaptation which can be put into effect promptly and effectively - the

creation of a climate change commission of diverse experts (equal numbers of male and female, diverse ethnicity, body types and
also inclusive of at least one disabled persons.) - Giving the CCC powers to act, rather than just to advise. The government of New

Zealand must also have more frequent, much better advertised opportunities for submission and advocacy from all members of our
population, as many have missed out this time due to severe lack of outreach.
