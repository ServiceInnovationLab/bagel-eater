Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill










Reference no: 11520

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 As long as the climate change commission is flexible to new scientific data and developments, a firm target is needed, otherwise
 progress and innovation will be slow.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases
 Notes

 We need to efficiently produce food, which is the primary producer of short lived gases. A target that is excessively harsh on primary
 producers will only shift production elsewhere that is less carbon efficiency, harming the businesses of primary producers in NZ,

 making food more expensive for those that can least afford it and leaving the void to be filled by less efficient producers.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes
 We are very efficient producers of food and export over 80% of our produce. As much of our footprint is as a result of providing
 protein to different economies, this needs to be reflected in a trade balance that complements our economic strengths.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 The bill should be flexible for advances in scientific knowledge, monitoring measurements and considerations towards practical

 changes. The commission should hold a biennial consultation process that tracks changes in meeting these targets including any
 new info that comes to hand, with any altering of targets to be consulted on by way of non-binding referenda timed with general

 and/or local elections in a way that minimises partisan influence.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 It is impossible to meet a target without any models of how they will be achieved. A 5-15 year time-frame is sensible for this kind of
 bill.




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes
 It is difficult to generate scientifically based outcomes when constantly used as a political football. Any decision to alter targets should

 be only allowed on agreement and/or recommendation from a climate commission that is established in a manner that is both
accountable and neutral to the government of the day.




Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Notes
Exceptional circumstances need to be clearly defined. Adjustments to the budget would need to made to alleviate suffering, prevent

undue hardship to groups of people who are powerless to change their circumstances or adapt to new scientific knowledge and
developments. Without a definition of "exceptional circumstances" such a question cannot be answered.




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes, these considerations are sound. It is important that in the event of a decision, any disproportionate negative effects on any

particular group must be considered and mitigated in the short to medium term.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes, provided appropriate considerations raised in this consultation process are incorporated.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
1. The Carbon Zero Bill needs to be transitional, not punitive. Society has been built on the basis of many practices, and people

should not be punished for actions that have become embedded due to societal norms. Any practices that need to change to meet
targets need to occur in consultation with affected parties and changes to such practices need to change must be fairly assisted by

government if they are top regulate these changes. 2. Any regulation must be considered with respect to outcomes. If regulations
are made to achieve the outcome of minimised negative climate change, then any regulations that are found to be irrelevant or
counter to this outcome should be removed, and a triennial review process enacted, to be overseen by the climate commission, to

alter or remove out-dated or inappropriate provisions. 3. If revenues are generated as a result of a climate commission or similar, then
such revenues need to be dedicated solely to the remediation of climate change and/or assistance to those that are disadvantaged

by regulation. Revenues are not to be diverted to other government activities and stern oversight should be held over the Climate
Change Commision to ensure that revenues are not spent in a way that could perversely incentivise actions by those in the

commission. 4. Minster Shaw indicated during a public meeting that New Zealand was involved with International alliances to meet
climate change targets. If New Zealand is to be a world leader in climate change action, then we need a tangible voice at this table.
We also need to ensure that any moves made by NZ government are in keeping with and/or recognised by other nations in our trade

agreements.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

These functions need to be decoupled from the political process and needs a process for appointments that removes it from political
gerrymandering. Any appointments to the commission could be ratified by votes from the Vice-Chancellors and/or Deans of

respective schools of NZ universities.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

The ETS needs to be decoupled from the political process. Eventually, any NZ ETS needs to be linked with an international market,
which can only be achieved with international agreements that do not exist at this point.
Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

1. The commission should have a term limit of 2 terms (3-4 year terms) to prevent a culture of feathering ones' own nest and to
encourage refreshment of expertise.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

We are a small nation. As we do not control the actions of others in adapting to climate change, our actions cannot be guaranteed to
affect the outcome. As such, we must be prepared for failure and advice must be sought to protect us against the effects of failure.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes, provided that such functions are applied with the weight of statistical credibility and updated under an independent review
process.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position
Yes

Notes
Yes. These climate change risks need to be publicised as well as the impacts of adapting to climate change and/or the impacts of

preventing these changes. Any information generated as a result of this needs to be carefully handled so that it does not get
misinterpreted.




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Any climate change legislation needs to be considered in terms of genuine human need. Humans need food, shelter, warmth and
community. Many people have become very rich on the idea of environmentalism and many people will be priced out of genuine

human need on the basis of some environmental legislation that has been proposed. As a small country, we will not solve global
issues while impoverishing our own population. Environmentalism is a two way street, and trading one form of crony capitalism for

another will not fix anything. When embarking on any ground-breaking legislation, always remember the law of unintended
consequences.
