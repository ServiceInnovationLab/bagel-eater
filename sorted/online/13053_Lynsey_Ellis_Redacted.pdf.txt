Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Lynsey Ellis








Reference no: 13053

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 Time is running out we need targets yesterday



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 We need targets for all GHG not just CO2



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 Having the option to externalise our tartgets is not in the interest of future generations in NZ



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 We need to set targets and exceed them. They need to be locked in so future governments cant change them for the interest of
 short term financial gain




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 In the event of a disaster the circumstances need to be specific and not open to interpretation of future governments



 Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes but equal resourcing for education and the social sector beyond just fuel poverty we need it also for issues life food and energy
security. There has been a lot of funding in science so far so scientific research if it is focused on supporting solutions. The interestes
of business are important but no more than community and social interests. Addressing issues of equity are also part of the solution.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes

Of course or how will e know if they are working for the next generation?



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Community especially Maori and pacific communities, those already working on the solutions, community development. Education for
al to understand how the issues of everyday behaviour and the big i true of climate change are connected once the public

understand this targets will be easier to achieve, the use of social marketing can play a part here.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

I especially like the adaptation reporting and the joined up approach



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

It has to be more than just an advisory role.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes these areas are good, I especially support the expertise of Maori and the community. You may want to add in health as health is a
tertiary impact of climate change.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes if it is just about what peope cant do then it will not work. This issue is complex and lots of people donâ€™t want to engage as they
see it as too big and hard so adaptation is a good way to sow people how to engage in a positive way.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes this is good a coordinated approach may need to include education around how the areas are connected.
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes
Yes some industries are already doing this eg Wine industry and insurance industry. This has to go buying profits and include

community agencies working with people in food energy and fuel poverty as well.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Thank you for all your work getting the bill to this stage, it is looking great. There is hope for a low carbon future in NZ!
