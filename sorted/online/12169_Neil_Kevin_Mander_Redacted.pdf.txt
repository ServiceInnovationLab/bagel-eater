Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Neil Kevin Mander








Reference no: 12169

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 There is a significant body of scientific opinion which holds that the IPCC approach is onservative in that it does not take adequate
 account of several factors including melting of Antarctic ice. In this case adverse effects of climate change may come faster and

 harder than currently anticipated. Thus, there is a very good case for setting an earlier target date for zero carbon, such as 2040.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 While methane is relatively short-lived in the atmosphere, its greenhouse effect is stronger than carbon dioxide. It is also being
 constantly replenished from multiple sources. It is essential that we include this gas in the plan. This is especially important for New

 Zealand to do.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 It may be tempting to take advantage of purchasing carbon credits from overseas sources. But this source of credtis is already in
 place and it is not leading to the real, overall reduction of carbon emissions. The illustration of shuffling deck chairs on the Titanic, or
 the purchase of papal indulgences has often been used to demonstrate the futility of this idea.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 If in fact the global warming trend is shown to be worse than accepted at the moment, and as believed by many competent

 scientists, then the Bill should allow for the 2050 target to be revised to compensate. This would enable the zero net emission target
 date to be brought forward, and/or lower emissions to be called for at an earlier date.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 This is necessary to enable governments, corporations, commercial organisations and the population at large to plan ahead.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes

 There should be the ability for incoming governments to tighten budgets in order to meet changed situations as outlined in item 4
 above.
Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes, but only under extreme exceptional circumstances, such as the advent of runaway, catastrophic climate change.



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Various NGOs are vitally concerned with the process and objectives. For example, Engineers for Social Responsibility Inc (ESR) has

prepared a set of papers outlining various aspects of climate change and its effects on people and the planet. These Papers can be
found on ESR's website www.esr.org.nz, on the Climate Change Papers page. Government departments, local government bodies, as

well as commercial and corporate organisations will also need to be involved.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
This advice must be made available to the public at large.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
Climate change adaptation should best be covered in separate legislation. The emphasis of this Zero Carbon Bill must be on
achieving zero net carbon. Adaptation to rising sea levels, for example, will require work on low-lying highways such as Auckland's

north-western motorway, and protection or re-location of low-lying suburbs.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes
Some organisations, eg NGOs and Universities, already hold information that could be very useful in this matter.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

New Zealand has a great international reputation as being amongst the leaders in setting up progressive legislation, even when it
might be unpopular in certain demographic areas. New Zealand is widely seen as "punching above its weight" in international circles,

and is respected for that. The Landmine Ban and the Cluster Munition legislation comes to mind as examples. Climate Change
legislation is a matter on which we must be seen as leaders and not as tardy followers. Our present carbon emissions, although small
on a global scale, are big on a population pro-rata basis. It is therefore very appropriate that NZ is seen to be very pro-active in dealing

with the matter. Then, with our own developing expertise, we must be ready to offer assistance to other countries in dealing with
their propblems in their own setting.
