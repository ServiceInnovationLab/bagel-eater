Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Christine Thomson, Christine Thomson Counselling








Reference no: 13023

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 It shouldn't allow for the timeframe for zero emmissions to be extended but if it appears we need to reach target sooner, there
 should be allowance for that



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Notes
 Don't know enough to comment. Need scientists and experts to advise whether this will get us to 2050 target



 Clause

 13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
 Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 It is essential that community engagement and communications are robust. This has been a huge shortfall in climate change publicity

 so far. There is very little available for the average person (especially those not university educated) to know how they can wok out a
 carbon footprint, which lifestyle changes will create the most reduction in their emissions etc. I am well versed in Climate issues and

 it's hard even for myself. International travel is one of the greatest culprits but I know lots of people who travel and have no idea of the
 significance. Equally there are known barriers to people taking action on climate change and these need to be directly addressed
 with input from people with psychological, educational and marketing expertise (sense of despair, effects seem in the future,

 influenced by others who don't appear to be taking action, believing technology will save us, or that it's all up to the government)



 Clause
 14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 I think some consideration should be made but experts should be consulted as to whether this may dilute the efforts toward carbon
zero goal




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

Climate change is called a Wicked problem for a reason. The very thing that we are so reliant on is now the thing that threatens the
wellbeing and even survival of many of earth's citizens. Fossil,fuels are interwoven into the fabric of the economy. The climatic

changes are following the predicted pattern, and this doesn't bode well. Many of the public and businesses are still apathetic.
Legislation is essential. There are growing examples of how this works well in other responsible countries. The equally biggest
challenge as I see it, is educating and inspiring the population toward action, so they are behind this goal in action and word. For 6

years I have voluntarily been hosting panel discussions and documentaries to engage the public on climate change, and there is very
little traction. The action is mostly coming from the small number of already informed people. There are known reasons for this, and

addressing these reasons is ESSENTIAL. It is essential that community engagement and communications are robust. This has been a
huge shortfall in climate change publicity so far. There is very little available for the average person (especially those not university
educated) to know how they can wok out a carbon footprint, which lifestyle changes will create the most reduction in their emissions

etc. I am well versed in Climate issues and it's hard even for myself. International travel is one of the greatest culprits but I know lots of
people who travel and have no idea of the significance. Equally there are known barriers to people taking action on climate change

and these need to be directly addressed with input from people with psychological, educational and marketing expertise . The sense
of despair people experience with the enormity of the issue causes people to switch off. The effects seem distant and aren't yet very
tangible, but sadly it will be too late once they are. People influenced by others who don't appear to be taking action, or they believe

it's all up to the government. They also hope that technology will save us. Research on this is easily available and must be heeded.
Back to Legislation. The Westpac bank recent report concluded that it will never be easy to introduce strategies to reduce carbon

emissions, but more importantly it is easier, and more economical to start now rather than wait. People and businesses, left to their
own devices are known to act slowly over threats of a distant nature. Well considered legislation like a Zero Carbon Act is an essential

first step and lever to ensure New Zealand businesses and families meet their targets for reducing carbon emissions.
