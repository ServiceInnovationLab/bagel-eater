Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Reference no: 628

Submitter Type:

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 I believe vague targets set by successive climate summits around the world is the reason why there hasn't really been anything like
 firm action on reducing the risk of climate change. Fortunately economic factors are increasingly helping things to move in this area

 now, such as the realisation that fossil fuels are becoming more scarce and that green technologies are costing less to produce. We
 need political certainty as well. New Zealand has an opportunity to be a leader in this space. If it sets only a 'goal' it will only succeed in
 being follower in wherever the political winds of the world blow in this issue.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases
 Notes

 I haven't studied this closely, but I assume short term gases are to some extent a part of the normal carbon cycle, so are less critical.
 Whatever target New Zealand sets it has to be economically achievable within the timeframe.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes

 I agree with the idea of using overseas confirmed ETS systems that help prevent deforestation for example. However, there should
 also be a strong focus on offsetting our emissions by new plantings at home. I'm inclined to think that we will have to achieve this by
 allowing more dense residential development within our major cities though and diversifying our economy so that agriculture plays a

 role alongside a wider range of large industries.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Generally I would say it should be revised to an earlier date if at all possible within the limits of our economic ability to do so.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 Revised to a tighter restriction if anything.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

As above.



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Public education is needed because there is still a lot of misinformation about the science. This is where future instability of political

will is likely to come from. This will in turn affect how much to the government budget will be set aside to deal with the issue.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

I will reiterate that I think public eduction is essential to avoid this becoming only a short term policy which a successive government
will simply sweep away or downsize. On the Facebook thread that led me to this submission document nearly everyone who posted

something under the thread were making ridiculous and uninformed comments about climate change science. It is worrying that still
in 2018 there are so many people who think that just because climate change is slow, it must not be real.
