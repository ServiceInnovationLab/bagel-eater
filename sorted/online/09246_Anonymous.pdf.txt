Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill












Reference no: 9246


Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later

 Notes
 As NZ makes .01% of world emissions, while the Govt. may say we can make a difference, we won't make any significant difference at
 all, even if we made no CO2 emissions at all. This is just a "feel good' issue that is making jobs for people that makes no significant

 contribution to the economy of this country. It will be used by some to make money, while not producing anything, but taxing those
 who do.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases
 Notes

 How is what our country emits and uses measured? If grass is not in this equation then this equation is flawed and needs to be
 revised.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 As stated before, this is a scheme that people are going to use to make money, but not by doing anything that will reduce the overall
 problem. Forest planting also has limits and issues as well, see the rubbish that is left behind when trees are felled and where that

 ends up after severe weather.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 For a start the name Zero Carbon is wrong, as what does it mean? No carbon? How do we do that? Or no CO2? Well we would die
 without it.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes
Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Especially the fiscal and competitive considerations any budget targets affect.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

But there has to be sufficient consultation with sectors that will be affected.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

As farming contributes the single most carbon emissions in NZ ( as many other manufacturers have gone overseas, and we produce
very little else) the various farming sectors need to be involved in the process. Research and development are ways NZ could be

world leaders in the climate change issue. We need to ensure enough money is set aside to enable this to happen.



Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

But only if the sectors affected by any budget decisions made, are included in the members of the Climate Change Commission.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
As stated, sectors affected need to have representatives on the Commission. Not just those who are "well respected", but those who
have been voted on to Boards to represent sectors, eg Fed. Farmers, Dairy Board, Fonterra.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No
Notes

I think the task is large enough already, if adaptation is included a different set of skills is probably needed.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Having attended many Regional Council meetings about Emergency Response, the biggest issue facing any Authority trying to deal
with aN emergency is OSH, and the fear people will do something that leaves the Authority having to be held accountable. For
example, sandbagging riverbanks will not be allowed, as it used to be. It won't be a natural disaster that causes the destruction, it will

be that people can no longer do things to protect property that they used to do.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

Yes, although I thought Regional Councils and District Councils already did this. I am not in favour of more committees being set up if
they are only duplicating what is already being done.
