Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Ellen Palmer




Reference no: 10739

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 The target needs to be in law and not able to be weakened, only strengthened. Sucessive governements have pissed around and
 passed the buck on this issue for my entire lifetime. You need to stop that happening and make sure future governments, what ever

 their colour, have to act.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 We have to treat all emissions. We have to act based on the impact emissions have on our planet not on their source. The planet
 doesn't care about the source, only the impact.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas

 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes
 We should do domestic reductions as far as possible and always chose domestic over international but if we have to use international

 then make sure it legitimate.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No
 Notes

 Only revision allowed should be to do it sooner and faster.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes
 only to make reductions to happen faster.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
 Notes
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

I agree that the Government and the Climate Commission should take the following factors into consideration when advising on and
setting budgets: • scientific knowledge regarding climate change • technology relevant to climate change • economic

circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on the economy, as well as the competitiveness of particular sectors of the
economy • fiscal circumstances and the likely impact of the decision on taxation, public spending and public borrowing • social
circumstances and the likely impact of a decision on fuel poverty • energy policy and the likely impact of a decision on energy

supplies and the carbon and energy intensity of the economy.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes
Yes - we must learn from the mistakes of the UK's Climate Change Act and specify a strict time frame for producing a plan.




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable,

and reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi. It must not be gender biased. It must not be baised on technology changes that may
or may not happen.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes - the Commission should not be a decision-making body. However, the Government should be legally required to consider and

formally respond to the Commission’s advice, and to provide an explanation if they do not act on it.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

The Commission should advise the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS. It should not make decisions itself with respect to
the number of units available in the NZ ETS, or its implementation.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
I agree with the following collective expertise: • climate change policy (including emissions trading) • resource economics and
impacts (including social impacts, labour markets and distribution) • te Tiriti o Waitangi, te reo me ona tikanga Māori and Māori

interests • climate and environmental science including mātauranga Māori • experience with addressing adaptation challenges like
planning, insurance and local government • risk management • engineering and/or infrastructure • community engagement and

communications. • business competitiveness • knowledge of the public and private innovation and technology development system.
I think expertise in public health and resiliance is also important.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes
Yes. This may require a separate adaptation sub-committee within the Climate Commission.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
I agree with the proposed functions below, but recognise that nuance is required in terms of how local councils are involved: • a

national climate change risk assessment • a national adaptation plan • regular review of progress towards implementing the national
adaptation plan • an adaptation reporting power



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Act for the children now.
