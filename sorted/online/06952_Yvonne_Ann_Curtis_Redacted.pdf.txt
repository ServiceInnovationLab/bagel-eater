Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Mrs. (Yvonne Ann Curtis)








Reference no: 6952

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 A flexible goal into the second half of the century will mean nothing happens for years. I would want the goal to be moved forward.
 The evidence keeps suggesting that the scientists are being conservative in their time frames.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 Separating out some parts of the community for special treatment when they are powerful and appear to fun the country is a mistake!

 Our short term gases may need to be lessened not stabalized!



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 We need to take responsibility for our emissions. and not buy our way out. We should be selling the carbon units with our
 advantages!



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 But only brought forward...not able to move it later.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed
 Notes
 Won't this mean that an government in power can influence voting by promising to change the budget? It politizes the process which

 should be avoided.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
Again, this politizes the budgets. It means the government can use it to influence voting as we have 3 year terms.




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
I would strongly support a carbon tax...where people who create carbon pay the true cost. Financial indicators are very important.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

Otherwise it will be postponed into the never-never.... the Government must be protected from unpopular decisions.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Maori, City Councils, conservation groups. independent scientists ,



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

We know that regulations that are not monitored are ignored. It is essential that the goals are monitored and made public. Maybe
some consequences if not acheived.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes
I do not trust governments to put in place measures that might impact on powerful groups in the community like the agricultural

sector, or the general population.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes

I think it makes the bill to cumbersome. If this needs to be legislated, it should be separate and be more inclusive of councils etc.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

I am very concerned that anything put in legislation will be too compromised to be effective. Yes it is important to have an all party
agreement, but not at the expense of making a difference.
