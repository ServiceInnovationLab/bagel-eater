Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Anna Murphy





Reference no: 10471

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 Urgent - faster action - we need firm targets, the sooner the better



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes
 Targets must be set for ALL greenhouse gases, absolutely no question about it.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes
 This shows strong leadership - sets a better example. Provides better certainty.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes
 We need to start acting RIGHT NOW. Stop delaying, procrastinating and do what we know works. They should only be revised to

 reduce gases faster than what is proposed.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Yes, sounds ok



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 No matter what happens we need to stick to these targets.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No
 Notes

 Stick to the targets, we dont have a choice.



 Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

We need plans with specific actions - real on the ground measurable practicable actions. Absolutely agree.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

All sectors need to play their part. Just set the targets and people will have to make changes to reach them. Use incentives and
creative solutions. Low interest loans for people to buy electric vehicles etc. Get prisoners planting trees along our riparian margins.

All prisons could have massive nurseries. Teach the inmates about growing trees - probably most of them have had horticultural
experience - hahaha. Get them to grow the trees and then plant them.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Notes
The most important thing is that we see ACTION. Advise and monitor yes, but the Commission needs money to make sure we do
progress towards the goal.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

Yes, plus behaviour change expertise



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes
Definitely- in the Northland region we are seeing regular impacts of the increased flooding and storm events - road closures, slips,

flooding. Coastal erosion. Local government will need all the assistance and direction possible.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
I am so glad that we are moving in the right diection. But its happening so slowly. I want all greenhouse gases Target Zero by 2050,
and I am doing everything I can personally to tajke action in my own life. Please lead by example and get everyone on track.It is

achievable, the solutions are out there, we just have to DO IT!
