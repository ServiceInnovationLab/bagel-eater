Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Jennifer Ward








Reference no: 1193

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Yes but only to reach the target sooner - not to delay.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed

 Notes
 Climate change is too important to be part of a 3-year political cycle. We need enduring commitments. The only changes that should
 be permitted should be those that accelerate our reductions.




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Of course, situations may arise that require a review. However, I would like this to be a narrow range of considerations. For example,
 to simply say alternatives are too costly so let's keep using (old imported) petrol and diesel vehicles would be a total fail.



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes
Without timelines, there is nothing to measure to or track toward.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The current coalition government needs to work hard at capturing the hearts and minds of NZers on this issue. There will be a good

deal of resistance to the necessary changes. Leaders working in all fields to reduce and mitigate climate change need to be
encouraged to speak out and be promoted to encourage others in their sector to follow their lead. This is particularly true for the

agricultural sector. Lots of good people doing good work but overall, a strong reluctance to change or stop externalising climate
change costs. Air travel is the elephant in the climate change room worldwide - and particularly so in NZ where we pride ourselves on
being travellers. Air travel internationally needs to be included in climate change legislation. Personally, I believe that the true and only

future is with our children and young people. If they can be the voice for this change then the job is already halfway done. Maybe this
is where the focus should begin and work out from. (Student army)




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Notes

The NZ ETS seems complex and fraught with the last government investing in known dodgy credits.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Good luck. I support this work and am prepared to make personal changes in order for NZ to step up and be a world leader in this
arena.
