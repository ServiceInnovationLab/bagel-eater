Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Reference no: 2559

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes
 I sense that the model that best allows for continuous updating of targets and procedures has most success potential. Principles of

 the Circular Economy should play a key role using the Ellen MacArthur Foundation as a relevant resource.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes

 This may for all I know, amount to a lower net emissions regime than applied pre-industrial revolution, but given where we've got to, a
 measure of over compensation is probably a good thing.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 Any form of off-setting is inferior to a direct elimination of the issue, but given the likely need for pragmatism to achieve various

 objectives, if any form of off-setting is necessary to achieve them on time, then the best available, rather than arbitrarily domestic only
 options should be utilised.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 No

 Notes
 Assuming question 4 implies revised upwards. Necessity being the mother of invention, an approaching inflexible deadline is more
 likely to spawn productive innovations.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Such budgets should be capable of tweaking if and when it makes sense.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes
 But only in the context of meeting or exceeding targets remaining imperatives.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

As 6 above.



Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Societal behavior change is a critical requirement. Without effective means of moving the consumer society urgently towards

adoption of the principles of the Circular Economy, the process is likely to be going nowhere fast. This involves a comprehensive
range of stakeholders.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

Provided any divergence between the CCC's advice and the government policy is publicly available.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes

Keep it focused on its specific objectives.



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

But I sense that the adaptive process is better dealt with by a dedicated entity.
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

I strongly believe that behavior change is critical to progress towards net carbon zero. Encouragement, advice and implementation
need to be applied as widely, effectively, and as soon as possible.
