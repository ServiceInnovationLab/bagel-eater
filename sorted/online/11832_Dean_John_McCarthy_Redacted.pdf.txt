Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

       Dean John McCarthy









Reference no: 11832

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes

 does not set a target for a proxy for pollution but focuses on actually reducing pollution and enhancing living environments



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 Carbon Dioxide is not effective as it misses to many more important factors and ignores social factors. ie chases the wrong car in the
 save the planet argument.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 it should ignore them. it should educate and research more efficient use of resources and increased life spans for exisitng capital
 plant. it should encourage increased personal responsibility for efficient use of resources, this proposed enforced/tax/punishment
 approach suits the NIMBY portion of the population and panders to social consciences rather than actually doing anything.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Notes

 Chase the car that improves the environment. Carbon is a bad proxy. search more efficient use of resources, be more productive with
 what we have. wrong track!



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Notes

 No tax is not the answer to this problem. Education is. CO 2 is not a valid measure for pollution. isnt that the actual problem? Climates
 change. Fact! CO2 was intended to be used as a proxy for pollution and is not that good at it. the rest..ie man made climate change is
 irrelevant probably and at best a side show to the actual issue, tiding up our activities, feeding the population, protecting the

 biodiversity in the most efficient maner.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Notes
 Emissions targets of CO2 are not useful or relevent to improving our or any environment. thay are a bad proxy for damage as they
 focus on the wrong things for the wrong reasons. More efficient use of resurces. longer life cycles of capital. better adherance to

 best practices. reduction on waste. increase in reuse/recycle all good, CO2 tax does nothing for any of that.



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
 Notes



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

No
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
Focus on the actual problem of the environment. CO2 emissions are a poor proxy for pollution and result in bad practices. Appeasing

NIMBYs is not a good reason to make bad decisions



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

This whole approach chases the wrong car.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes

Climate. hange is not the issue. pollution is



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Notes

focus on pollution CO2 emmision is only one proxy avaiable for measurement and is now not viable or trusted because of lack of trust
in the administration motives




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

No
Notes




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No
