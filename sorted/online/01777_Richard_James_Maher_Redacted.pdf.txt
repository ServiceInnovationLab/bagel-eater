Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Richard James Maher









Reference no: 1777

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes

 The Climate Change Commission should be tasked with further analysis and disclosure of: 1. Cause and effect of emissions in a
 technical sense; 2. Provision of a range of options for the way forward; 3. Full disclosure of economic costs and benefits of each
 option; and 4. Recommended option which should then be submitted to a binding public referendum.




 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 None of these are appropriate without further analysis of the effects on New Zealand and it's place in the international context.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Notes
 To discuss 'how' is premature, given the paucity of information disclosure.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 Again budget setting should follow the democratic agreement of the way forward. If any busget is set it should be restricted to the

 cost of providing the necessary analysis and information dissemination to allow an informed debate and subsequent referendum..



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes

 Each in-coming Government should be able to review the way forward at any point and not be retsricted to only the third budget as
 suggested. This will be appropriate as more and better information becomes progressively avaialble.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Notes
 See notes under q.6 above



 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

On the proviso that the definition of a 'sustainable economy' covers correctly weighted triple bottom line outputs.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Democratically agreed plans on the way forward should precede budgets. Broad public discussion surrounding a binding referendum
would generate the considerations and issues to be taken into account.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No

Notes
If any I favour option two on page 42 - Advisory, with mechanisms built in to hold Government to account. Similar to the UK.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
If any role is given to the Commission then I favour the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environmentâ€™s suggestioin - that the

Commission provides advice prior to any change a Government might seek to make to ETS settings.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
However business competitiveness expertise should be essential as knowledge and experience in this area will be required to

contribute to risk management, engineering and community engagement.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes
Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
I believe that this propsed Bill is premature and should be preceded by rigourous information disclosure of cause and effect and

cost/benefit. Public debate should be sought to determine a course of action for NZ, (a sovereign nation) preferably by way of a
binding referendum.
