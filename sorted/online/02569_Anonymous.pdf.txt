Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill








Reference no: 2569


Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Notes

 There is no real scientific proof that carbon dioxide ( man made or nature made) causes any significant global warming. What is
 scientifically proven is that CO2 levels have been proven to increase AFTER significant changes to the global temperature. This is

 because the oceans are by far the greatest reservoir of CO2 and as is well proven, the CO2 holding capacity of water is reduced as
 temperature increases. The presumption in this discussion document is unscientific ab initio, and as such, is not valid for any
 purpose other than propaganda purposes. The climate has always changed and will continue to do so in a manner that mankind

 cannot materially influence, other than by catastrophic nuclear war waged across the world. The consensus argument bandied about
 is a complete nonsense. And it is sad today that scientists who do not "buy into" the politically driven consensus risk their careers
 and funding. In my opinion, this disqualifies the so-called scientific consensus. Fortunately, in New Zealand, we still have freedom of

 expression, a fundamental right and historically, questioning so-called consensuses in science has led to many corrections and
 scientific breakthroughs, all of which have benefited mankind.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Notes

 as per 1



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Notes

 as per 1



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 per 1 As countries realize that CO2 has no significant bearing on normal climate change, and as the costs of implementing expensive
 measures escalate in vain attempts to chase targets which achieve absolutely nothing of significance, the economic and political

 reality will ensure that this wasteful expenditure will cease and used for real economic and social upliftment projects. In a recent
 discussion on SkyTv Australia, it was revealed that no cost-benefit analysis had been done, and that in fact, Australia could shut down
 it's entire economy and the ultimate effect would not be detectable at any statistically significant number in the climate change

 forecast models.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position
 No

 Notes
 Per 1



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes
 Any incoming democratically elected government should have full rights to dismantle any prior legislation imposed. To deny this is to

 deny the very essence of democracy.



 Clause
7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

per 1 plus, because as the political consensus realizes that there is no validity in the presumption that CO2 causes global
temperatures to increase in any significant manner, they must be able to change and/or abolish the futility and expense for no return.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No
Notes

The climate change commission is not a democratically elected body and has no scientific standing other than that conveyed upon
them by a political consensus, not a valid scientific authority as their premise is wrong.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
No
Notes

per 1



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

A democratically elected Government should at all stages ensure it is listening to the people's concerns in a transparent systematic
manner, even if the people's position is at odds with political aspirations of incumbent government.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

With the caveat that the Climate Change Commissioners appointments must reflect equal numbers of scientific experts comprising
climate alarmists and those who do not agree that man-made CO2 is a significant driver of natural climate change to ensure that real

science is always present in any decision making which has economic ramifications.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
No

Notes
Natural climate change over a long period of time will have ramifications that should be properly evaluated by alarmist scientists and

non-alarmist scientists. Sea level increases can be properly evaluated without the political and fraudulent science spin as exemplified
by some quasi-scientists regarding sea level increases for some Pacific Islands, whereas they fully know that these particular Pacific
islands are sinking into the sea due to numerous well-documented reasons. Natural increases in sea level rise are well accepted and

are significant in certain topographical regions over relatively short-term periods ( 20-40 years ), and in other areas over much longer
time periods. There are well -documented reports of stable sea levels in many parts of the world, and instead of studying these to

gain further real scientific knowledge, they are deliberately ignored by alarmist scientists. The fact that the earth's oceans are 1.332
Billion cubic kilometers in volume, and the vast majority of this volume below 1000m depth is really stable at around 2 degrees

Celcius is never acknowledged by warmists. The average depth of our oceans is 3682 metres deep. 70 % of the earth's surface is
covered by the oceans, and the extremely unscientific "sampling" of temperature points on land is deeply flawed across a number of

scientific principles.
Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

per 1 ; alarmist science has no standing, and there should be a transparent referendum before any of these radical economic steps
are taken, with full disclosure of cost-benefit outcomes, including economic scenaria.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
No

Notes
No, this pre-supposes that CO2 is a significant driver of natural climate change, which it is not.



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

I would like to see the New Zealand Government's open recognition that the world's climate has always changed, and that there is
still no verifiable scientific proof that mankind has an ability to influence the normal climate change patterns to any significance. The

climate has changed significantly in the geologically recent past, without mankind's inputs. Hence in the absence of scientifically
verifiable proof that mankind can affect the earth's climate, spending trillions of Dollars to attain something which is fraught with
uncertainty and many vested interest groups without a public referendum is premature. There are numerous examples of deliberate

scientific fraud perpetrated to alarm ordinary citizens about climate change, for instance by alarmist proponents like Mr Al Gore. There
is far too much alarmism which in many cases is driven by funding models that many scientists have come to rely on to pursue their

interests. True science is never settled ( https://www.wsj.com/articles/climate-science-is-not-settled-1411143565 ), and the vitriol by
many of these alarmist scientists, such as the recently convicted fraudster Michael Mann of infamous hockey stick fraud, and Al

Gore's "you can do this at home" fraud clearly show that real science is being stifled and denied. Name calling by alarmists does
nothing to further true science, and labels like "climate denier" is a reflection of an inability to grasp the inconvenient reality that no
scientist has ever claimed the climate doesn't change. Climate has always changed, and will continue to do so driven by elements

completely out of the control of mankind. To name a few : The sun, the earth's orbital changes, volcanoes under the sea and above
the sea, and catastrophic events like significant sized meteorite impacts. None of these can be influenced by any spending by any

government. Instead of wasting trillions of Dollars on chasing ghosts, there ought to be a focus on expenditure which benefits
mankind in significant areas such as health, food production, poverty alleviation, and peace.
