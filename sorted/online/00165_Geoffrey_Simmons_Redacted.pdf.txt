Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Geoffrey Simmons









Reference no: 165

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived

 gases
 Notes
 Methane is different and needs to be treated differently in terms of targets (or change the measurement method to acknowledge the

 difference between a stock and flow).



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 If the target is right then international carbon units shouldn't be needed by 2050 - maybe for the 2030 target though.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 But the justifiable reasons to change the target should be set out and the process for doing so. E.g. if the science changes or
 international agreements change considerably. Cost and economics is no reason to change a long term target.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes
 Changes could be permitted as per the above - changes in the scientific understanding or international agreements. However, if

 these changes are not consistent with a pathway to the 2050 target they must show the impact on future budgets and a plan for
 getting back on track, akin to the Fiscal Responsibility Act (see comment below)



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
Notes

Changes could be permitted as per the above - changes in the scientific understanding or international agreements. A large scale
natural disaster may also push back timeframes, however this cannot be an excuse for doing nothing - after all doing nothing will lead

to more natural disasters. However, if these changes are not consistent with the 2050 target they must show the impact on future
budgets. This is somewhat akin to the Fiscal Responsibility Act. The Govt has a job to deliver (budget surpluses with the FRA, the

2050 target with Zero Carbon Bill) and when circumstances don't allow it to achieve that job, it has to set out a path to doing the job
again.



Clause

8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No
Notes

This is a good list but should also include scenario planning. Given the long term nature of these plans and interdependency with
international players the CCC should develop a set of scenarios and run the budgets through them.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes
Government should look broadly at co-benefits (e.g. health benefits of public and active transport and insulation) and co-costs (e.g.

planting trees in dry areas may not be a great idea) of policy actions in setting the plan. Equity impacts are also important. Buy in from
MSD, MOH, MOT and Regional Councils is needed at a senior level.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards

its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes
I think the CCC is worthy of slightly more power. Their budgets and ETS settings should be the default starting point for any

Government. If a Government decides to do something else, it not only has to explain why, but if the plan proposes less action, it
must set out a plan of how to get the nation back on track to the 2050 target - akin to the Fiscal Responsibility Act.



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS

Notes
As per the above I think the CCC makes the decision, but the Govt has the power to overrule if it deems necessary and can still show

how it will achieve the 2050 target.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes
I would add: - scenario planning/ futures thinking/ systems thinking - some understanding of the major areas of possible co-cost and

co-benefits of climate policy. To me this includes equity impacts, public health and transport.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes
Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
The risk of adaptation (as we see clearly around the country) is that such systems tend to cater to the squeaky wheel (rich locals)

rather than true need. EG Wellington spending billions building sea walls while Haumoana slips into the sea. This natural tendency of
the public needs to be counterbalanced somehow, which will take some work on the social side. It is essential that Govt responses

clearly differ in regards to 1. vulnerability - e.g. whether someone loses their primary house or beach house and 2. effectiveness - e.g.
whether to build sea walls that will protect an area for a few decades and destroy beaches in the process.




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
