Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

same, John Michael Amos






Reference no: 12955


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes

 If the target is ZERO emissions, then let's legislate this now and hold ourselves to it.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived
 gases

 Notes
 However, because of the very powerful lobbies associated with methane and nitrous emissions in NZ. option 2 must be real.



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 But let's be wary of wholesale pinus forest planting- triffids is an apt description.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 But with a parliamentary vote requiring two thirds majority.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes

 Nervous about this - 'He giveth and he taketh away'. The UK's 'Zero Carbon in 10 years' is a classic example. How can trust be
 generated that this time , it's serious and the Government will resist the inevitable pressure to 'water down'.



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes
 But also carrying a two thirds majority parliamentary vote clause.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Define exceptional circumstances? Given past performance from Government(s) - lots of air, very little substance, we need an

 Environmental Constitution, with two third parliamentary majority to amend.
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Notes
Faint heart never won fair lady, appears you are readying yet another 'cop out;.




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes
Notes

How else could we possibly reach target?!



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

As wide a consensus as possible, if we don't all want to accomplish this, it will not happen.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

But who will play policeman ? Who will oversee that commitments and regulations are adhered to?



Clause

12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?
Notes

Both advise then receive Government mandate and support in allocating ETS.



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

As long as we don't create a ' camel is a horse designed by a committee'.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
Yes

Notes
This is perhaps where we should encourage NZ's genius for adaptation. The potential economic benefits from world wide interest in

our creative flexibility are enormous.



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?
Notes

I'm not sure there is much value to this, I think even the most hardened sceptics now accept Climate Change is real and threatening.
But a 'Forum' on encouraging and disseminating local actions and participation(s) - 'let's all be part of the Grand Journey to

sustainability'.
