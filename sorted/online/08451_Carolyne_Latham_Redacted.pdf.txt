Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Carolyne Latham





Reference no: 8451

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission

 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Carbon Dioxide - Reducing net carbon dioxide emissions to zero by 2050

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)

 Notes
 The ETS and carbon unit system seems to me to have been dreamed up by some financial wizard in order to make money. This
 should not be the foundation of a country making an honest attempt to address its emissions.



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Notes
 Why would it be tied to a change of Government? It shouldn't be political but should be based on facts, how we are progressing, what

 is needed to reach the third budget and the effect on the country of doing so. These things should drive any amendments to the
 budgets, not an incoming government. Therefore review periods should be set.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 Yes
Notes




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Notes
Depends how flexible it is. We don't want to be locked into a suicide mission.



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Notes
The practicalities, cost and impact on those affected, of actioning any plans.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Notes

The ETS is flawed and has resulted in the opposite of what was intended. It was set up for financial gain and this should not be the
motivation for addressing greenhouse gases. There should be honest accounting with every person and industry dealing with their
own effects. An ETS shouldn't be required to achieve this.




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes
There also needs to be practical knowledge of the most affected industries. Not industry representation as such, but people around

the table who can relate discussions to the actual practicalities.



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position
No

Notes
Adapting to climate change is a whole other kettle of fish.




Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position
No

Notes
Deal with it separately because it will be happening at a different pace than emissions, and no-one knows what that pace is going to

be.



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes

Deal with it separately. TA's in the first instance need to be working consistently on the effects of climate change and the issues are
similar around the country so government needs to show leadership.
Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
To me it seems that to date the accounting system, including the ETS, has been broken. Emissions in a biological cycle should not

be included. Forestry is not the fix all that government seems to think, it has many negative effects as well. If the accounting is done
properly I suspect that NZ's emissions in the world scheme of things are miniscule. There is alot of other pollution here that should

be dealt to, look at all the garbage that stores like The Warehouse, and the other "cheap crap" stores which are popping up
everywhere are bringing into the country all of which will ultimately end up in the landfill. Why don't you do something about that? And

reducing packaging - the gains that we make by bringing our re-usable bags to the supermarket are all lost by the likes of Pams
putting half a dozen tomatoes in a plastic container. And when you buy something the size of a matchbox on line, and it comes in a
whole lot of packaging? Why don't you do something about that? I think we will be buried in our own rubbish long before we run out of

oxygen or get frazzled by the sun.
