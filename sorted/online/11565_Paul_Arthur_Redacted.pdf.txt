Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Paul Arthur













Reference no: 11565

Submitter Type:    Individual


 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 Act local, Think Global. Cheap Carbon Credits have given us a decade of deforestation, uncertainty, and avoidance. Planning to
 purchase carbon units from overseas suggests we are planning to avoid changes. NZ can benefit from selling international carbon

 units. Do NOT purchase overseas credits.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 No
 Notes

 Circumstances will always change. Parliament can always change the Zero Carbon Bill regardless of this "position" question achieving
 Zero Carbon earlier than 2050 will not require the Zero Carbon Bill target to be changed.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 no proposed "borrowing" from future budgets




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position

 No
Notes

"exceptional circumstances" always exist eg "Natural Disaster" arising from Climate Change? Dont Change the target - solve the
problem.




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes - your Page44 comments appear to undervalue the cost to NZ of missing our international committements. Being a "net polluter"

will devalue NZ inc. Budget setting must include the positive benefits to NZ, environmental leadership, and a strong Brand NZ.



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

NZ Business, in particular Agriculture sector MUST be on board. Clear pricing signals to help long term planning - eg "Kiwirail main
trunk de-electrification/carbonisation" Strong committment to mitigate delaying tactics from Carbon exploitative industries. Champion

companies and individuals, celebrate those who have achieved the goals. with respect to sea-level rise and climate change effects as
part of the ZCBill :- Figure out how to stop insurance industry from contracting out of obligations due to CCC formal risk assessments.
Figure out how to maintain at-risk land and structures as productive. Local Government NZ harmonisation with Zero Carbon Bill risk

assessment and adaption plan Changes to Resource Management Act , Local Government Act, Environment Acts etc as required.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes
Notes

In addition challenge Science NZ to be ACTIVE in measuring NZ and Overseas emissions. Ensure the reduction gains are real or
Challenge the Science and process.




Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme
(NZ ETS)?

Position
Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS

Notes
CCC must be covered by OIA processes and report transparently to NZ NZ Government to implement or justify deviation




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Commissioners to publish their individual Carbon Footprint (eg 5 trips to Zurich, or saved due to skype)



Clause

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Yes
Notes

Risk Assessment, and adaptation plan. Climate Change Commissioners to get local government working together



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

Ability to REWARD$$ high performing individuals, companies, councils with say small% of CO2-e saved, subject to verification/peer-
review and national publicity...



Clause

16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes
Notes




Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
NZ to be THE Global leader. Zero net 2050 requires a change - Business as usual will result in more junk ukrainian credits or the next

version of that, and Kiwirail Diesel quality planning processes. I do not purchase US products due to their position on the Paris
Accord. NZ cant afford to be a global polluter. Zero Net 2050 must also include planning for a) Science now says 2050 is too
conservative 2040? 2030? and HOW TO IMPLEMENT if required. b) climate change refugee's and displacement - internal and from the

low countries. Thank you for your efforts.
