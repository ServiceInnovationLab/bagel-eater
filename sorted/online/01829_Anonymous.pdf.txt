Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill







Reference no: 1829

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes
 Focus on the meat and diary industries - 49% of greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture, according to the Ministry for the

 Environment (April 2018). I would like to see New Zealanders encouraged to reduce the amount of meat and dairy they consume,
 which would also improve general health. Farmers could be encouraged to diversify and focus more on sustainable, plant-based
 protein sources. Young farmers could be encouraged/incentivized to go into horticulture rather than agriculture.




 Clause
 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
