Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Ben Mansfield










Reference no: 33


Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 Although net zero emission will be incredibly difficult given the large methane emission of farming, it is essential to our viability as a

 country to be amibitious and aim high.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 International carbon units fail to take domestic accountability and the system is prone to fraud.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Yes, but safeguards need to be in place to ensure the target revisions are due to credible reasons, not an ambiguous change in
 government perception. I am worried a change in government could derail the entire purpose of the law.



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set
 Notes
 Yes the third budget should be able to be revised after budgeting as to allow business to plan and account for changes and to

 enable greater transparency



 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under

 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say
 Position
 No

 Notes
Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
With special attention to the Treaty




Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position

Yes
Notes

Absolutely.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

In particular the faming sectors which accounts for over half our GHG emissions need to be consulted to work out a pathway that will
work for them while reducing our ecological harm.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes

I believe the comission needs to advise government but having some binding presence in their reports - otherwise the power of this
law could be easily negated by a change in govt



Clause

13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
And I agree sector experts are needed to be on the comittee, perhaps hearing from panels of stakeholder groups as needed (but
who would not be a part of the committee.




Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes
Yes, as an island nation we need a plan for the climate change that is coming.
Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

More shared knowledge = better



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Althought this bill has a lot of promise, I believe it imperative that we put safeguards in place to stop a change in government or

progress to reverse the power it has. Also - the ETS is broken, why keep it?
