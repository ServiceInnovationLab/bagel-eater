Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Xavier Serrallach









Reference no: 9095

Submitter Type:     Individual

 Clause

 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?
 Position

 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now
 Notes
 We cannot delay on achieving net zero emissions till the second half the century.



 Clause

 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes
 Whilst the likes of methane is in the environment for a much shorter period of time it's impact on the environment is much greater

 therefore we need to work on zero emissions by 2050 and zero impact on the environment. I actually believe we should aim for
 below zero carbon emissions by 2050 if it is achievable so that we have a positive impact on the environment. I'm thinking what more

 we can do globally.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)
 Notes

 We need to be able to standalone on this and not pass the buck to other countries. We should encourage other countries to look at
 doing the same.



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 Yes but only if we can do better than our target of zero carbon emissions. We need to be ambitious because the future of the world
 depends on it.




 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Notes
 Sorry but I do not understand the question that is being asked so I cannot answer



 Clause

 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position
 Yes - the third emissions budget should be able to be changed but only when the subsequent budget is set

 Notes
 I say yes reluctantly as I would very much like for this country to meet the targets set. I think what is important is that we have all

 parties on the same wavelength and working together so that any transition or change of government does not affect the plans that
 are already in place. This should have the involvement of all parties at all times so that a new government does not come into power
 and is clueless to the plans on achieving zero emissions by 2050.



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes
Yes but only under exceptional circumstances as stated in the question. We should always being heading in the right direction i.e.

always reducing our emissions even if we are slightly behind the target. In such circumstances I would hope that it is not a significant
adjustment. If the adjustment is considered significant then there should be a full review as to why we have fallen behind in our
targets.




Clause
8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account

when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say
Position
Yes

Notes
I agree that all the considerations mentioned on page 44 to be relevant. If there are found to be considerations missing then they

should be added immediately.



Clause

9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?
Position
Yes

Notes
I imagine the Climate Change Commission will advise the government of the timeframe it has and that it will provide support and

expertise on setting out these plans.



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

I do not have anything to add here that has not already been mentioned on page 44.



Clause

11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
Position

No
Notes

It should do more than advise and monitor. It should also be part of the decision making.



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Makes decisions itself in respect of the number of units available in the NZ ETS
Notes

In the past the National government has failed in its duty to implement good policy and practice in regards to NZ ETS.



Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes

The UK Committee model sounds good. As stated our Commission should have similar credibility and transparency.



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
Absolutely yes!!! Currently the world is reacting instead of adapting.
Clause
15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say
Position

Yes
Notes




Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their
exposure to climate change risks?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?

Notes
Having good measurement tools and models is important so that we have accurate data to respond to and have confidence in our

plan. Thank you for allowing me to submit my thoughts.
