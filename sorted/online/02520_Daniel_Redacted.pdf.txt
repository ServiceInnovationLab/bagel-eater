Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Daniel




Reference no: 2520

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission
 advises on the specific target for the Government to set later

 Notes
 Climate Change Commission to include substantial representation of business & industry stakeholders, given the share of

 employment these sectors make up. Also a voluntary scheme to achieve the goals, rather than target. Evidence is that the US, on a
 'goal based system' is already seeing carbon levels dropping faster than projected.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Notes
 Prefer no target as this will add significant costs to business & industry, and thereby the rest of the country. Jeopardises NZ ability to

 be competitive from a productivity rate as well as cost efficiencies, both of which NZ cannot influence globally.



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Notes
 Voluntary basis by using goals



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes

 Notes
 If the NZ productivity and economic activity slows down to the point whereby employment suffers.



 Clause
 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any

 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?
 Notes

 Yes to tree planting. No to the Commission



 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?

 Position
 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes



 Clause

 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position

 Notes




 Clause
 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
 when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No
 Notes

Position

Notes



Clause

10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?
Position

Notes



Clause

functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
No
Notes




Clause

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

No
Notes



Clause

Do you have any other comments you'd like to make?
Notes

I am concerned that NZ will become unaffordable for New Zealanders as energy, transport, and other sectors will see costs go up.
Then employment will suffer due to the manufacturing and production areas of our economy, especially agriculture, will see their
costs go up as well. Retail is not a economic activity that signals the health of the economy. Hoping and suggesting that technology

innovation will compensate for other emissions heavy sectors cost increases is difficult to see for NZ. Rather let market forces
determine that outcome.
