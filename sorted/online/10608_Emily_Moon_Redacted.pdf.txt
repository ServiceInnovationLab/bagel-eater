Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Emily Moon








Reference no: 10608

Submitter Type:    Individual

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes
 2050 is still very late. Legislation is a more certain way to ensure action on such an urgent matter.



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?

 Position
 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050

 Notes



 Clause
 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?

 Position
 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards

 Notes



 Clause
 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes

 Only if the target get moved to an earlier date. By no means can it be moved later.



 Clause
 9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we
 need to work with, what else needs to be considered?

 Notes
 Making companies who produce environmentally unsustainable goods (i.e. heavily wrapped in plastic) accountable for the damage
 their goods create later in their lives. Taxation on these companies, or making them contribute to the solution.

 its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say
