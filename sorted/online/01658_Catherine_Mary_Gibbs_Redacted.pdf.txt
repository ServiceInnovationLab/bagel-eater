Your submission to Zero Carbon Bill

Catherine Mary Gibbs








Reference no: 1658

Submitter Type:

 Clause
 1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?

 Position
 The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now

 Notes



 Clause
 2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?
 Position

 Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050
 Notes



 Clause

 3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?
 Position

 Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas
 (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards
 Notes



 Clause

 4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?
 Position

 Yes
 Notes
 Could be earlier than 2050 target. e.g. 2040 could be reached given how urgent our transition needs to be. Be bold!



 Clause

 5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any
 given time. Do you agree with this proposal?

 Position
 Yes
 Notes




 Clause
 6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?
 Position

 Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence
 Notes
 Especially if the need to reduce emissions is even more compelling than it is at present.




 Clause
 7. Should the Government have the ability to review and adjust the second emissions budget within a specific range under
 exceptional circumstances? See p36 Our Climate Your Say

 Position
 No

 Notes
 Different government interpretations of "exceptional circumstances" is too vague. We cannot possibly consider any watering down to
 reach zero carbon.



 Clause

 8. Do you agree with the considerations we propose that the Government and the Climate Change Commission take into account
when advising on and setting budgets? See p44 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we

need to work with, what else needs to be considered?
Notes

Address the challenges of our vulnerable communities. We cannot rob from the poor if we want a just society. Create incentives to
support low emission alternatives in housing, transport, land use. Government must address the common good of each and all.




Clause
11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards
its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme

(NZ ETS)?
Position

Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS
Notes




Clause
13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise.
Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
14. Do you think the Zero Carbon Bill should cover adapting to climate change?

Position
Yes

Notes
Everything is connected so of course adaptation, mitigation and reduction to reach zero emissions work together. A good example is

planting more trees. We adapt land use to limit agriculture and increase forestry; We plant trees to mitigate the increase in carbon; By
planting more fast growing trees we move closer to zero carbon targets.



Clause

15. The Government has proposed a number of new functions to help us adapt to climate change. Do you agree with the proposed
functions? See p47 Our Climate Your Say

Position
Yes

Notes



Clause
16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their

exposure to climate change risks?
Position

Yes
Notes

Anything that encourages organisations working more closely together to achieve this goal should happen. We need to think
holistically and not in silos or with fragmented efforts. This is as encompassing as the air we all breathe and the clean water we all
need to survive. A collective effort is needed even though we might not agree on everything. It's the big picture that's at stake here.
