      "notes": "I am a retired farmer from Cambridge. I wish to make a submission to the Our Climate, Your Say consultation on the Zero Carbo bill. As\n\na farmer, and like my fellow farmers, I have had a lifetime interest in climate and its changes. It had, and has, a major influence on my\noccupation and the profitability of our enterprise. My interest in the subject of climate and climate change intensified from the period\n\nwhere it was indicated that agriculture was responsible for 48% of the GHG emissions in New Zealand. How so, and why? I started my\nresearch by contacting a scientist who was present and involved in the Kyoto negotiations, Richard Christie, Executive Director of the\n\nSouth Island Dairying Development Centre. As a farmer, I was frustrated by the fact that under IPCC rules, no mitigating factors are\nconsidered in the protocols New Zealand agreed to at Kyoto. The difficulty was, according to Richard Christie, that it would have been\ndifficult to establish those protocols, particularly in relation to New Zealand agriculture, in the negotiations. Richard’s final comment in\n\nhis email to me was the telling one – “Those negotiations seem to have much more to do with politics thant (sic) they do with saving\nthe planet”. I was to later challenge Prof Jacqui Rowarth of Waikato University at a public meeting as she spoke of the need for\n\nagriculture to prepare to meet commitments in GHG reductions. I later discussed the issue at length with Jacqui. To my amazement I\ndiscovered that Jacqui had no knowledge of the actual proportions of the atmosphere carbon dioxide and methane represented, nor\n\nwas she aware of these gases being measured and recorded here in New Zealand since 1960, nor carbon dioxide’s minute annual\nincrements (see table below). In New Zealand atmospheric gases are monitored and measured by our Ministry of the Environment at\nBaring Head, in Wellington. When I advised Jacqui that carbon dioxide was 0.043% of the atmosphere, a mere trace gas, and vital for\n\nthe survival of life as we know it on this planet, in astonishment Jacqui exclaimed – “OMG!” I was stunned by Jacqui’s reaction. In\ndisbelief she asked me if what I said was true. I advised Jacqui to check the information out herself. She later did. I still wonder how\n\nmany of the advocates for reductions in carbon dioxide know this fact. To clarify – that is one four hundred and thirtieth of one percent\nof the atmosphere! Halve that amount of carbon dioxide to 0.02%, and all life as we know it will cease to exist. Photosynthesis stops\n\nat this level! Carbon dioxide, a trace gas, is the building block of life as we know it, our environment, our food, our oxygen. It is\nessential to life. Despite what some would promote, our atmosphere is not awash with this gas. It is measured and monitored. 1850\n\n1960 2012 Co2 ATMOSPHERIC PERCENTAGE 0.0425% 0.0360% 0.0430% WORLDWIDE MOTOR VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS Nil\n126,888,000 1,114,558,000 ATMOSPHERIC CO2 INCREMENT ANNUALLY 1.5-1.6 ppm/Yr 1.5-1.6 ppm/Yr The interesting observation of\nthe tabled data – factual and recorded - is that there appears to be very little relationship with the combustion engine and the actual\n\natmospheric content of carbon dioxide. There was a drop indicated in the 1960 figure which could corelate to the quiet industrial\nperiod of 15 years following World War Two, suggesting minute increments as a result of human activity. In preparation to put my\n\nsubmission into writing I emailed the advertised email address on the Consultation website with the following request on the 25th\nJune: “Could someone on the Climate Change Team please supply me with a reference, or references, to the specific and conclusive\n\npeer reviewed research that directly attributes and clearly demonstrates scientifically, that atmospheric carbon dioxide, and the\nreduction of this gas from its present level at approximately 0.043% of the atmosphere will directly and conclusively change the\nworld’s climate to the exclusion of all other potential causes. I would also be interested to know, to what level should this gas be\n\nreduced to satisfy a “Zero Carbon” policy.” Being advised after a follow up that the matter was being worked on, I was eventually\ndirected to an IPCC 5th Assessment Report and told “This report represents the global scientific consensus on climate change,\n\nwhich the New Zealand Government accepts.” Simply, the Climate Change Consultation team were unable to specifically answer my\nrequest, not that I fully expected the team to be able to provide that answer or answers. So why would a government accept that\n\nassessment? How much research has it carried out? I then elected to contact the secretariat of IPCC in Geneva and made the same\nrequest. Mxolisi Shongwe of the IPCC Sectretariat finally responded. Again, I was presented with two website links outlining the\n\nAssessment report 5, Chapter 10 wherein I was promised I would find my answer. I was faced with a raft of modelling and\nassessments in a report spanning. The reports did not answer the specific information I requested. I was confronted with an\nelaborate raft of IPCC assessments all of which in some form or another endeavour to “fingerprint” changes in temperature and link\n\nthem to GHG’s. The most common term used by all the authors was ‘likely’ or ‘most likely’. Much, if not all of the data published was\neither presumptions or forced modelling. There was no established and demonstrated fact showing clear and proven links that the\n\nminiscule actual and measured increment of a trace gas, carbon dioxide, in any way, was capable of being a major cause of climate\nchange. Analysing the actual data in the table above, and assuming the consensus of contributors to the IPCC case was that the\n\nincrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide was the source of global climate change, this would actually mean that from 1960 when the\nabove records were made by the Ministry of the Environment to the 2012 level and beyond, a span of 52 years and beyond – an\nincrease of atmospheric carbon dioxide by 16.28% of one four hundred and thirtieth of 1% of this trace gas is causing global climate\n\nchange. Little wonder that the IPCC secretariat was unable to answer my question! So where from here? Nowhere in the official IPCC\nliterature did I find any mention of, or reference to, a known and significant natural cause of climate change., the Milankovitch orbital\n\nvariations. Following study, the National Research Council of the US National Academy of Sciences has embraced the Milankovitch\nCycle Model ...orbital variations remain the most thoroughly examined mechanism of climatic change on time scales of tens of\n\nthousands of years and are by far the clearest case of a direct effect of changing insolation on the lower atmosphere of Earth\n(National Research Council, 1982). Orbital variations of the planet, ie. changes in orbital eccentricity affect the earth-sun distance.\n\nCurrently, a difference of only 3% (5 million kilometres) exists between closest approach (perihelion), which occurs on or about 3\nJanuary, and furthest departure (aphelion), which occurs on or about 4 July . The other is variation in Axial Obliquity. The change in the\ntilt of the earth’s axis (obliquity) effects the magnitude of seasonal change. At higher tilts the seasons are more extreme, and at lower\n\ntilts they are milder. The current tilt according to NASA is 23.5 degrees nearing its highest tilt. We are currently observing apparently\ngreater extremes in climate which would be consistent with the above known facts In summary • There is no such thing as normal\n\nwhen we consider climate. • A change in climate – which, forever changes - is to be expected. That we, living on a planet hurtling\nthrough space at 36,000 mph, and expect it to fly a precise orbit is nonsense. • The world is growing in population, we live in a time\n\nof instant communication and graphic video of what is occurring. If I had had a modern cell phone in the 1950’s I could have recorded\nflooding on our own property that has never occurred since. The result of that flood instigated the Waikato River Flood protection\nscheme, dissipating these events in a managed way. My video from one particular “cloud burst” would have flashed across the world\n\nlike what we see occasionally today. It was spectacular. As our communities and population grow, worldwide and here, there are\nplaces that just should not exist as and where they are. For example, Edgecumbe in the Bay of Plenty will flood again. It is built\n\nalongside a river with a huge catchment on a flood plain. Whanganui is similar. The world is embarking on change such as electric\nvehicles and the management of the environment and resources. That is good. Our resources are finite. To believe that Carbon\nDioxide is the cause of climate change, simply beggars belief when one considers fact rather than hypothetical modelling. I\n\nunderstand the difficulty of having to meet obligations previously entered, however I would rather see New Zealand take a measured\nand thoroughly critiqued approach to “the scientific consensus” of the IPCC Assessment Reports which show its authors and\ncontributors qualitative level of confidence from very low (more predominantly) to very high (seldom). As Richard Christie said, “This\n\nhas much more to do with politics than they do with saving the planet” Therefore, I pose my question directly to the Climate Change\nPublic consultancy and to the Government which accepts this “scientific” consensus, and that is simply: Either the Government or\n\nthe Climate Change Team please supply me (and the New Zealand public) with a reference, or references, to the specific and\nconclusive peer reviewed research that directly attributes and clearly demonstrates scientifically, that atmospheric carbon dioxide,\nand the reduction of this gas from its present level at approximately 0.043% of the atmosphere will directly and conclusively change\n\nthe world’s climate to the exclusion of all other potential causes. I expect, and demand a specific, conclusive answer that would justify\nthe economic cost of current solutions that are being promoted. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this directly with the\n\ncommission if it were possible.\n\n\n\n You have elected to withhold your personal details from publication."
