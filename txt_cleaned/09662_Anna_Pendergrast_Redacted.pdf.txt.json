      "answer": "The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now",
      "answer_index": 0,
      "notes": "There should be some legislative requirements for government to demonstrate it is actively working toward this target, even if the\n target itself isn't enforceable."

      "question": "3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?",
      "question_index": 2,
      "answer": "Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards",
      "answer_index": 2,
      "notes": "NZ should reach its targets first by reducing emissions domestically, then by offsetting carbon emissions domestically (including\n\n planting forest), then by purchasing domestic carbon credits, and only then (if not achievable by other means) by purchasing\n international carbon credits. There needs to be a real change in high-emissions industries to make this happen."

      "answer": "No",

      "notes": "No - all changes to reduce the target should have to go through the legislative process."

      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "The term \"innovation\" is noted a lot as a necessity for being able to meet the targets. This is too vague and needs defining, especially\nif you're thinking about things like geoengineering, as the public needs to be able to provide input on major proposals. As a zero net\n\nemmissions plan is expected to result in a slower increase in household incomes, concerted effort should be made to implement\nprogressive taxation and to mitigate economic burden on lower income households & communities. The burden should fall on\n\nwealthy companies and high income people who have benefited most from the high-carbon economy. Money should be set aside for\njob retraining and culture change counseling for those likely to lose their traditional livelihoods due to the necessary ramp down of\nsome more polluting industries."
