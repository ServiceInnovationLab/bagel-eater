      "question": "1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?",
      "question_index": 0,
      "answer": "The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission advises on the specific target for the Government to set later",
      "answer_index": 11,
      "notes": "Meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement requires net zero emissions by the time global temperatures reach \"well below 2C\" and\n potentially as low as 1.5C. When this will occur remains unknown, but it may be as soon as mid-century. The Government may wish to\n\n consider building flexibility into the Act to allow the date of net zero to be adjusted as the climate response emerges, although clarity\n regarding the temperature goal (e.g. net zero emissions by the time global temperatures reach 1.5C above pre-industrial, defined as\n the average 1850-1900) would be helpful."

      "question": "2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?",
      "question_index": 1,
      "answer": "Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived gases",
      "answer_index": 12,
      "notes": "See our submission: Submission_ZCA_Allen.pdf: reducing the contribution of New Zealand's emissions to the increase in global\n average surface temperature to zero requires net zero emissions of long-lived gases including carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, and\n\n gradually declining (at approximately 0.4% per year) emissions of the short-lived gas methane. This is equivalent to net zero\n emissions across all gases if aggregated using the science-based GWP* metric."

      "question_index": 3,
      "answer": "Yes",
      "answer_index": 3,
      "notes": "An explicit mention of global temperature in the Act would address the possibility that warming may occur faster, or slower, than\n\n current estimates suggest: the ultimate goal of the Act is to limit New Zealand's contribution to warming, not warming by any\n particular date. Allowing the timing of net zero to adjust to the emerging temperature response would address this issue, although it\n\n would be helpful for planning to make clear that net zero emissions will still be required at some point, likely early in the second half of\n this century if the more ambitious interpretation of the Paris long-term temperature goal is adopted."
