      "notes": "The concept outline below suggests constructive ideas as to how and why carbon is far more important than just climate change -\n\nand ways to achieve that. ShelterForest: - A solution for some of the most critical challenges facing mankind in the 21st century:\nSignificant elements: - Climate change, costs, consequences, and carbon implications; ShelterForest outlined; Global topsoil\n\ndegeneration and implications; Opportunities from trees and shelter; Ramial chipped wood - an answer to sequestration and soil\ndegeneration; Hydraulic redistribution – a previously unrecognised quality of many trees; The imperative to include shelter in carbon\n\ncalculations; Introduction: Our planet is in the process of exceeding its capacity to support the rampantly expanding human\npopulation and the demands from increasing consumerism. Major challenges include climate change, loss of topsoil, and,\nincreasingly challenged water resources, - factors all addressed by ShelterForest. Climate change currently has a significant political\n\nprofile. Calculations suggest the current annual global cost of climate change at US$140 billion although, given global climatic events\nduring Aug/Sept 2017, this figure might be dramatically understated. Financial, economic and loss of life costs can be expected to\n\nincrease exponentially in line with recent trends. The most immediate response to global warming is to reduce levels of atmospheric\nCO2. The pragmatic way of achieving this is by the planting of trees. Unfortunately, planting forests also conflicts with increasing\n\ndemands for food – or do they? ShelterForest (SF) accommodates this conflict by proposing planting large numbers of trees in ways\nwhich increase land productivity, reduce the impact of climate change, and provide additional opportunities and benefits. The\nconcept: ShelterForest proposes planting of 20% of all land in trees in the form of shelter belts of some 20 metre or so width. Shelter\n\nbelts thus become belts of forest rather than single lines of trees by growing several rows (say 3) of harvestable lumber trees inter-\nplanted with understory plants, all chosen for multiple purposes and functions, including rotational harvest. The shelter value of the\n\nplantings alone will more than compensate for the land taken out of production in most, if not all, situations. These benefits will be\neven more significant with the advent of increasingly extreme weather predicted by global warming. While a primary objective of\n\nShelterForest is to combat the causes and consequences of climate change, the most immediate benefit will be in the economic\nvalue of shelter will begin within months of being planted and grow rapidly thereafter. Growing trees sequester carbon, both through\n\ntheir own biomass and into the surrounding soils, thus contributing to soil regeneration. In addition, there are other benefit\nopportunities with profound implications including environmental, economic and sustainability. ShelterForest design process: SF is\nachieved through a design process considering a complex range of factors, possibilities, and outputs. All farmland should be\n\nincluded, especially productive flats and ‘easy’ land. The starting point for each site would be an in-depth analysis of relevant factors\nincluding geology, geography, prevailing winds, sun orientation, climate, existing structures including established trees, waterways\n\netc. Plant selection would consider plant functions, characteristics, their relationship with each other and the environment as well as\nresource, harvest, and other considerations. Such might include the use of deciduous trees to enable sun penetration during winter\n\nand early spring months whilst retaining significant shelter function. Understory shrubs would provide livestock protection against\nadverse weather during winter. The Value of Shelter: The economic benefits of shelter are all too often little recognised. A passage\nwas noted in an American journal a number of years ago which suggested: - If you plant 20% of your land in trees, productivity on the\n\nremaining 80% will increase by 80%. This was more recently reinforced by the reported experience at Windwhistle – a name inspired\nby environmental circumstances - in Canterbury, NZ - where it was observed that when shelter was planted “productivity increased\n\nby more than 60%”. These observations suggest that the productivity value of shelter alone in most situations will provide gains well\nin excess of any perceived loss of production from the area planted in trees. Shelter is an essential part of many permanent crops. It\nseems likely that for most, if not all other farming activities, the economic value of shelter is little understood and/or has not been fully\n\nevaluated. The mechanics of shelter: The immediate value of shelter is reduced wind. Within the zone immediately behind shelter,\nwind speed is reduced by about 80%. At a distance 10 times the vertical height of the shelter, wind speed will be reduced in the\n\norder of 30% to 50%. Thus, shelter of height 30m will have significant downwind benefits for more than 300m, coincidentally also\nbenefiting the next ShelterForest belt. Reduced wind means reduced stress on both animals and plants and reduced loss of water\n\nfrom evaporation. Wind-chill increases the energy (food) requirement of livestock and can have particularly devastating, even fatal\nconsequences, particularly when accompanied by cold rain. Heat can also be a source of stress which can be accentuated by direct\nsun and by high temperature winds (the other end of the wind-chill factor). Skin temperatures on dark animals have been measured\n\nupwards of 50oC. Trees beyond shelter: Trees have been critical to the development of life on planet Earth. They have been integral\nto the development of man since he began using fire and making tools. Today they are still essential for many building structures and\n\nindustries and provide a huge biomass resource which is also a natural alternative to many fossil resource requirements, Many trees\nhave extraordinary value as livestock fodder - nutrition and health from leaves, twigs, bark, and fruits, - food for bees (an increasingly\n\nthreatened element of reliable food supply), food and environmental support for wildlife and natural predators etc. They are essential\nfor erosion control on steep hills and along river banks. A significant aspect of SF is that, through the design process, mature trees\ncan be harvested on a rotational basis with minimal impact on the functional integrity of the shelter. Slash from harvested trees can\n\nbe an energy or alternative biomass resource, and/or, chipped as a resource for regenerating topsoil (see RCW below). Many leaves,\nand even the bark from some trees are highly nutritious and naturally sought after by livestock. The harvest and by-products from SF\n\nwill provide new economic and sustainability opportunities for the land and its owners as well as increased opportunities for\nmeaningful employment. Carbon sequestration: Estimates suggest that about 30% of the current excess carbon in the atmosphere\n\noriginated from degrading soils. Trees naturally sequester carbon. Climate change is a serious challenge and but soil degeneration\nmay be an even more critical. We need to return carbon to the soil for the regeneration of organic biomass and soil fertility. As soon as\n\ntrees begin to grow they accumulate carbon from the atmosphere, both below and above ground. It has now been shown that\ncarbon levels in the ground increase as you get closer to trees, likely through natural leaf and twig litter and other biological\nprocesses. Most of the world’s fertile topsoils were formed by natural forest litter. Satellite technology can now measure every\n\nsignificant tree canopy on the planet. It is particularly important that these are all recognised as every ton of C is relevant, especially if\nwe (the tax payer) are paying for carbon credit deficits. Every tree contributes to carbon sequestration and long-term sustainability.\n\nThe soil resource (or deficit): The soils of the world are being degraded at an alarming rate with loss of soil biomass (carbon) a major\nfactor. University of Sydney Professor John Crawford says that current projections of topsoil degradation suggest that within the next\n\n50 years our planet will produce 30% less food with a population demanding 50% more. This equates to a projected food deficit in\nthe order of 50%. Trees, particularly in the form of ShelterForest, provide an extraordinary answer to this dilemma, in part through the\npotential of Ramial Chipped Wood: Ramial Chipped Wood (RCW): < http://forestgeomat.for.ulaval.ca/brf > Research began at Laval\n\nUniversity, Quebec, in the late 1970s as a result of large piles of slash left after logging operations. Over 20 years of research\nproduced positive, if not astounding, results with two in particular illustrating the potential; strawberries in Quebec and tomatoes in\n\nSenegal producing yield increases of 300% and 1000% respectively. Fertile topsoil is a critical ingredient for high yielding crops.\nThroughout evolution plants and trees have been essential to the formation of topsoil. We now have the understanding and the\n\ntechnology to dramatically enhance this natural process and begin to repair the damage done by global deforestation and modern\nfarming practices. Perhaps the greatest opportunity from RCW is to sequester carbon into soil in a process which could have\n\nprofound implications for the lives of billions of people within the next generation or so. Mobile technology is already available which\ncan chip trees at up to 90 tons/hr - the limiting factor being access to raw tree material. This equates to 180,000 tonnes every year\nfor each chipping unit. With SF, such material would be grown and processed on site eliminating most transportation and further\n\nprocessing costs. Another opportunity arising from this concept is that lower grade RCW+, (RCW is defined as having a diameter less\nthan 7cm) could be chipped by the same equipment, either as a bulk resource (such as energy) or as an expanded resource of\n\nwoodchip for sequestration. RCW offers a process which enables recovery from the massive global deforestation over recent history\nand subsequent soil degeneration by providing organic material to regenerate topsoils and enhance land productivity. Composting is\n\nlong considered a fundamental of good gardening. (It is the natural process of forest litter.) RCW expands that concept to a new level\nof practicable possibility. The place for trees today is as an integral part of all conventional farming rather than, or as well as,\nconventional forestry. Water: In addition to reduced evaporation resulting from shelter, increased biomass in soils will further benefit\n\nwater challenges by increasing the water absorption and retention. This should be of special interest in the light of anticipated\nincreasing weather extremes from global warming. Organic soil matter can hold 20 times its own weight in water. Hydraulic\n\nRedistribution: This is an extraordinary quality recognised in a report from UC Berkeley in 2005. Upwards of 60 tree species were\nrecognised as ‘dumping’ water at the bottom of their roots at wet times and releasing it back into surface soils during dry times. This\n\nhas the benefit of alleviating stress on the plants during both flood and drought. Back to the future: Mention the concept of planted\nforests and the immediate thought is of large areas of single specie trees. This continues the modern experiment of mono-culture\n\nwhich clearly challenges our planet’s natural evolutionary biology. SF invites a revisit of the concept of ‘forest’ and consideration\ntowards more natural integrated biological systems. These will prove to be more productive, much more sustainable and less risky\nthan the intensive monocultural farming methods which currently prevail. ShelterForest will, at planting, begin the many and complex\n\ncontributions to a more viable and sustainable future, contributions which will grow year by year. Marcus Williams"
