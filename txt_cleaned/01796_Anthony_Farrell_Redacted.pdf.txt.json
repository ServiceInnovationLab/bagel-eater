Although the proposed bill is yet\n to be drafted it is obvious to all New Zealanders what form it will take. The bill if enacted will be the most damaging legislation to be\n seen in New Zealand for all of our non military history."

      "notes": "The proposed bill is based on the premise that the science is settled and there need be no further scientific discussion to justify it.\nThat view is not held by many thousands of New Zealanders who have very valid scientific qualifications, who are well educated in\n\natmospheric physics and climate change matters and who have been monitoring the political dialogue on this issue for many years.\nThe minister has included statements on weather events in the introduction to the MfE conversation document regarding historical\n\nclimate change that are demonstrably incorrect. When questioned he declines to enter into any discussion on these statements. Let\nme make it very clear, 'The science is not settled'. The economic impact on New Zealanders of this draconian legislation will be\n\nimmense, potentially destroying the livelihood of New Zealanders living in already damaged areas due to the political ideology of a\nvery small proportion of the population. The government does not have a mandate to force this legislation on the country. It must not\nbe allowed to proceed without a comprehensive explanation of the scientific evidence and economic impact and a binding\n\nreferendum agreeing to support it. A very large number of New Zealanders will not agree that this bill in any form be introduced to\nParliament and submitted for passage into law. The bill must not proceed."
