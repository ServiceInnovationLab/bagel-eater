Fonterra has signalled willingness to comply and for example to switch from coal fired milk\n powder driers to using wood waste but is stalling on the implementation date. They need to be pushed. There need to be national\n\n and regional targets and coordination with local government especially at a regional level. This is practical as much as policy but\n unless there is a realistic blueprint for action and National and Regional Policy Statements and teeth to enforce it, this won't happen.\n\n You say \"The Government is committed to this. Incorporating te ao Māori (the Māori world view) and kaitiakitanga (the concept of\n guardianship) in our approach, as well as working with industry across the agriculture, forestry, energy, transport and waste sectors,\n will help to get the transition right. \" This needs to be expanded to include a specific local government dimension as they have\n\n knowledge and capacity but lack clear guidance."

      "answer": null,
      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "Three main sectors for targets are transport, industry including electricity generation, and agriculture. Main co-partners in transport\nand infrastructure are local authorities who have many responsibilities but lack clear direction. Infrastructure, transport and\n\ndevelopment planning currently lacks a requirement to consider climate impacts in approving work. There is the option under the\nResource Management Act to issue National and Regional Policy Statements but this is underused. The Climate Commission should\n\ndevelop guidance, possibly for regulation, on how to assess development proposals for long term costs both in how they would\ncontribute to problems eg Wellington Airport Runway extension adding to climate issues, and in responding to climate related issues\nlike sea level rise and coastal erosion eg Shelly Bay development including new coastal roads likely to be prone to storm damage.\n\nWith regard to Land Transport issues, here are points I made to the Productivity Commission| Overall I support the proposed\napproach which could have significant impacts for New Zealanders. Seeing what happens next will give us insights into whether the\n\nGovernment will follow the Transport Strategy with other changes in response to environmental and economic challenges facing us.\nIn this respect my thinking is influenced by the recent Productivity Commission Report on getting to a Low-emissions economy, and\n\nrecent columns by Rod Oram such as this. 1 General Land Transport Transport infrastructure and modes of transport are needed to\nget people and goods to where they need to go. Effective transport options enables communities, individuals and businesses to be\n\nconnected and thrive. Failure in networks and services can be catastrophic for those relying on them. 2 Public Transport I strongly\nsupport the focus on public transport. Key elements to public services are affordability, reliability and convenience. People who are\nolder, or younger, or with families, or are disabled, rely on public transport more than those with other options. Their needs should be\n\nprioritised in planning changes and provision to services. Someone who is blind or vision impaired or in a wheelchair may travel short\ndistances under their own power but for distance travel most will rely on public transport. In some cases this will include taxi services\n\nbut these are limited. Uber has regularly refused to transport disabled passengers. I strongly support the shift in funding away from\nnew roads towards safer roads and more public transport and more infrastructure. 3 Cycling and Walking I strongly support the shift in\n\nfunding to provide more infrastructure for cycling and walking and would welcome a policy focus, especially at local government level,\non removing barriers that prevent people from cycling or walking. Enabling people to bring the bicycle on a bus or train would let more\npeople use them, especially when train stations or bus stops are not within easy walking distance of a commuter's home. 4 Health As\n\nwell as reducing air pollution, a shift from using fossil fueled vehicles to other modes of transport will have additional benefits\nespecially for public and individual health. These include reduction in diseases associated with a sedentary lifestyle, greater\n\npsychological wellbeing from contact with others in the community and from being mobile and getting fresh air and gaining outdoors\nexposure including better vitamin D levels from sunshine, fewer road traffic accidents and affordable access to transport. The cost of\n\nhealth services could be reduced if transport related causes such as respiratory ailments from air pollution were reduced, as well as\nfitness improvements reducing needs in cardiovascular and sedentary lifestyle ailments. If health co-benefits and co-harms of\n\ntransport proposals were factored into cost-benefit analyses, the result could see more investment in active and public transport,\nand less investment in private motor vehicle oriented transport. A greater focus on safety and reducing road traffic accidents should\nresult from a mode shift from cars to public transport and walking. 5 Disability and Accessibility Issues People who are older, or\n\nyounger, or with families, or are disabled, rely on public transport more than those with other options. Their needs should be\nprioritised in planning changes and provision to services. Someone who is blind or vision impaired or in a wheelchair may travel short\n\ndistances under their own power but for distance travel most will rely on public transport. In some cases this will include taxi services\nbut these are limited. Uber has regularly refused to transport disabled passengers. Public transport, and clear reliable\n\ncommunications about services, are essential for many individuals whether travelling to work, study or on personal matters. Anyone\nwho becomes disabled through accident may not until that time realise how dependent they are. 6 Climate Action New Zealand's\nwork on meeting its climate obligations will benefit from increased use of electric powered vehicles, public transport and walking and\n\ncycling. These reduce greenhouse gas emissions from individual fossil fuel powered car use. Transition towards electric vehicle use\nand away from fossil fueled vehicles will also help raise awareness of issues and commitment. 7 International Obligations New\n\nZealand's work on meeting its climate obligations will benefit from increased use of electric powered vehicles, public transport and\nwalking and cycling. These reduce greenhouse gas emissions from individual fossil fuel powered car use. New Zealand also has a\n\nresponsibility to act to support the health of its citizens. Improvements to public and active transport services should be part of this\nplan. 8 International Reputation New Zealand relies on its \"Clean Green\" image for marketing our country as a tourism destination and\nfor the sale of our agricultural products. Every visitor who shares stories exposing gaps in the reality and every media story criticising\n\nour record can do our reputation harm. This can also impact on the prices we can charge for these products and activities. 9\nEconomy and Productivity I support the overall direction taken by the Productivity Commission's draft report on transitioning to a low-\n\nemissions economy, including the plan to encourage the replacement of vehicles powered by combustion of fossil fuels with\nelectricity where feasible. This should include buses. As the Commission says, to help the private sector and civil society plan and\n\ntake long-term decisions a stable and credible policy environment is needed. The Government must signal a strong commitment to\nthe transition, and be clear about its policy intent. This includes a stable and credible climate policy underpinned by:  getting\n\nemissions pricing right, to send the right signals to motivate investment in low emission technologies and processes;  harnessing\nthe full potential of innovation and supporting investment in low-emissions activities and technologies;  creating laws and\ninstitutions that endure over time and act as a commitment device for future Governments; and  ensuring other supportive\n\nregulations and policies are in place (including to encourage an inclusive transition). A long-term and quantified GHG mitigation target\nshould be set in law, to clearly signal the direction of travel. Underneath this all-gases target, separate additional mitigation targets\n\nshould distinguish between short- and long-lived GHGs because of their different effects on the atmosphere. A series of successive\n“emissions budgets” that translate long-term targets into clear, short-to-medium term mitigation targets are also needed. These will\n\nprovide visible stepping stones towards the long-term goal. An independent expert body should be created to provide advice to the\nGovernment on these emissions budgets and other matters, and to regularly assess New Zealand’s progress towards its goals.\nIMHO this independent expert capacity could be incorporated into a Climate Commission. New Zealand’s transport network is\n\ndominated by private road transport. Compared to other developed countries, vehicle ownership rates are high, public transport use\nis low, and the vehicle fleet is old with poor fuel economy. Transport is one of the main sectors where deep emissions reductions are\n\nboth necessary and possible given existing and emerging technology. Electric vehicles (EVs) offer a major mitigation opportunity, but\na faster uptake is needed. The Government should encourage EVs and other low-emissions vehicles by introducing a “feebate”\n\nscheme (where vehicle importers either pay a fee, or receive a rebate, depending on the emissions intensity of the vehicle), providing\nfunding support for EV infrastructure, and encouraging government agencies to procure low-emissions vehicles. Regulating fossil-\n\nfuel vehicle imports will be required to avoid New Zealand becoming a dumping ground for old technology. Emissions standards for\nnew and used imported vehicles will help to avoid this risk. The Government should also put emissions-reduction goals more\ncentrally in government transport planning. A low-emissions electricity system that keeps the lights on New Zealand’s low-emissions\n\ntransition will rely on abundant and cheap renewable electricity. But there are trade-offs between cost, emissions, and security of\nsupply in the electricity system. Given current technology, it could be very expensive to completely eliminate GHG emissions from\n\nelectricity because of the need to have backup generation (currently supplied by fossil fuels) for those years when it does not rain\nenough to fill up the hydro lakes. Eliminating this backup generation entirely would likely raise electricity prices and discourage users\n\nof fossil fuels in other areas of the economy from switching to renewable electricity. New technologies such as tidal power may\nemerge over time, while existing technologies such as wind power and battery storage are likely to become more cost-effective. But\nit is still uncertain what paths these technologies will take. The emissions price in the NZ ETS should drive investment in electricity\n\ngeneration, rather than the Government favouring particular technologies, or setting stringent targets for electricity-sector emissions.\nRecommendations: 1 In order to increase safety on roads, and improve progress on New Zealand's low carbon goals, the speed\n\nlimits on our roads should be reviewed and reduced if appropriate. In particular, increases on some highways to 110km/hour should\nbe reversed as this normalises higher speeds and according to NZTA's Safer Driving website a vehicle travelling at 110km/hr uses on\n\naverage 25% more fuel than if it were travelling at 90Km/hr. City and suburban speeds should also be reviewed downwards in areas\nwhere safety is a concern. Speeds near schools and early childhood centres should be reduced to 30km/hour. There is a strong\n\nargument for reducing speed in most large urban environments to 30 or 40 km/hr. 2 Under Environment (\"reduces the adverse\neffects on the climate, local environment and public health\") should be a key strategic priority (like safety and access), rather than a\nsupporting one. 3 In relation to Funding and Investment Decisions, I recommend a more outcome focused approach to provide a \"a\n\nmode neutral approach to transport planning and investment decisions\" (p23), rather than allocating funding by Activity Classes 4\nThe high level of funding for state highway improvements should focus on safety and connecting communities, rather than in\n\nincreasing capacity for speeding by private vehicles. We should have quality two lane roads, four lane passing sections, and bridges\nthroughout New Zealand together with a network of electric rail, rather than a proliferation of four lane highways. 5 Plan to reflect the\n\nsafety implications of how we travel, risks associated with travelling by car are much greater than those in travelling by public\ntransport. 6 Plans to support smart use of technology with sensors and a range of communication modes. This could be coupled\nwith congestion charging and parking monitoring. 7 There should be higher priority given to planning for the impact on coastal roads\n\nof coastal erosion and sea level rise, with climate change and future earthquakes like the Kaikoura quake. 8 Develop a specific plan\nfor how central government and local authorities will work together on these issues, including plans for re-location of individuals and\n\ncommunities. 9 The Government should plan how to ensure support for households facing significant transition costs. The transition\nto a low-emissions economy presents many opportunities, but also challenges, particularly for low-income households. Government\n\npolicies could increase the costs of energy, food and transport, which may disproportionately affect these households and which can\nbe offset through the tax and welfare system. 10 The Government should put GHG emissions-reduction goals more centrally in\n\ngovernment transport planning. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/where-government-plan-new-zealands-land-transport-take-kay-\njones/"
