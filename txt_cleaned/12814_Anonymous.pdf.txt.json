      "answer_index": 1,
      "notes": "Net zero of all green house gasses. We will have to diversify our economy, as we have had to in the past. This does not need to be a\n bad change. There are opportunities if we act now."

      "answer": "Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)",
      "answer_index": 7,
      "notes": "Domestic emissions trading would be preferable. Why send millions offshore for fraudulent credits. Create a carbon market here; put\n an effective price on carbon and incentivise business to reduce emissions. It seems that most businesses who are thinking long\n\n term are asking for a price on carbon so they can adapt."

      "answer": "Yes",
      "answer_index": 3,
      "notes": "The science should dictate what we do. Do not cop out and say that we can't do anything or pander to certain sectors of the country.\n We are all in this together. Climate change shouldn't be a political football."

      "answer": "No - emissions budgets should not be able to be changed",
      "answer_index": 9,
