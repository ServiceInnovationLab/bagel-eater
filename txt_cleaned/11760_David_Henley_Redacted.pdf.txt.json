      "notes": "1. NZ should take the opportunity to consider and learn from the system wide (low-carbon) transition approaches currently underway\n in the EU flagship regions - Rotterdam, Luxembourg & Haut de France. (see below) – supported by the EU Commission funding\n priority realignment (Digital Europe). This includes learning about the process of collaborative planning and enablement in those\n\n economies and regions & the lessons from implementation. These approaches are being adopted by credible OECD economies &\n go beyond a GHG reduction framing or focus – to an economic paradigm shift / system wide framing. Hence, they offer a great\n opportunity for us to learn from and inform our transition philosophy & indeed take our approach to a new innovative level of ambition.\n\n 2. Our Transition conversation & approach would benefit from being primarily framed as a societal economic transition (that is also\n low-carbon) – that incorporates the multiple societal challenges & opportunities we face in the 21st Century, rather than a primary\n focus on GHG reductions (although these are obviously crucial). Given this would - by default - be a more systemic conversation &\n framing, it is also likely to ultimately be more impactful in reducing emissions. 3. Suggest changing the name of Climate Change\n\n Commission to something like 21st Century Transition Commission or Next Economy/New Economy (Transition) Commission to\n emphasise the systemic focus it must inform. The Transition to a low Carbon Economy could be thought of as a by-product of the\n transition to a 21st Century Economy…and if we want to find the best leverage points to achieve low emissions then starting at the\n\n economic level will be most effective."
