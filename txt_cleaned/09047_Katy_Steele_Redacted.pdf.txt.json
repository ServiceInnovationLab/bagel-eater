      "answer_index": 1,
      "notes": "NZ has high per capita carbon emissions we need to decrease these. The economic models in the discussion document (& Table 5\n\n page 30) clearly show that there is a minimal economic cost differential when achieving net zero emissions instead of the middle\n option. The environmental and societal benefits of achieving net zero emissions have not been fully costed, and are unlikely ever to\n\n be so since the environmental costs are global and interconnected. It is impossible to accurately cost the long term impact of\n environmental degradation eg loss of species, and any costings will only be considered in terms of the current known impact on\n humans."

      "answer_index": 2,
      "notes": "The priority must be to achieve domestic emission reduction first so as to incentivise a transition to a net zero carbon emission\n economy. Any international carbon units must be of high quality unlike the Kyoto protocol units."
