      "notes": "The consultation document heavily minimises the impact that methane has on the atmosphere. While methane does indeed “decay\n relatively rapidly in the atmosphere”, it has a severe impact over a short period of time. In 2013, the Intergovernmental Panel on\n\n Climate Change reported that methane has a global warming potential of 34 over a 100-year time period, and 86 over a 20-year time\n period, having a significantly higher impact on the atmosphere than carbon dioxide. Excluding or making concessions for emitters of\n methane in the short term will not be beneficial to New Zealand over the longer term."
