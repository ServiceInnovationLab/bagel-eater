      "question": "2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?",
      "question_index": 1,
      "answer": "Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived gases",
      "answer_index": 12,
      "notes": "OPTION 2 in the light of the following information I support a 2050 target which is ambitious, clear, and science-based. which allows\n for the practicalities of New Zealand’s emissions, particularly from agriculture. It is important to take a science-based approach to\n\n ensure our emission reduction efforts are as impactful as possible. This means adopting a “two basket” appproach, which\n recognises the difference between long-lived greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide) and short-lived\n greenhouse gases (such as methane). Applying a two baskets approach to achieve a net zero 2050 all gases target would mean: ●\n\n Combining long-lived gas reductions with permanent carbon sinks (e.g. through permanent forestry and carbon sequestration in soil)\n to achieve negative long-lived emissions by 2050; and ● Reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. ● Commitment to\n reducing short-lived gases like CH4 to lower levels This would balance out to net zero across all gases, but in the most impactful way\n\n possible. Short-lived gases do not need to be reduced to net zero to stop temperature rise. They only need to be stabilised. New\n Zealand should aim for a sustainable level of short-lived emissions which fits with the Paris Agreement goals to keep global warming\n\n well below 2C, striving to 1.5C. Long-lived emissions, however, contribute to global warming until they are reduced all the way to zero.\n Because these gases exist in the atmosphere for millennia, finding ways to absorb more of these gases from the atmosphere than\n the amount we are emitting (known as “negative” emissions) is the most ambitious and impactful contribution New Zealand could\n\n make to counteract global warming. Accordingly, the Zero Carbon Act should prioritise reducing long-lived emissions to net zero, and\n then to negative emissions, by 2050 or sooner. The second option provides a fair contribution from agriculture over its whole profile,\n within the context of a bipartisan political framework. The principal emphasis must be on emissions reduction across the economy,\n\n avoiding over dependence on forests, which have limited capacity in the long term. In summary: ● I supports the most ambitious,\n clearest, science-based target enabling effective consideration of the difference between gas properties. ● We need to reduce all\n\n greenhouse gases, including methane. ● Applying two baskets thinking to our 2050 target, the most ambitious and impactful\n approach would be to achieve negative long-lived gas emissions, while reducing short-lived gas emissions to sustainable levels.\n Getting to this point would mean that New Zealand is contributing to global cooling. ● Set the framework for a constructive political\n\n debate within a bipartisan framework. Note: a two baskets approach means taking a scientific approach to different gases. It does not\n mean treating the agricultural sector differently from other sectors. Nitrous oxide, which is primarily emitted through agricultural\n\n practices, is a long-lived greenhouse gas. It absolutely must be reduced to net zero. The science is clear that methane emissions\n must also be reduced. However, it is simply not necessary to reduce methane to net zero to stop global warming."
