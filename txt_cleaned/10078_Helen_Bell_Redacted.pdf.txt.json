      "notes": "Methane emissions have stabilised or increased only slightly since 1990 and lasts 7 to 10years in the environment. CO2 lasts for\n\n hundreds of years.Any reductions should focus on CO2 emissions. Reducing methane emissions will force farmers to become less\n competitive internationally. No other country is looking at methane reductions. Farmers have trees ,grass and soil which remove CO2\n and should be included in any model. How valid is the carbon unit model. A view that methane emissions are overstated in this\n\n model."
