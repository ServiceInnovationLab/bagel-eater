      "question_index": 0,
      "answer": null,
      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "The government should take an independent and detailed look at the science behind Climate Change before making any binding\n policy decisions."

      "question": "2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?",
      "question_index": 1,
      "answer": null,
      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "Greenhouse gases are likely NOT the main driver of any change in the climate. Therefore any legislation that focuses on and targets\n them is misplaced. Emissions targets therefore are not useful for the purposes for which they are proposed and will prove both\n wasteful and pointless."

      "question": "3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?",
      "question_index": 2,
      "answer": null,
      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "Rather than blindly relying on the politically motivated pronouncements, reports and publications issued by the IPCC, New Zealand\n should make up its own mind based upon facts and sound evidence. No emissions targets are necessary."
    },
    {
      "question": "4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?",
      "question_index": 3,
      "answer": "Yes",
      "answer_index": 3,
      "notes": "Given it is likely in my view that the current IPCC position on climate change will be proven to be misinformed, and assuming this bill\n\n were to go ahead, it would be prudent to allow for changed circumstances."
    },
    {
      "question": "5. The Government proposes that three emissions budgets of five years each (i.e. covering the next 15 years) be in place at any given time. Do you agree with this proposal?",
      "question_index": 15,
      "answer": "No",
      "answer_index": 8,
      "notes": "No, in light of my previous points, I don't believe that emissions budgets will have any benefit."
    },
    {
      "question": "6. Should the Government be able to alter the last emissions budget (i.e. furthest into the future)?",
      "question_index": 4,
      "answer": "Yes - each incoming Government should have the option to review the third budget in the sequence",
      "answer_index": 14,
      "notes": "As the real climate drivers become more obvious, any incoming Government would be well served by having some flexibility regarding\n emissions."

      "question": "9. Should the Zero Carbon Bill require Governments to set out plans within a certain timeframe to achieve the emissions budgets?",
      "question_index": 7,
      "answer": null,
      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "Obviously any meaningful bill would have budget time-frames, but its whole basis is fundamentally flawed in the first place."
    },
    {
      "question": "10. What are the most important issues for the Government to consider in setting plans to meet budgets? For example, who do we need to work with, what else needs to be considered?",
      "question_index": 8,
      "answer": null,
      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "They need to be sure that greenhouse gases are in fact driving climate change before enacting any such legislation. My belief is that\nour climate is primarily driven by solar cycles, solar activity and solar interactions with our ionosphere, atmosphere and\n\nmagnetosphere. Any impact derived from greenhouse gas emissions would be irrelevant to the overall climate picture."

      "question": "11. The Government has proposed that the Climate Change Commission advises on and monitors New Zealand's progress towards its goals. Do you agree with these functions? See p42 Our Climate Your Say",
      "question_index": 9,
      "answer": null,
      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "While these functions appear reasonable, they are all presupposed on the theory of greenhouse gas driven climate change and\ntherefore erroneous."

      "question": "12. What role do you think the Climate Change Commission should have in relation to the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (NZ ETS)?",

      "answer": "Advising the Government on policy settings in the NZ ETS",
      "answer_index": 6,
      "notes": "If they will in fact have the capability to offer \"independent expert advice\", then hopefully the may be able to illuminate our government\n\nas to the real climate change scenario."
    },
    {
      "question": "13. The Government has proposed that Climate Change Commissioners need to have a range of essential and desirable expertise. Do you agree with the proposed expertise? See p45 Our Climate Your Say",
      "question_index": 11,
      "answer": null,
      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "I don't agree that we need a Climate Change Commission, and it looks like any such people would without doubt be biased towards\nthe IPCC position. Therefore they would be unable to offer any truly independent, expert advice."

      "notes": "It doesn't take too much research to see that there is an entirely different and much more valid perspective by way of explanation for\nany changes we may perceive occurring to our climate. I urge decision makers to investigate for themselves prior to making any\ncostly policy decisions. While there are many websites, documents, videos and other forms or media that I could upload or link, the\n\none I chose to attach called \"Groupthink\" is a good starting point. For goodness sake, read and absorb it. I do not wish my name to\nbe published.\n\n\n\n\n You have elected to withhold your personal details from publication."
