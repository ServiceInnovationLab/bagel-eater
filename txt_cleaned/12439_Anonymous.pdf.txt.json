It makes no sense to avoid regulating it; if we do not drastically\n reduce methane emissions we will not be able to meet our international climate change obligations. The fact that methane is a short-\n lived gas should not exempt it from regulation, because it is in the short term that we face great climatic danger."

      "notes": "New Zealand has the opportunity to lead the world in climate-friendly agriculture, but this requires bold thinking. All agricultural\n\nemissions must be considered if we are to make a meaningful contribution to combatting climate change. However, we also need to\ngive farmers the opportunity to earn carbon credits by sequestering carbon in soils. The potential carbon sink in our soils is massive.\nMore research may be needed in order to design a scheme that works for NZ, however overseas countries are already looking into\n\nthis. This report from the Rodale Institute details the potential carbon sequestration power of regenerative agricultural practices:\nhttp://rodaleinstitute.org/regenerative-organic-agriculture-and-climate-change/\n\n\n\n\n You have elected to withhold your personal details from publication."
