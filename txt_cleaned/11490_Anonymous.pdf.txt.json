      "notes": "The Government should not be setting a pointless target. Any reduction of CO2 emissions that NZ achieves will be negated many\n times over by the coal fired power stations built in China and India. On a global scale, NZ does not register."

      "notes": "It should not be enacted and, if enacted, it should be repealed at the first possible opportunity. The climate has been changing for\n millenia, human effects on climate change are trivial and the bias implicit in the climate change models has been proven by the lack of\n\n warming in the past 20 years."
