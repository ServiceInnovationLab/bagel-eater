In the course of exploring the reasons for depletion of Toheroa on\n Ninety Mile Beach I discovered that in response to a relatively small increase in Temperature over the last sixty Years our Climate has\n undergone a massive change with a complete reversal in Previously Prevailing Winds . This Change is part of a global influence but\n there is a good chance that Toheroa is the disappearing Canary in the Coal Mine and the indicator for the next Native Species unable\n\n to adapt to the speed of Climate Change The factors causing the reversal of our Winds and the tropicalisation are not if ever exposed\n but are an example of powerful Change Here Today."
