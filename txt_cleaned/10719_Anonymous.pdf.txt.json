      "question_index": 0,
      "answer": "The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission advises on the specific target for the Government to set later",
      "answer_index": 11,
      "notes": "The target should be legislated now. However, the independent climate commission should be able to make the target stronger in\n\n accordance with any developments in climate change science."

      "answer": "Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)",
      "answer_index": 7,
      "notes": "The international market is unknown, could rapidly change, and this is short-term thinking which will not have long-lasting change a\n\n the domestic level - which I see as the very real reason for this Bill in the first place. NZ needs to do it's fair share, and despite\n contributing to a minority of greenhouse gases, be a world leader when it comes to climate change. Using emissions reductions from\n overseas limits the benefits the society in NZ has to benefit from the proposed changes - which not only have marked impacts on\n\n climate change but also the health and wellbeing of our society."
