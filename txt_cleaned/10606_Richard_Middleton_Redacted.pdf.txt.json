      "question": "3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?",
      "question_index": 2,
      "answer": "Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)",
      "answer_index": 7,
      "notes": "I was recently asked by a small company running ten computers how many trees it needed to plant to offset their employees leaving\n their computers and printers on overnight. I was shocked at how little impact is made by planting trees. The American government\n\n advises a tree absorbs 48lbs CO2 a year per tree. http://www.americanforests.org/explore-forests/forest-facts/ In New Zealand, we\n emit 3.76 pounds of carbon dioxide per kWh (calculated from https://www.energywise.govt.nz/tools/running-costs-calculator/#/\n Since each kWh costs 16 cents, we can back-calculate that switching off ten computers and ten little printers saves 2234.145\n\n pounds, which is more-or-less a ton, of carbon dioxide per year. To offset the great labour of leaning over and pressing a switch on\n the wall, the company needs to plant and maintain 47 mature trees. If they want to keep ten computers and ten big printers on, their\n\n needless nearly-five tons of carbon dioxide emissions amount to the company needing to plant and maintain 189 trees."

      "question": "4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?",
      "question_index": 3,
      "answer": null,
      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "If our goal is to avoid catastrophe, 2050 is far too late to have achieved zero carbon emissions. We need to pay attention to scientists\n like James Hansen, Kevin Anderson,and Peter Wadhams. They are at the top of the field of climate research and their opinions\n\n outweigh those of any other person. Business, including farming and tourism, may suggest that incomes are jeopardised by a drastic\n and immediate cessation of the use of fossil fuels, but all business is wholly jeopardised by the global collapse that prevarication will\n entail."

      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "No-one with a grasp of human frailty fails to realise how difficult it will be to persuade a reluctant population to give up a materialistic\n life. If five year targets help Government to get people to address the problem, so be it."

      "answer": "Yes",
      "answer_index": 3,

      "answer": null,
      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "Scientific advice does not seem to be sufficiently strong in the expertise outlined. This whole proposal does not appear to grasp the\n\nconsequences of inaction. We really need this issue to be on a war footing. The difficulty is that we are at war with ourselves - with our\ninertia, with our reluctance to scale back our material wants, and above all our unwillingness to examine our own normalcy bias."

      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "Above all we should be aware that climate change is one symptom of a global problem caused by unlimited growth, both of\npopulation and of standards of material well-being. The mantra of 'growth' which continues to be unquestioned, should alert us to the\n\nterrible danger we have allowed ourselves to have been led into by listening to economists rather than to scientists. There needs to\nbe a very real appraisal of the value of these two disciplines. We would do well to observe that when economists make predictions,\n\nthey are usually wrong, while the predictions made by top scientists like James Hansen have proven to be accurate."
