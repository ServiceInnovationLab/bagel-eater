      "answer": "The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now",
      "answer_index": 0,
      "notes": "I strongly support the creation of a Zero Carbon Act. Ideally we would be able to wait until the Climate Change Commission advises on\n a specific target, but we have already delayed taking meaningful action for far too long. We must act now."

      "notes": "There needs to be immediate, steep cuts to methane emissions in order to buy us some time to deal with the long term problem of\n\n CO2 and NO2 emissions, and for the Climate Commission to determine what stabilised levels of methane should be. The agricultural\n industry has to start taking responsibility for its emissions."
