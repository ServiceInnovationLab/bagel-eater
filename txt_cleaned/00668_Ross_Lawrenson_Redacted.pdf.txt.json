      "notes": "The Government seems to be ignoring the cost of air travel in its considerations. Especially travel for tourists visiting New Zealand. If\n\n we are serious about climate change then we need to stop using up fossil fuels for pleasure and concentrate on the necessities\n such as feeding the planet. It seems we want to curtail our farming industry, with a goal of making more money from agriculture but\n\n feed less people. Yet we are encouraging more and more tourists to spew CO2 into the atmosphere travelling to New Zealand to go\n bungy jumping. Tourism is a dirty industry and we should be putting 100% tax on aero fuel in the same way we put a tax on petrol.\n This would make tourism a more sustainable industry and provide more level playing field"
