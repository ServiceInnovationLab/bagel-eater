This is because the climate has always, and will always continue to, change. Sea levels, global temperature, and\n\nCO2 have throughout the course of geological history fluctuated to extremes either side of the climate's current state. These\nvariations happened long before man's industrial activity. The Paris accord is a costly waste of paper which punishes the world's\n\nlowest CO2 emitters and rewards it's worst polluters. It does nothing to reduce net CO2 emissions, and is nothing more than a global\nsocialist wealth redistribution initiative in drag."
