      "notes": "NZ farmers are the most efficient farmers with the lowest emissions in the world. We still have to feed a world population, and should\n be encouraging countries with the lowest emissions to produce it. Also, Farmers who have shelter belts should be able to use them\n\n to offset emissions. Farmers who already run a low emission system should be recognised for doing so and not disadvantaged by the\ncurrent high emitting farmers should any measuring system be brought in. In other words those farmers that are changing now\n\nshould have credits for making monetary sacrifices now for the environment instead of pushing all the boundaries and reaping as\nmuch financial reward before rules are brought in."
