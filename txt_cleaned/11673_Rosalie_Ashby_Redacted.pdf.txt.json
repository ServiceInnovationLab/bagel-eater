      "notes": "I believe - as do many other well-read, intelligent, highly educated and researching individuals ( world wide) , that reducing carbon\n\n emissions can make no more than a miniscule impact on global temperatures. I fear that the promotion of this theory has been so\n widespread and intense, coupled with the fact that it is an impossibly complex matter results in the fact that MOST people accept the\n\n mantra- so often stated, that \"the science is settled\". I am not critical as it is outside most people's time or abilities to fully research\n the matter. Other supporters are so fully entrenched in the matter that they do not dare to extricate themselves, or cannot, or will not\n allow any questions. I am aware of decades of emotional debate, and I know that many scientists have resigned, been refused\n\n promotion, or restricted in many ways so they cannot share their viewpoints, and certainly not able to publish in scientific\n publications. Many of the public believe those who question are selfishly self-seeking but I know this is often not the case. I believe\n\n New Zealand to be a fine leader with opportunities to lead in other areas. I am sorry but this is the only way I can say it. Please see\n extra comments below. Thank you."

Sea level rises will continue at a slow\n\n and steady rate so some protection has to be given in certain places, eg Tamaki Drive in Auckland. It is also important that the\n government consider the possibility of cooling temperatures which could happen quite rapidly - although unlikely."

      "notes": "Thank you yes. I am very keen to make comment as I do hope my attitude - beliefs will be recorded. I have done months of close\nstudy on this subject. I have studied,equally, both \"sides\" of the debate. I used to be a secondary school teacher, now retired, which\n\nis why I am able to take this time. I used to teach the topic \"Climate Change\". I have read the IPCC reports plus the recent \"Climate\nupdates. What have we learned since the IPCC 5th assessment report\". I understand the reports and I understand why all the\n\ninformation is so extremely persuasive. I believe that the opposing ideas from the scientific( and other) communities is not published.\nI believe that while climate is changing - of course, as it always has, that this is NOT caused by carbon dioxide which is one of the\nlesser of the GHGs.. CO2 is a boon to our planet Earth. Climate warming rate is not unprecedented , we are emerging from a 300 year\n\nwarming period but in the last 18 years climate warming has slowed and the rate does not correspond with the increase in CO2\nwhich has been rising since the 1850s. For 80% of its existence Earth has been warmer than today. Other climate forces have often\n\noverridden the warming effect of CO2 and Greenhouse gases. Man's input to climate warming through carbon emissions is miniscule.\nThe very best explanation for this widely held point of view is in a excellent book which although written by a scientist, Howard\n\nThomas Brady , is fairly accessible to a lay person. Those who hold the prevailing and therefore widely publicised Government and\nacademic viewpoint of worrying manmade global warming have not read this book. it is the only very recent full discussion of every\naspect of the complexity of the multi-cyclical climate systems ( described in science as \"chaotic\") and it explains all aspects of the\n\nover-simplicity of the IPCC's thesis. This I find most disturbing. I am completely\" neutral with no position to protect but I am totally\ndismayed to realise that it is impossible to get any \"opposing\" view published or heard. For this reason I believe our Government is\n\nabout to embark on a most complex \" revolution\" based on a totally incorrect simplistic premise - that of man-made carbon emissions\ncausing global warming. I totally support all efforts to improve the state of our Earth - any action that improves the water, soil, ocean,\n\nair quality etc - ie pollution is totally to be applauded. I believe the other 127 nations who signed the Paris accord are also being\nmislead by the IPCC. I believe most people are innocent of the deceptions and truely believe they can \"see' the effects of (manmade)\n\nwarming and the graphs showing increasing CO2 since 1850 are most persuasive and beguiling. Usually part of the \"silent majority\" ,\nand following months of intense and honest study on this subject I am very insistent that my point of view - which is not uncommon,\nbe registered. Unfortunately very few people are able to undertake this level of personal research as they are genuinely too busy or\n\ninsufficiently educated and therefor only too willing to believe \"what the science community\" is appearing to say. Therefore NZ should\nNOT be a leader in this charade but use our worthy and considerable influence and our precious funds in other directions - pure\n\nresearch and education and of course the development of alternative fuel/power sources. Thank you for the opportunity - I do hope\nthis reaches some objective ears."
