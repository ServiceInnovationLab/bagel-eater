      "answer": "Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050",
      "answer_index": 1,
      "notes": "It is important to be as ambitious as possible. There is mounting evidence that the upper temperature goal of the Paris Agreement\n (“2°C above pre-industrial levels”) would be a dangerous step for humanity. Climate legislation should reflect the need to pursue\n\n efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C."

      "answer": "No",
      "answer_index": 8,
      "notes": "Allowing the 2050 target to be revised is potentially dangerous and undermines the concept of long-term planning certainty. The only\n\n exceptional justification for altering it would be a significant disruption e.g. in the scientific understanding of climate change."

      "answer_index": 3,
      "notes": "One additional factor that should be considered is the effects of climate change in developing countries, especially in our Pacific\n\n neighbourhood, and the likely impact of the decision on New Zealand's relations with Pacific partner governments as well as\n reputation and credibility in international fora."

      "answer": null,
      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "It is important not to overlook the fact that climate change is a global phenomenon that disproportionately affects developing\ncountries, including in our own Pacific neighbourhood. Our plans for ambitious domestic-facing action should be matched by equally\n\nambitious plans to provide international climate change assistance. To that end, New Zealand should be working closely with Pacific\ngovernments, regional bodies, civil society and international NGOs helping local communities adapt to the impacts of climate change."

      "answer": "Yes",
      "answer_index": 3,
      "notes": "The Climate Change Commission should also include expertise to monitor and report on New Zealand's international climate change\ncontributions under the Paris agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. It would be valuable to see the Commission draw\n\nattention to the issue of how New Zealand provides climate-related support to developing countries e.g. via climate finance for\nadaptation and mitigation, particularly in the Pacific. As such, the Zero Carbon Bill should include a requirement for Government to\n\nproduce regular reports on New Zealand’s international climate finance and climate-related Official Development Assistance."

      "answer": "Yes",
      "answer_index": 3,
      "notes": "As above: At least two Commissioners should be able to monitor and provide expert advice on New Zealand's climate action in\nsupport of developing countries. This would require them to have in-depth understanding of international climate and development\nframeworks as well as climate policy priorities in developing countries, especially in the Pacific."

      "answer": "Yes",
      "answer_index": 3,
      "notes": "For enhanced policy coherence and coordination, the Zero Carbon Bill should also outline / reference New Zealand's efforts to assist\ndeveloping countries, including in the Pacific, adapt to climate change. It would be valuable to use insights from and decisions for the\n\nNational Adaptation Plan to inform New Zealand’s international assistance to vulnerable people and countries, and vice-versa."

      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback. As outlined above, I would again like to highlight that the Zero Carbon Bill is a\nunique opportunity to ensure that we contribute to a positive future in developing countries who are among the most vulnerable to\n\nimpacts such as changing weather patterns and sea level rise. As such, the Bill should include strong references to New Zealand's\ninternational commitments under the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement, notably Articles 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 on\n\ndeveloped country support to developing countries, particularly in the area of adaptation. The Climate Commission could play a key\nrole in monitoring and strengthening our contributions in the global fight against climate change. A national adaptation plan could\ninclude policy guidance on our adaptation support overseas. In short, please ensure the Zero Carbon Bill will not only drive\n\nmeaningful climate action at home but also across the developing world."
