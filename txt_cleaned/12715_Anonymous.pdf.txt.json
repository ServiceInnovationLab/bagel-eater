      "question": "2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?",
      "question_index": 1,
      "answer": "Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050",
      "answer_index": 1,
      "notes": "Out of the three choices offered, I support net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050 as it is the most ambitious, and\n therefore the most just, of the three options. However, in order to play our part in keeping overall warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius\n\n above pre-industrial levels, New Zealand should be aiming to have net zero emissions by 2040 rather than 2050. The option I\n support (net zero emissions) should not preclude taking a \"two-baskets\" approach to long-lived and short-lived gases - we should\n aim for negative levels of long-lived gases by the target date, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. Emphasis should\n\n be placed on reducing fossil fuel based emissions swiftly given that untapped fossil fuel supplies are a much safer store of carbon\n than biological offsets likes forests which can be subject to fire and disease."

      "answer": "Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)",
      "answer_index": 7,
      "notes": "It is imperative (economically and morally) that New Zealand's economy becomes carbon-neutral as soon as possible - hence the\n\n target in the Zero Carbon Act should be met from domestic emissions reductions only. However, New Zealand has international legal\n and moral responsibilities to support and assist in mitigation and adaptation in developing countries through mechanisms such as\n additional aid, or perhaps purchasing international carbon credits. These measures should be additional to New Zealand's domestic\n\n mitigation measures. The New Zealand government should also be careful that the resources it supplies to developing countries to\n mitigate and adapt to climate change empower the local people rather being a form of economic colonisation by stealth."

      "answer": "Yes",
      "answer_index": 3,
      "notes": "I agree with 5-year budgets set 10-15 years in advance so that three will be in place at any given time. However, having intermediate\n\n goals within five-year budgets and annual reporting (at least) against those goals will be important to ensure that emissions\n reductions are not pushed to the end of those periods. The cumulative amount that New Zealand is responsible for emitting up to\n\n 2050 is important - the budgets should be made so that New Zealand's emissions are cut drastically in the first set of five-year plans."

      "answer_index": 3,
      "notes": "I agree with the factors proposed in the discussion documents. However, I think that there is should be particular emphasis placed\n\non the government's obligations under Te Tiriti o Waitangi - climate change action should be used to empower, rather than further\ndisenfranchise, tangata whenua. The Government and the Climate Change Commission should engage with tangata whenua and\n\nMaori world views when setting budgets. The Government and Climate Change Commission should also be considering fairness\n(intra- and inter-generational equity) and environmental sustainability when setting budgets. They should also be taking into account\n\nNew Zealand's contributions to international aviation and maritime emissions. The Government and Climate Change Commission\nshould be applying a precautionary approach when deciding what emissions trajectory that is consistent with the collective obligation\nunder the Paris Agreement to keep warming to 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. They should also be seeking to front-load\n\nemissions reductions to reduced the cumulative amount that New Zealand emits up to the target date."

      "notes": "We must learn from the mistake's of the UK's Climate Change Act and specify a strict timeframe for producing a plan. However, that\n\ntime should be sufficient for the Climate Change Commission and Government to engage with the public (particularly tangata whenua\nand young people) as to our values and priorities relating to climate change so that we as a society have collective ownership of our\n\nclimate action plans."

      "notes": "The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be comprehensive, fair (within current generations and between\ncurrent and future generations), cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and reflect our foundational commitment to Te Tiriti o\n\nWaitangi. In setting plans to meet the emissions budgets, the government should be: - engaging with and considering devolving\npower and resources to tangata whenua to enable action on priority areas for tangata whenua. - listening to and considering Maori\n\nworld views. - consulting and working with local government to encourage local and regional efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate\nchange. - engaging with the general public, particularly minorities and young people, about our values and priorities for climate\nchange action and, if necessary, educating the public about the various options. - considering New Zealand's consumption\n\nemissions (the emissions costs of things done or produced overseas that benefit New Zealanders/are used here) and in particular\nthe relative consumption emissions and other environmental impacts of the various mitigation and adaptation measures (eg the\n\nemissions cost of producing electric cars overseas). - considering the impact of its current activities on other planetary boundaries\n(eg biodiversity, nutrient pollution) and, in particular, the relative impacts/benefits of various adaptation and mitigation measures. -\n\ntaking into account New Zealand's contribution to international aviation and maritime emissions and the effects of mitigation and\nadaptation policy on those emissions. - making sure they're based on the best science available. - taking into account the\nimportance of minimising New Zealand's cumulative emissions up to the target date by front-loading emissions reductions. - taking\n\ninto account the justice implications of climate change impacts and the relative costs/benefits to already disadvantaged groups of\nmitigation/adaptation measures. - ensuring a just transition for workers in sunset industries. - encouraging innovation."
