Need to explore legislative measures to ensure that the government of the day is held accountable. The ballot box is\nsimply not suitable in this situation. Need other measures in addition to this. Monitoring is useful but not sufficient to keep a\n\ngovernment focused on the task especially with so many lobby groups wanting their interests to be excluded from measures\nrequiring the reduction of warming gases."
