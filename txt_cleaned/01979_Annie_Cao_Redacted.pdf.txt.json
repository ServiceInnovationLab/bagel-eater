      "answer_index": 1,
      "notes": "I support taking a science-based approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible: we should aim for\n negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels. I support moving away from agriculture as\n\n the foundation of our economy. We need to be investing in industries that are of higher value and do not cause environmental\n destruction within our own country."

      "answer_index": 2,
      "notes": "I consider a small amount of emissions reduction credits from overseas can be used. However there must be cap on the volume of\n credits that can be used. I suggest this is a small amount of around 20%. The majority of the effort has to be domestic reductions."
