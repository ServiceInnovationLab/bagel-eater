      "notes": "Government should present the projected carbon emissions for the following year alongside its yearly financial budget. This is the\n\nperiod during which significant public attention is placed on the government and its plans - and the link should be made directly\nbetween these plans and their carbon implications at this time. My concern is that under the proposed structure, there is very little\naccountability for a government with respect to these budgets. Once every 5 years we'll get a little media story that the government\n\nhasn't met the target. A government might easily blame the previous, or 'exceptional circumstances' - we've had two major\nearthquakes in the past decade, and there's plenty of change on the horizons so it shouldn't be difficult to come up with something\n\nthat sounds plausible. What actual consequence is there to be for not meeting the budget? If instead plans and projections were\nreported annually (though the budgets themselves could continue to be set 5 yearly), then a much greater level of scrutiny could be\n\nleveled on a government's performance."
