      "question": "3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?",

      "answer": "Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)",
      "answer_index": 7,
      "notes": "Significant pathways to emissions reduction for New Zealand include, (apart from tree planting), 1. The substitution of fossil fuels with\n carbon neutral biofuel for transport, electricity generation, and industrial process, institutional and domestic heating, 2. Sequestration\n of carbon for soil remediation with the use of charcoal either as by-product of industrial heat from biofuel, or purpose produced bio-\n\n char with heat as the by-product, 3. Remediation of agricultural soils degraded by conventional practices, with restoration of complete\n natural soil biomes of microflora and microfauna. (Note, an astounding amount of carbon has been released to the atmosphere from\n\n this source). (Christine Jones, 2009) These pathways are currently available or are in immediate view. Examples follow: Biofuel\n cropping. Giant miscanthus on marginal land, a high yeilding perennial crop maturing in 3 years, is the preferred species for\n production of renewable diesel fuel, but is also a superior soil conditioner with carbon sequestration,(Renquist & Kerckhoffs 2012). It\n\n would also serve as feedstock for synthesis gas production of other hydrocarbon liquid fuels via the Fischer-Tropsch process.\n Advanced combustion techniques. MILD (flameless) combustion gives highest heat energy yields with lowest noxious emissions yet\n achieved (CO < 1 ppm, NOx < 50ppm), and is ideal for burning even high moisture content biofuels. The submitter has been able to\n\n demonstrate that this technique works at a 5-10kWe power level and can sustainably consume billet wood directly off-the-stump,\n when coupled to a pyrolytic gasifier. Thus making very low emissions small scale industrial and domestic burners possible. Application\n\n of this type of burner to institutional and domestic heating has far reaching implications. For example, it is possible to configure a\n domestic burner to work on a 24hr fuel cycle in which the burner is fueled but once per day. Refueling done just prior to the evening\n national electric energy peak would contribute to the reduction of the evening peak load, and to the following morning peak. At the\n\n conclusion of out-gassing charcoal remains that can be used to sustain the fuel chamber temperature until the next fresh fuel\n loading occurs. A hot start to a new fuel cycle ensures a very fast return to MILD operating temperatures so that there are never any\n\n visible particulate emissions. Melhuish suggests that energy efficiency retrofits of 600,000 under-insulated homes, together with\n adoption of MILD-combustion wood burners in 30,000 hard-to-heat houses could eliminate the need for 6-7 new fossil gas fired\n electric peaking stations in the period to 2050."
