      "answer": "Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)",

      "notes": "Ban the burning of wood for domestic heating! It is extremely toxic and full of group 1 carcinogens. It is the biggest source of carbon\n in NZ by far. Subsidize heat pumps again. Overall, Biomass Burning is the largest source of primary fine carbonaceous particles and\n\n the second largest source of trace gases in the global atmosphere (Bond et al., 2004; Andreae and Merlet, 2001; Forster et al.,\n 2007; Guenther et al., 2006) The whole carbon neutral thing is a lie. Think about it for a minute. You are blasting all the carbon from a\n tree into the air in 5 minutes when that tree would otherwise be absorbing carbon from fossil fuels for the next 100 years. Then you\n\n plant another tree, which takes at least 25 years to start absorbing the same carbon as the one you cut down. But wait, the\n replacement tree is cut down at 25 years old. While all this is going on trees are not able to die naturally and release soil organic\n carbon back into the soil, which new trees need to grow. Eventually the soil is completely stripped of soil organic carbon, which is\n\n now in the atmosphere. How is that either carbon neutral or sustainable?"
