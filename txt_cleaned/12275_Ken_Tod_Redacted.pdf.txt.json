      "notes": "Withdraw from the Paris Agreement and put the money saved into supporting work to return the natural environment to it's best and\n forget about climate change. Climate change is an natural cycle that is very complex and not well understood by the scientific\n community. Climate change will occur regardless of what we do."

      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "This government has proven itself unable to plan and has done away with the targets in various areas the previous government had,\n\nsuch as in Health. Setting out plans would all be for show anyway. you will not measure anything and will falsify any results anyway."
