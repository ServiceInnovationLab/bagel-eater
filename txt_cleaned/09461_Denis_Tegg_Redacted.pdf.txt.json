      "notes": "It is essential to differentiate long-lived and short-lived gases (a two basket approach) in developing policies and strategies for\n\n implementation. In addition, distinguish between fossil methane and biological methane in policies. Methane must be cut first cut\n deeply and fast, to a level supported by science – to be determined by the Commission, and fossil methane must be put in the same\n basket as the other fossil fuels. Methane is a much more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. The initial warming from a\n\n pulse of methane is 120 times the same quantity of carbon dioxide. Growth in methane emissions will do more short-term damage\n than growth in any other gas. We all agree methane levels have to be stabilized – the real question is at what level? The discussion\n\n paper is silent on this issue. It would be a huge mistake cut methane by just 5% – back to the 1990 level – then stabilise – as\n suggested by Federated Farmers. Methane, even with its short life, currently contributes a third of our warming emissions, and it must\n come down, fast, along with all other gases. We cannot lose sight of the fact that we must move fast to cut back methane emissions\n\n to a much lower level, then hold them at that level. It makes no sense to delay methane cuts only to have to cut them much further in\n the future. With methane – time is of the essence. We may be able to reduce methane levels by technological changes in animal\n diets. But this will of itself not be enough. We cannot avoid the reality that we need to reduce the numbers of animals which produce\n\n methane and nitrous oxide. We also need to change farming methods so that these animals are farmed much less intensively and\n with less pharmaceuticals, imported feed and fertiliser. Methane emissions also come from natural gas leaks from the fuel system.\n\n These emissions need to be distinguished and put in a different basket from biological methane, and they should go to zero along\n with all other fossil fuels."

Adaptation must be treated as equally important work and resourced equally as mitigation, as a central part of the\n\nCommissions’ work. 2. The consultation paper seeks views on the respective roles of Central Government and the Commission and\nsuggests a series of adaptation provisions including a national climate change risk assessment, a national adaptation plan, a regular\nreview of progress towards implementing the plan, and an adaptation reporting power. All of these provisions are strongly supported.\n\n3. However, there is little if any discussion in the consultation document about how these risk assessments and plans are going to\nbe implemented at the regional and local level. At the moment we have the New Zealand Coastal Policy statement, and the\n\nGuidelines for Local authorities on coastal hazards which are designed to guide implementation. Whilst the NZCPS has statutory\nweight as a high-level planning document, the Guidance is just that – guidance. The Guidance has no force at law. My experience\n\nlocally with the Thames-Coromandel District Council is that in a series of very poor decisions it has been willing to ignore both the NZ\nCPS and the Guidance – both the 2008 and the latest 2017 versions. I refer you to a series of excellent articles written by Eloise\nGibson in Newsroom which document these poor decisions. The Guidance is simply not mentioned at all in resource consent\n\ndecisions. - refer attachment - re Richmond Villas - Submission to Review Consent - a case history of poor decision making on sea\nlevel rise and coastal hazards 4. Unfortunately, the Thames-Coromandel District Council has continued to consent risky coastal\n\ndevelopment without even mentioning the latest 2017 Guidelines and without any consideration at all of the NZ CPS. (I have written\nto both the Minister of Conservation, and the Minister for the Environment relating to a recent resource consent and building consent\n\napplication for a property at 366 Ngati Maru Highway and wish those emails to form part of the submission) In this most recent\nresource consent application, and at least four other applications I'm aware of which were consented in 2017, the Thames-\n\nCoromandel District Council's consideration of the NZ CPS consisted of a one line statement that the application was \"consistent\nwith\" the NZ CPS. There was no detailed analysis of the objectives and policies in that Statement whatsoever. 5. The National Risk\nAssessment and the National Adaptation Plan are presumably intended as high-level planning documents with similar status as the\n\nNZ CPS. However, relying on past experience with the way that the NZ CPS has been discounted or ignored, – this suggests that\nthese new risk assessment and adaptation plans could be also ignored and discounted in a similar way. The law must ensure that\n\nthese mistakes are not repeated. 6. Another example of the manner in which the objectives and policies in the NZ CPS have been\nignored can be found in the fact that the Thames-Coromandel District Council's just completed District Plan Review deliberately\n\nchose to only identify erosion coastal hazard while deliberately choosing to not tackle coastal flooding (inundation) hazard. This\ndecision clearly flies in the face of the requirements in the NZ CPS to identify all coastal hazards starting with those that are most\nrisky. This decision to ignore coastal flooding hazard was made although serious coastal flooding had caused millions of dollars of\n\ndamage in the Thames suburb of Moanataiari and elsewhere in Thames and on the Thames Coast. There are also numerous reports\ncommissioned by coastal hazard experts – e.g. for the Waikato Regional Council - which identify coastal flooding as a more serious\n\nhazard in that District than erosion. Although the policies in the NZ CPS clearly require these inundation hazards to be identified,\nthere does not appear to be any way that these policies can be enforced. The fact that eight years later the Thames-Coromandel\n\nDistrict Council has not complied with the NZ CPS, seems to be of little concern the Central Government. What is also clear is that law\nreform is required urgently and cannot await on councils to make any changes through their Plan Review process which may be 10\n\nyears away or more in some cases. 7. It is likely that this cavalier treatment of the Policy Statement and the Guidelines is being\nrepeated around the country by other smaller under resourced councils. What this clearly indicates is that for any adaptation\nmeasures to be successful they must be written into any new law as being mandatory and also enforceable. Otherwise experience\n\nwould suggest that smaller under resourced councils in particular will continue to turn a blind eye to these provisions. Whilst an\nadaptation risk assessment and plan are supported, they will be ineffective unless implementation of those plans at the level of\n\nresource and building consents is made mandatory and enforceable. 8. The consultation document talks about \"setting up the right\ntools for decision makers\". This only goes part of the way. We need to ensure that whatever tools are set up are in fact used AND\n\nimplemented and if they are not that there are sanctions on regional and local authorities for failing to do so. 9. Similarly, the\nconsultation document states \"through primary legislation we introduce a way to assess risks and create a plan to adapt we can take\na broad view and ensure the right settings are in place to respond\". Again, this is laudable, but how does Central Government ensure\n\nthat these \"settings\" are indeed followed by decision-makers at the regional and local level, and further, what action if any can Central\nGovernment take to ensure that these \"settings\" are enforced? The statement that a compulsory national climate change risk\n\nassessment is introduced is supported, but that compulsion must extend to ensure implementation and enforcement at regional\nand local consent making decision making. 10. The consultation document suggests there be five yearly updates of the climate\n\nchange risk assessment and plans. Given the current rapidly changing nature of our knowledge about for example sea level rise and\nthe rapidly increasing melting of the Antarctica ice shelves, (tripling in the last 5 years) it is suggested that a five yearly review is not\n\nsufficiently frequent. My recommendation is that this timeframe be amended to 3 yearly. This work is too important to be caught off\nguard by rapidly changing research and data. 11. I agree with the proposition that Central Government should initiate the first risk\nassessment. This work is urgent and must not be delayed. The consultation document says the national adaptation plan would\n\nidentify priority actions for addressing risk, including assisting and prioritising vulnerable people and regions. I also strongly agree with\nthat proposition. In my own region for example there are several towns, such as Thames which has been identified as being in the\n\ntop 10 of any town or city in New Zealand in terms of risk from sea level rise. This risk assessment was undertaken in a desktop\nfashion and has not taken account of a series of other cascading risks such as land subsidence on the foreshore, severely\n\ncontaminated soils in land which will be inundated by groundwater and direct inundation from the sea, groundwater intrusion which\ncould occur with as little as 10 cm of sea level rise. The social deprivation index shows that these at risk areas on the Thames\nforeshore have a social deprivation score 9 or 10 making them severely socially deprived. In addition, the Thames-Coromandel\n\nDistrict Council has a limited rating base and will simply not be in a position to afford the necessary risk assessment, adaptive\nplanning. It is therefore hugely urgent that a comprehensive risk assessment be carried out to assist towns such as Thames and\n\nother Coromandel settlements. 12. Also, as mentioned above, in the absence of a detailed risk assessment, the Thames-\nCoromandel District Council (most likely many other councils also?) are continuing to grant resource and building consents to clearly\n\nrisky coastal development when considered in the context of sea level rise and climate change. These maladaptive practices are\ngoing to prove very damaging and costly and we therefore urgently need not only the risk assessments, but law reform which\nrequires these risks to be taken into account, and also clear and enforceable legal sanctions to dissuade councils from continuing\n\nthese poor practices. This law reform cannot wait on District plan reviews. 13. I agree that the government, rather than the\nCommission should hold responsibility for the national adaptation plan. 14. I agree that the adaptation reporting power should apply\n\nto all Crown entities or state-owned enterprises, all local and central government and private companies that provide public services\nand most important that this power must be included in legislation and made mandatory. As the consultation document confirms,\n\nmandatory reporting has resulted in the UK and higher standard of reporting. 15. I submit that new legislation should require local\nauthorities to anticipate the implications of climate impacts on the more vulnerable, such as occurs in other planning regime such as\n\nNorway, Mexico, and Taiwan. 16. I also submit that sea level risk, even if it has not yet been confirmed in a national risk assessment\nmust be included in all Land Information Memorandum. For example, the Waikato Regional Council has a coastal flooding simulator\nwhich provides indicative (but not site specific) information on sea level rise. I approach the Thames-Coromandel District Council over\n\na year ago suggesting that by law they were required to include a reference to this simulator in all LIMs. The Council initially strongly\nrefused to do this based on faulty legal advice, but after some serious legal persuasion they have now agreed to include a reference\n\nto the coastal flooding simulator in all LIMs. The Kapiti Coast District Council High Court decision made it clear that provided the\nreference to the information is clearly worded, indicative information of sea level rise should be included in LIM reports, even where\n\nthat information is not specific to a particular certificate of title. The Court stated quite clearly that a reference to generic information\nshould still be included in LIMs . A Simpson Grierson legal opinion written for the Local Government NZ confirm that view also. An\nurgent amendment to the law is required so that councils are in no doubt about their obligations in this regard, and prospective\n\npurchasers are fully informed of the risks associated with coastal property. Refer attachment - Letter to Thames Coromandel District\nCouncil submitting that indicative sea flood maps must be referenced in LIM reports 17. The law requires amendment to make it clear\n\nto decision-makers in the planning field as to how they must deal with issues such as the future abandonment or loss of coastal\nproperty. An Australian review (Macintosh et al 2013) identified a range of legal tools and instruments that can be used to influence\n\nthe spatial distribution and nature of land use and development and hence the exposure of sediments to climate hazards. – Refer\n\"Communities and Climate Change: A vulnerability to rising seas and more frequent flooding\" – Motu Note #29 January 2018. The law\n\nneeds to be able to deal effectively with abandoned or substandard properties resulting from incremental climate related impacts. 18.\nIn the recommendations from the Climate Change Adaptation Technical Working Group \"Adapting to Climate Change in New Zealand\"\nthe Working Group identified that \"land-use planning frameworks are not currently effective in reducing risk from the effects of climate\n\nchange. This is due to: • lack of clear legal mandate for councils to plan for and take action under the RMA to reduce climate related\nrisk • competing objectives across legislation and policies relating to climate change and adaptation, and with the resilience and\n\ndisaster risk reduction. • The inadequacy of assessment and planning tools being used under the RMA to account for changing risk\nand uncertainty is when planning now for long-time frames • strengthening central government leadership of adaptation will help\n\ndrive action. 19. The Working Group recommended a series of law reforms on which I comment as follows – (a) I agree the Local\nGovernment Act 2002 should be amended to specify climate change adaptation as a function of local government. This will help\nintegrate adaptation into other local authority functions. But of itself is not sufficient to ensure that local authorities carry out this as a\n\ncore function. The law requires highly specific and unequivocal direction as to how local government carries out this core function. (b)\nI agree the RMA should be amended to include new tests relating to \"significant risks\" and likelihood\" of natural hazards (c I agree\n\nthat all planning, building, and risk management decisions, including long-term and infrastructure plans need to be considered over a\n100-year time frame to ensure consistentcy with the NZ CPS. 20. I agree that the Building Act 2004 and the Building Code also need\n\nto have 100-year time frames. The inconsistency between the NZ CPS and the Guidelines on Coastal Hazards and the Building Act is\nunworkable. In addition, there needs to be amendments to the Building Act relating to the notation on titles of natural hazards under\n\nsection 72 and 73. As things stand, councils are able to grant a resource consent for a dodgy coastal development but then have\nvery limited ability to decline a building consent on the grounds of natural hazards which only compounds Council’s initial error. In my\nexperience in most cases an unsuitable compromise is made where a section 72 notation is placed on the title, (which is intended to\n\nprotect the Council from liability) but no serious inquiries made into whether the building consent should have been issued in the first\nplace. These existing provisions allow serious maladaptive practices. 21. A further problem with the RMA is the provisions relating to\n\npublic notification. In my experience from the Thames-Coromandel District, numerous resource consents have been non-notified\n(quite properly under the existing provisions) and have been granted without any public input, notwithstanding that they involved\n\nmajor developments which were clearly in breach of the provisions of the latest Guidance and of the NZ CPS. The public and\ninterested parties had no opportunity to bring evidence relating to coastal hazards and the dubious nature of these applications –\nthey are presented with a fait accompli, - often only being aware that the application has been consented after the event.\n\nAmendment of the public notifications provisions in the RMA is required to ensure that local authorities are held properly accountable\nfor their decisions. Certainly, it should be a provision that the appropriate Minister(s) and the relevant Regional Council should be\n\nnotified of every coastal resource consent application and have the right enshrined in law to make submissions and bring evidence\nrelating to that application. 22. A further reform I would recommend is that the appropriate Minister is able to \"call in\" or to re-hear\n\nrequire a rehearing with appropriate expert evidence, of any application which is deemed to be to have been heard without proper\nconsideration of climate change/adaptation issues"
