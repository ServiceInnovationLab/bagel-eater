      "answer_index": 1,
      "notes": "Per the Ministry for the Environment, agriculture GHG emissions make up 49.2% of our total, and carbon is not the main issue there.\n\n Any targets that exclude the main GHG emissions from agriculture would be avoiding a significant part of the issue as unfortunately\n industry that has prominent release of short-lived gases are common in New Zealand. For any legislation to be effective, it needs to\n\n cover all of the issue green house gases."

      "answer": "Yes",
      "answer_index": 3,
      "notes": "It would be bold to assume that we can predict all of the challenges that New Zealand will face with climate change, and the potential\n for revision if necessary is important. However the accountability referred to in question one is also important. I still fall on the side of\n\n being strict, however a means or revision in exceptional circumstances would be useful. This should only be used with thorough\n consideration from the climate commission to prevent parties that may be less willing to do what is necessary for the environment\n\n from abusing it. Should circumstances worsen however and action be necessary in a shorter time frame, this revision method should\n not be a means for stopping New Zealand from adjusting to more ambitious targets."
