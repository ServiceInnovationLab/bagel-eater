      "answer": "The Government sets a 2050 target in legislation now",
      "answer_index": 0,
      "notes": "It needs provide certainty to everyone (including businesses wanting to invest in emission reduction technologies). It should be hard\n to change and be able withstand short term changes in political environment or as a knee jerk reaction to external factors."

      "question": "2. If the Government sets a 2050 target now, which is the best target for New Zealand?",
      "question_index": 1,
      "answer": "Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050",
      "answer_index": 1,
      "notes": "My least preferred option is limiting the target to Net Zero Carbon Dioxide only. Even without the need to mitigate climate change,\n\n export market preferences and externally driven technological advances (eg plant-based and lab-grown proteins) have the potential\n to significantly change our land use over the next few decades. This reinforces the need for NZ to prepare for, be ready to adapt to\n\n changes in land use. In other words even if we choose a lesser emissions reduction target its likely our land use will still significantly\n change. In my view we'll be better placed in the long run to factor in low emission land uses into this. NZ's land use has not been\n static over time (eg at a localised level the shift from farming to vineyards in Hawkes Bay, and the change in Havelock North away from\n\n apple orchards to increased urbanisation, and at a national level reduced sheep farming and increased dairying."

      "question": "3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?",
      "question_index": 2,
      "answer": "Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)",
      "answer_index": 7,
      "notes": "I think it will be necessary to include high quality ICUs in the mix, but this should be done in a manner which doesn't undermine the\n drive to reduce domestic emissions (i.e. the ability to use these, or the extent they can be relied on should be capped and/or\n reduced over time). The criteria on pg 33 of the consultation document make sense to be adopted. Need also to improve\n\n environmental management and oversight of forestry operations, particularly in high risk catchments (such as Gisborne,\n Nelson/Marlborough). The public need to have confidence in the shift to substantially increasing forest plantings isn't going to be\n\n detrimental to the environment overall, or come with its own costs for infrastructure repair and remediation costs falling on LG and\n ratepayers)."
