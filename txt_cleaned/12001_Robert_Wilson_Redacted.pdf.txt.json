      "notes": "It' a complete nonsense. The so-called scientific consensus is irrelevant. Science is about data. The FACT is that such data is publicly\n available from authoritative sources. This includes organisations such as NASA (including its various satellites such as the NSIDC) ,\n\n the EPA and even Google Earth. Lets take a simple example. The NSIDC commentary on Antarctic sea ice indicates that the continent\n has been gaining an additional 1.8% of ice over the past 3 decades. When you follow a link from NSIDC to Google Earth you are\n presented with a time lapse series of images (1979-2018) that shows absolutely no change in the amount of ice present in\n\n Antarctica and yet we have been told only recently that we should all be alarmed by the impact of climate change in the region. Also\nwe have been told that we have been facing unprecedented levels of record temperatures. This information is derived from tortured\n\ndata that comes from surface based temperature measurements. Satellite measurements are infinitely more accurate and can\nmonitor temperatures anywhere in the world. The UAH (University of Huntsville Alabama) show that temperatures are not tracking up\n\nand if anything are trending down. These are only a small number of examples. There are many more. They indicate that what is\npassing as science is nothing of the sort but is propaganda of a quality that Joseph Goebbels would be proud of. So to do something\n\nabout a non issue is the very definition of stupidity."
