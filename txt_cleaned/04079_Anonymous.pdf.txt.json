As an example we should not resist the transition the EVs to prevent economic losses to owners of petrol\n\nstations - owners of potentially stranded assets need to adapt or fail."

      "notes": "I would like to see greater incentives for EVs. NZ has great existing infrastructure for EVs but very weak incentives - far lower than\nmany other countries despite our clear advantages in this area. We also risk being a dumping ground for stranded ICE vehicles. There\n\nis significant pent up demand internationally for quality EVs and only limited production capacity (look at the Tesla Model 3 waiting list\n& the Hyundai Kona EV is sold out in many markets). We may also see ICE vehicles being more aggressively marketed in NZ as they\nlose market share to EVs internationally - this is an inevitable market response in countries without incentives or fuel efficiency\n\nrequirements. My household will be replacing one of our vehicles at the end of the year and I am actively shopping for a suitable EV,\nhowever my options are either too expensive or unsuitable. I also consider the environmental benefits of PHEVs to be overstated, as\n\nwell as economics not stacking up considering the additional upfront cost and maintenance. The feebate system proposed by the\nProductivity Commission would make the higher upfront cost of a suitable EV more palatable.\nYou have elected to withhold your personal details from publication."
