      "question": "1. What process should the Government use to set a new emissions reduction target in legislation?",
      "question_index": 0,
      "answer": "The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission advises on the specific target for the Government to set later",
      "answer_index": 11,
      "notes": "I would prefer to leave more time for the research to become clearer around what is the appropriate way to deal with methane. And\n specifically for this science to be well communicated to the public and understood and accepted by those it affects, before it\n becomes law. Otherwise I’m concerned that there will be low buy-in and the resentment between rural and urban communities will\n\n grow, which would be very counter-productive."

      "question_index": 1,
      "answer": "Net Zero Long-Lived Gases and Stabilised Short-Lived Gases - Long-lived gases to net zero by 2050 while also stabilising short-lived gases",
      "answer_index": 12,
      "notes": "It makes more sense to me that the different gases should be treated differently in law, since their sources and effects are very\n\n different. I’m concerned that a blanket approach may be chosen that will not ultimately be fair or effective, based on intuitions rather\n than science."
