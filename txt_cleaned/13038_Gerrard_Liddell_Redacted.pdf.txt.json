      "notes": "NZs high transport emissions are an indictment. The NZTA Land Transport studies establish that road transport is paying less than\n56% of its costs. This figure ignores the carbon cost, the QUALY cost and most importanly the road corridor costs. The moment\nsomeone steps into their car, their transport weight goes up by at least an order of magntude (ten times). A Nissan leaf weighs a\n\nmassive 1.5 tonnes. In addition they presume the right to the space of many cyclists or pedestrians. Worst vehicles presume they\nhave paid for a road corridor they can use for their exclusive safety, reluctant to truly share the corridor they have never paid for (they\n\nonly share part of the pavement costs with rate and tax payers). Until we start pricing for weight and space (congestion) so electric\nbikes, quadcycles and active transport have a true cost advantage, we will never get a rational efficient transport system. This will\n\ncontinue to distort our development with millions of tonnes of concrete and construction poured into unserviceable locations.\nSavings in emissions could be made from changing from white flight tribal education with 40% of peak hour traffic being children\ndriven to school at the cost of their health, development and safety of other children using active transport. This cut emissions far\n\nmore and far quicker than slow transition to heavy EV vehicles. It would cost nothing, indeed it would just save money. Leading\nsociety in these directions should be they primary role of the commission."
