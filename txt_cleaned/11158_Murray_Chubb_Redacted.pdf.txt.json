      "notes": "I believe the Climate Change Commission is ONLY an advisory role. Until all governing bodies can agree on how the greenhouse gas\n\n emissions impact the environment there should be no legistation set."

      "answer_index": 13,
      "notes": "Methane is part of a biological cyclical process. The net effect on the concentration of methane is none - it is an important cycle to\n create \"life\" it does not \"cook\" the planet as we are led to believe. Nitrogen (not the synthetic man made crap) cycle is our vital link to\n\n our life cycle and food production, with this we have no need to reduce NO2. Carbon emissions sourced from CO2 need to be\n reduced whereas carbon emissions sourced from methane do not need to reduce at all."

      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "The irony of the carbon units trading is laughable - we sell our coal to China and they continue to use this fuel - what has the world\n\n gained by this???? We should continue to use our own coal and gas which we extract ethically. Renewal energy such as wind turbines\n still hold major issues, how to dispose of the batteries and turbines as I understand they only have approx a 20yr life span, we still\n have a long way to go before we can stand alone on renewable energy."

If this is the case how will land owners survive, what will their income be derived from?\n\nIf the trees are to be plantations for harvesting will the Government be held accountable for the forseable disasters that will occur\nthrough the slash left after harvesting (we are already experiencing the disasters) and this will only get worse if the scientists\n\npredictions with climate change are correct with more adverse weather patterns."
