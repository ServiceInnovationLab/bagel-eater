A recent article in the N.Z Herald showed that scientist/s believe man's\ncontribution to the global warming is only about .3% !!!! The causative agent ( according to the article )being the natural degradation\n\nof the oceans' vegetation. Another N.Z Herald article showed the global warming calculations are clearly reliant on various computer\nmodels showing some of the data or perhaps much or most of it is conjecture!Clearly trying to save a planet that science and\n\nevidence shows can't be saved by spending a fortune and punishing taxpayers along the way is not wise."
