      "notes": "The Government should accept that 'Climate Change' is a massive con to extort mega money from gullible nations and people. We\n have been given alarmist statistics for years now, initially as global cooling, which when that didn't pan out, became global warming,\n\n then morphed into anthropogenic climate change when that became inconvenient. Climate, is and always will be cyclical, change is\n part of the natural process/"
