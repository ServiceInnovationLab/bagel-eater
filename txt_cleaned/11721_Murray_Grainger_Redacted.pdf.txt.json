Are you seriously suggesting that Maori have a developed tradition of dealing\nwith climate change? If Maori understand everything visible and invisible existing in the universe then they will know the answer to\nclimate change. Job done! • business competitiveness - there will not be any business competitiveness if emission targets are\n\nimposed."

      "notes": "Before any attempt is made to address climate \"change\" we must, as a nation, agree on what exactly the climate is that we do not\n\nwant to change and in which direction it should not change? If we stop all the CO2 and somehow get the ‘climate’ back to the pre-\nindustrial 1800s is that not changing the climate (back)? Or is climate change only bad if it is in a certain direction (warmer)? If this is\n\nthe case, why don’t those who propose climate change commissions and so forth be honest and say so? Surely it is not because\nthere hasn’t been any warming for the last twenty years or so? And would, say, one degree of warming in one climate zone, say\n\nSouthland, have the same effect as one degree of warming in another, say Northland? If climate ‘change’ is bad, how do you know if\nyou are stopping climate change unless a baseline ‘acceptable climate’ has first been agreed upon? Without the complete data on\nthis agreed perfect climate that we do not want to change any decisions made are going to be flawed. If you don’t know your starting\n\npoint, you have no idea if you are making progress towards your destination. Once we agree on the description of New Zealand’s\nideal climate from which any change is unacceptable, we can start some sensible discussions."
