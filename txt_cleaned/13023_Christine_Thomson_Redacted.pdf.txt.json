      "notes": "Climate change is called a Wicked problem for a reason. The very thing that we are so reliant on is now the thing that threatens the\nwellbeing and even survival of many of earth's citizens. Fossil,fuels are interwoven into the fabric of the economy. The climatic\n\nchanges are following the predicted pattern, and this doesn't bode well. Many of the public and businesses are still apathetic.\nLegislation is essential. There are growing examples of how this works well in other responsible countries. The equally biggest\nchallenge as I see it, is educating and inspiring the population toward action, so they are behind this goal in action and word. For 6\n\nyears I have voluntarily been hosting panel discussions and documentaries to engage the public on climate change, and there is very\nlittle traction. The action is mostly coming from the small number of already informed people. There are known reasons for this, and\n\naddressing these reasons is ESSENTIAL. It is essential that community engagement and communications are robust. This has been a\nhuge shortfall in climate change publicity so far. There is very little available for the average person (especially those not university\neducated) to know how they can wok out a carbon footprint, which lifestyle changes will create the most reduction in their emissions\n\netc. I am well versed in Climate issues and it's hard even for myself. International travel is one of the greatest culprits but I know lots of\npeople who travel and have no idea of the significance. Equally there are known barriers to people taking action on climate change\n\nand these need to be directly addressed with input from people with psychological, educational and marketing expertise . The sense\nof despair people experience with the enormity of the issue causes people to switch off. The effects seem distant and aren't yet very\ntangible, but sadly it will be too late once they are. People influenced by others who don't appear to be taking action, or they believe\n\nit's all up to the government. They also hope that technology will save us. Research on this is easily available and must be heeded.\nBack to Legislation. The Westpac bank recent report concluded that it will never be easy to introduce strategies to reduce carbon\n\nemissions, but more importantly it is easier, and more economical to start now rather than wait. People and businesses, left to their\nown devices are known to act slowly over threats of a distant nature. Well considered legislation like a Zero Carbon Act is an essential\n\nfirst step and lever to ensure New Zealand businesses and families meet their targets for reducing carbon emissions."
