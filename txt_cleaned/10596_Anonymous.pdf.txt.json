      "notes": "Dear Minister I strongly support the passing of a legally binding climate law and the immediate creation of a Zero Carbon Act. I believe\nin a net-zero carbon future for New Zealand. We need to make dramatic reductions in our emissions to keep climate change limited\n\nto 1.5 degrees and protect our native flora and fauna, our societies and our important infrastructures for ourselves and future\ngenerations. We must act now to make a positive difference. The key things I support in a Zero Carbon Act are: • an Act that follows\nthe climate science by covering all gases across all sectors • a target of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040/45 • an Act\n\nthat targets the emissions from transport, industrial activity, agriculture and all other sources • an Act that includes emissions\nbudgets that should be at least as important as fiscal budgets, with plans set by the Government to achieve these budgets • an\n\nindependent Climate Change Commission of experts to monitor emissions and give advice to the Government to keep New Zealand\non track for its emissions reduction goals. I support Zero Carbon Act legislation that establishes the goal of limiting warming to 1.5\n\ndegrees. We should not settle for 2 degrees warming. Any higher than 1.5 degrees would result in devastating impacts for Pacific\nIsland states and significant extinctions. That is not acceptable. To give us the best possibility of achieving no more than 1.5 degrees\nwarming by the end of the century, we must start making rapid cuts in all greenhouse gas emissions now. I support a net-zero target\n\nof 2040/45, with the majority of cuts occurring over the next decade. I support all greenhouse gases being included in the law,\nconsistent with international climate frameworks. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) clearly states that methane\n\nreduction is critical to succeeding in tackling climate change. Our climate law must include all greenhouse gases, including those\nfrom our biggest emitting sector - the agricultural sector. I support setting a gross emissions reduction target as well as a net\n\nemissions reduction target. We cannot rely on planting trees alone to offset our emissions. We must seek to decarbonise our\nindustry and transport systems. As the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment stated in their submission to the Productivity\n\nCommission, June 2018, page 4: “Each tonne of emissions offset by forestry is a tonne not reduced at source. Relying too heavily on\nforestry could lead to continued high levels of gross emissions. Pressure to reduce these after 2050 could entail a more costly and\ndisruptive transition than a deeper transition commenced earlier.” I support the ‘firewall’ principle that New Zealand’s targets must be\n\nachieved by actual reductions in our own domestic emissions and not through the purchase of overseas carbon credits or an over-\nreliance on forests as carbon sinks. I support setting legally binding climate budgets that are set at a bare-minimum ambition, which\n\nmust be achieved or bettered by government within the prescribed timeframes. While budgets should be binding, policy\nrecommendations from the Commission should be just that – recommendations. The world needs pathways to transformational\n\nchange if we are to avoid catastrophic climate change. This is the scale of the challenge. The science is clear: the only way we can\nsucceed is with big ambition. New Zealand must be bold and pass strong laws for the sake of our precious earth and future\ngenerations. I support the establishment of a Climate Change Commission. The commission’s role should include: • devising binding\n\nclimate budgets • identifying the level of reduction for each form of greenhouse gas (long-lived and short-lived) • monitoring\nadherence to the set ‘firewall’ • monitoring progress towards our targets • monitoring cumulative emissions • advising on adaptation.\n\nThe Climate Change Commission should provide advice to the New Zealand government. To ensure transparency and accountability,\nI support the Government being required to table all reports from the Climate Change Commission to Parliament. I support the\n\nGovernment preparing a National Climate Risk Assessment. The Government must be required to produce an Adaption Programme\nto address the climate risks identified in the National Climate Risk Assessment.\n\n\n\n\n You have elected to withhold your personal details from publication."
