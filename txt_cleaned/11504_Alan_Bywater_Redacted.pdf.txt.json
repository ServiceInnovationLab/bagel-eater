      "answer": "Net Zero Emissions - Net zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050",
      "answer_index": 1,
      "notes": "I think we should aim for an ambitious target. That way if we don't make it to achieve the target exactly we will still have achieved a\n great deal."

      "question": "3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?",
      "question_index": 2,
      "answer": "Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards",
      "answer_index": 2,

      "answer": "Yes",
      "answer_index": 3,
      "notes": "But only in very extreme circumstances. It should not be possible for Governments to change the target for political expediency\n reasons."

      "answer": "Yes",
      "answer_index": 3,

      "answer": "Yes",
      "answer_index": 3,
      "notes": "It is important to have commissioners with expertise in climate change adaptation. Commissioners who have good local government\nexperience will also be important as often local government will be at the sharp end of adaptation decisions at a local level."

      "answer": "Yes",
      "answer_index": 3,
      "notes": "I believe the national climate change risk assessment and the requirement to develop a National Adaptation Plan are very important\nparts of this proposed legislation. It is important that Government sets the overall direction for the National Adaptation Plan but work\n\nclosely with local government, local communities and organisations to both create and implement the Plan."

      "question": "16. Should we explore setting up a targeted adaptation reporting power that could see some organisations share information on their exposure to climate change risks?",
      "question_index": 14,
      "answer": "Yes",
      "answer_index": 3,
      "notes": "However, the costs and administrative burden of doing so should be minimised. It is important that the Commission and the\n\nGovernment have a good picture of what is happening in the adaptation space across a range of organisations. The reporting\nrequirement should be integrated with existing reporting requirements e.g. Annual Reports rather than creating an additional\n\nreporting process."
