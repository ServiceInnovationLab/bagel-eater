      "notes": "I oppose the Bill. However the scientific method allows for challenges to hypotheses. Cannot prove an hypothesis, in this case, that\n\n significant climate change is occurring, but evidence that disproves the hypothesis is considered and the hypothesis is then rejected\n or modified. Scientific endeavour always allows for challenges, flexibility and modification of hypotheses in the face of evidence"

Insects are regulated by temperature so are ideal indicators of climate change. I can report that since its arrival\nin 1999 the Tropical grass webworm, Herpetogramma licasisalis, has not spread further south of Kaitaia, despite its food source\n\nkikuyu grass extending throughout Northland as far south as coastal Horowhenua. As its name suggests this is a tropical insect\nwhich is at the limit of its distribution in New Zealand north of Kaitaia. In 20 years climate has not warmed sufficiently for this insect to\n\nextend its range (Dymock et al. 2009. Proceedings of the New Zealand Grasslands Association 71: 25-30). I am currently working on\ndistribution changes of a range of key insect indicators of climate change."
