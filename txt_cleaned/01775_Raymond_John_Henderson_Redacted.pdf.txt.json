Globalization with endemic Asian/African overpopulation, increasing Asian emission of greenhouse gases, Asian\n\ndeforestation and Asian recolonization of many countries on Earth. 3. Agricultural emissions so: a) impose an environment tax on\nnitrogen-based fertilizers; b) impose a carbon tax on GHG emissions from livestock; 4. Fossil fuels for transport and industrial\n\npurposes (deregister petrol and diesel vehicles by 2050); To make change and reduce greenhouse gases options are to: 5. STOP\nIMMIGRATION; 6. Sequester more carbon with reforestation of marginal lands; 7. Update carbon credit system to forest owners; 8.\nIncrease renewable sources of energy (e.g., new high dams on the Clutha?); 9. Ensure most forms of energy are electric by 2050;\n\n10. Place price controls on electricity (if NZ is to remain competitive our electricity can’t be twice the price of everyone else; it was\n11c/unit in 1975 but now 28c per unit); 11. Provide seeding finance to establish synthetic milk and synthetic meat factories; 12.\n\nTransition from pastoral farming to horticulture; and, 13. Impose road haulage restrictions on the distances that goods can be shifted\nwith trucks powered by fossil fuels."

New Zealand has made calamatious decisions as a\nconsequence. Democracy is 'government by the people' and this process must be respected. My fear with the commision is we will\n\nget increased executive powers that drive us towards unsustainable goals. In New Zealand I look at things like immigration,\ninfrastructure deficits, increased consumption taxes and social impoverishment, none of which is sustainable, but they are the\n\noutcomes of executive decisions made despite public opposition to concepts like globalisation, neo-liberalism, consumption taxes,\nimmigration etc. made by ideologs.

      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "If we look at the 'Paris Agreement' and targets of 11% below 1990 levels and look at population growth the logistics of reducing\ngreenhouse gases become exceedingly difficult. In 1990 New Zealand had a population of 3.414 million, today our population at 4.76\n\nmillion is 39% higher. We had to be 11% below 1990 levels so effectively at this moment in time every person that was alive in 1990\nshould have a carbon footprint 50% smaller than they did back then. But our Paris target was for 2030 (estimated population 5.2\n\nmillion or a 9.5% increase); so by then every person that was alive in 1990 must have a carbon footprint 60% smaller than it was back\nthen. If we continue this extrapolation to 2050 then the carbon footprint of someone alive in 1990 needs to be 78% smaller than it\n\nwas back then. This is totally unrealistic; the only logical way to stem greenhouse gas emissions is to STOP population growth and\nmore importantly STOP IMMIGRATION. Global warming is an international problem caused by globalisation; one where the major\nemitters are the Asian block of countries (China, India, Japan, Korea, Indonesia, Phillipines, etc) whom emitt >50% of all greenhouse\n\ngases. International pressure either through diplomacy (foreign affairs) or trade (an embargo on goods with high carbon footprints)\nmust be imposed to arrest the growth in greenhouse gases from China and India especially. We MUST REDUCE ELECTRICITY PRICES\n\nif New Zealand is going to remain competitive. The free-market model for electricity implemented by the last 2 National governments\nhas resulted in New Zealand having some of the most expensive electricity prices in the world. In India electricity is 5-6.5c per unit, in\n\nChina 8c per unit, in Canada 10c per unit, in the USA 12c per unit, in the UK 20c per unit; but here in NZ it is 28c per unit. When we\nare reliant on electricity for energy and transport we cannot afford to pay the current price. Quite simple we will not be competitive in\ninternational markets. We must transition away from current agricultural commodities to horticulture. This should start now with\n\nseeding finance for synthetic milk and synthetic meat production. Agriculture must pay for high livestock emissions which will\nenhance the rate of change. A tax on nitrogen-based fertilizers must be imposed to reduce nitrates in surface and groundwater; and\n\nreduce emissions of nitrous oxide. One of the principle risks is we are locked into Keynesian economics which is a paradigm requiring\ncompounded growth in all economic indicators to provide a workable framework for our economy. How can we have an economy with\ncompounded growth year on year, when in fact we require compounded recessions year on year in our carbon footprint? How can\n\ncompounded human impacts on ecosystems continue year on year when we want compounded growth of biodiversity to sequester\ncarbon? How can compounded population growth continue year on year when the overshoot in world population currently exceeds 2\n\nbillion people and overshoot in the New Zealand population is almost 1 million people? What is the model for sustainability, because it\ncertainly isn’t what we have got at the minute."
