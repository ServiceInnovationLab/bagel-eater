      "question_index": 0,
      "answer": null,
      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "I don't believe in a zero emissions target. CO2 is necessary for our food chain and a rise in temperature would enable more areas to\n\n grow food. A drop in temperature could be more catastrophic."

      "answer": null,
      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "A much better target would be to work towards tackling real pollution problems, (like effluent on the beaches every time it rains in\n Auckland). If that can't be fixed, you really think you can solve non existent man made climate change?"

      "answer": null,
      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "Use our own coal and oil and gas, produced more ethically than other countries, rather than having to import these from these dirty\n producing countries. We have no answer at this stage to produce enough renewable energy to fill our ever increasing demands and\n how are we going to dispose of the existing wind turbines and batteries when they have come to the end of their lives?"

      "answer": null,
      "answer_index": 5,

      "answer": null,
      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "First of all we need to decide whose climate change science we are following as this whole initial question of the existence of man\n\n made climate change has not been proven. Many models of doom and gloom have not come to fruition. Nothing should be put in\nplace until this has been settled."

Plenty of people out there who will be prepared to be \"desirable expertise\" if it means they get to keep their\nnose in the trough for a bit longer."
