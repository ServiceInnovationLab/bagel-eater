      "question_index": 0,
      "answer": null,
      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "I think that the Government should set a goal to reduce emissions at some point in the future when major emitters are taking\n effective steps to reduce their emissions profile. I don't accept that a new target is desirable or necessary. New Zealand is\n\n responsible for a tiny proportion of global emissions and, because of the make up of its emissions profile and industries, any attempt\n to significantly reduce emissions runs the risk of causing undue damage to the country's economy. I do not think that this risk is\n\n warranted to \"set an example\" to the rest of the world. Until the \"big three\" emitters demonstrate their commitment to reducing\n emissions by concrete actions anything other minor emitters do is simply irrelevant."

      "question_index": 2,
      "answer": null,
      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "By reducing domestic emissions where this will not have an adverse effect on economic activity, for example, where new technology\n or technological improvements result in lower emissions in the process of improving operating efficiency or as a by-product of new\n processes. For example, new petrol-powered motor cars produce much less carbon dioxide per kilometre of use than cars produced\n\n even a few years ago, thus reducing New Zealand's net emissions anyway."

      "question": "4. Should the Zero Carbon Bill allow the 2050 target to be revised if circumstances change?",
      "question_index": 3,
      "answer": "Yes",
      "answer_index": 3,
      "notes": "Most definitely. Climate change is a natural process that has always and will always occur. What this Bill is aimed at is the additional\n effect caused by human activity. I have seen no credible evidence that any of the predictions arising from any of the global warming or\n climate change models have actually come to pass. Thirty years ago climate scientists were warning that in thirty years time we would\n\n be experiencing a mini-ice age, now they are predicting the opposite. The Minister himself accepts that the economic modelling\n cannot be accurate over a 30-year time frame (page 29 of the Discussion Document) but seems oblivious of the fact that the same\n\n uncertainty must apply to any model where there is not a defined, proven and reproducible mathematical formula for predicting the\n effects of any particular action. The climate is an incredibly complex chaotic system that we do not understand at any level. It seems\n to be impossible to predict the weather, as opposed to climate, with any degree of accuracy over anything more than 24 hours. Nor\n\n can we predict the occurrence of effects of natural phenomena such as volcanic eruptions that will result in large quantities of carbon\n dioxide and other \"greenhouse gases\" being added to the atmosphere, together with the formation of gigantic ash clouds that will\n\n inevitably affect the weather patterns. Circumstances will inevitably change, other countries may or may not come good on their\n promises, unexpected factors or events may make it impossible for New Zealand to meet whatever targets are set and those targets\n must be flexible."

      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "The Government should be able to alter all three budgets as and when necessary.

      "answer": "No",
      "answer_index": 8,
      "notes": "Both sides of the scientific debate and knowledge about climate change must be taken into account as must technology but\neconomic, fiscal and social factors must be paramount.

      "question_index": 8,
      "answer": null,
      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "The most important issues for the Government to consider are the social, economic and fiscal implications of the plans. The Minister\nhas accepted that additional benefits will be necessary to minimise the effects on certain sectors of the population. This is a critical\n\npart of the planning and by no means the easiest. The poorest members of society are likely to be hard hit and targeting financial\nhelp at them will be relatively easy. The difficult segments of society will be those who are on the cusp of any benefits or just above\n\nthe thresholds as these are always the ones who suffer disproportionately as increases in income are often outweighed by\nreductions in benefit."

      "answer": "No",
      "answer_index": 8,
      "notes": "I believe that it is imperative that the Climate Change Commission has no executive powers whatsoever, its role must be purely\n\nadvisory and another independent body must be charged with the monitoring. The Commission could SUGGEST what it believes to\nbe appropriate levels and compositions for emissions budgets but the Government must decide. The Commission must seek\nindependent scientific advice rather than being the source of such advice. Using this advice, the Commission could suggest the\n\nextent to which New Zealand should take account of any international emissions changes in setting domestic targets."

      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "I do not think that the Commission should have any role in policy setting in relation to the ETS. I believe that the ETS needs a\nfundamental rethink and restructuring to ensure that it does not adversely affect any important sectors of the New Zealand economy.\n\nAll decisions must be taken by Government after full consultation with interested parties, both industry and the public."

      "question_index": 11,
      "answer": null,
      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "I do not think that a Commission of a manageable and sensible size can hope to encompass all of the necessary expertise within its\nmembers and it will be more appropriate for the Commission members to be experienced in policy decision-making and\n\nimplementation in order that they will have a good appreciation of the challenges inherent in this. The first and most important\ncharacteristic that members of the Commission must have is open-mindedness. The second is the ability to recognise when it is\nnecessary to seek expert advice and scientific input. After that, essential expertise must include the social impacts of economic\n\nchange and policy; awareness of the potential impacts on local government and the ability of local government to respond, with or\nwithout help from central government; risk management."

      "question_index": 12,
      "answer": "No",
      "answer_index": 8,
      "notes": "A fundamental part of any government's responsibility must be to take account of the costs of adapting to changed circumstances,\nwhether this be, for example, natural disasters such as earthquakes, coastal erosion as a natural process or the inevitable effects of\n\nhaving permitted housing to be built on a flood plain. It matters not what has caused these changes and it is futile to try and predict\nwhat changes are likely as the majority will be truly unpredictable."

      "answer": null,
      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "As per the previous question, the Government must assist local communities to build resilience against any natural disaster not just\n\n\"climate change\". Sea level rise may or may not occur, severe weather events may or may not become more frequent, earthquakes\nmay or may not happen, but planning should take place so that communities can be assured of support if they are affected by any\nunexpected event."

      "answer_index": 5,

      "notes": "The most important principle that medical doctors are taught is \"Do no harm\". I believe that this should be the over-riding principle for\nthe Bill in relation to the New Zealand economy. New Zealand's contribution to global emissions is miniscule and hamstringing the\ncountry's economy in an attempt to make futile changes is, in my opinion, unforgivable. I do not wish my name or email address to be\n\npublished on the Ministry for the Environment’s website, in any release to the public under the Official Information Act or in any\nsummary of submissions that the Ministry may publish."
