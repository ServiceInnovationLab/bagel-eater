      "answer_index": 12,
      "notes": "It is important to take a science-based approach to ensure our emission reduction efforts are as impactful as possible. This means\n\n recognising the difference between long-lived greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide) and short-lived\n greenhouse gases (such as methane). We call this the “two baskets” approach. Applying a two baskets approach to achieve a net\n zero 2050 all gases target would mean: •Combining long-lived gas reductions with carbon sinks (through forestry and carbon\n\n sequestration in soil) to achieve negative long-lived emissions by 2050; and •Reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels."

      "answer_index": 7,
      "notes": "The Zero Carbon Act should be met through domestic emissions reductions only. We call this the “firewall principle”. Relying on\n international carbon credits (even if the credits have integrity) creates uncertainty about what reductions need to be achieved in New\n\n Zealand. It also means we are investing in other countries’ low emission transitions, rather than our own."

      "answer": "Yes",
      "answer_index": 3,
      "notes": "The 2050 target should only be revised in exceptional circumstances. The purpose of the Zero Carbon Act is to provide\n accountability, certainty and flexibility. It will provide accountability and certainty by setting clear, legally-binding emission reduction\n targets. It will retain flexibility by permitting different governments to use different policies to meet these targets, in response to\n\n changing circumstances and new technology. Despite the importance of accountability and certainty, there are some situations\n where it is appropriate to change the 2050 target. For example, if there is a significant change in scientific knowledge or international\n\n law (such as the Paris Agreement becoming more ambitious). Any revision should require input from the Climate Commission and\n approval by Parliament. Generation Zero does not support being able to revise the 2050 target in response to “economic changes”.\n This would create uncertainty, which means more econ"

      "notes": "Yes. A weakness of the UK Climate Change Act, on which the Zero Carbon Act is based, is that the UK Act does not set clear\ntimeframes for the government to make policy plans to meet future emission budgets (which are set 10-15 years in advance).\n\nGeneration Zero supports the Zero Carbon Act having a strict time frame for setting out policy plans. This time frame should be 6\nmonths after an emission budget has been set."
