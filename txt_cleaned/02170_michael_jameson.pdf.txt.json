      "notes": "I do not believe that the science that says CO2 is the sole source of Global Warming. Indeed has the IPCC or the Paris Accord\n specified what the density of CO2 in the atmosphere should be?Trying to set a country's target without a global target makes no\n sense at all, particularly when any of the reductions being proposed are going to reduce New Zealand's GDP by up to 22%."

      "notes": "The target should be set ONLY AFTER it is clearly established that CO2 density.is clearly linked to hemispherical temperature control;\n the sensitivity of hemispherical temperature in relation to CO2 density; and the density that is to be attained to maintain\n temperatures, is specified and internationally accepted. It is difficult to believe however that the rise in CO2 density between 1958\n\n and 2017 [310 ppm to 400 ppm], a .00009% increase, is solely responsible for the temperature rises."

      "notes": "Who, apart from the Minister and his entourage, says New Zealand should have an established target of zero emissions?

This seems to be Marxist wealth redistribution in disguise."

An\nAustralian study, based on some 69 measuring points around the Australian coastline, estimates a 3 - 5 cm rise this century. The\n\nMinister wishes to incorporate agriculture emissions into the mix because of methane and CO2 release.

      "notes": "I thought that there was supposed to a DISCUSSION, but in fact we are required to accept the Minister is correct - CO2 Emissions are\nthe cause of all our problems - and only discuss how far are we prepared to go to restrict its release to atmosphere. I think the\n\ndiscussion needs to start a few steps earlier before we start to close down our economy!!!!!. I also think that all citizens need be\ngiven real data, not subjective ideology and alarmist statements, so that they are able to endorse or discard the shrinking of our\n\neconomy by way of binding referendum. At the very least, they need to have a clear picture of what life in our country will look like with\nthe withdrawal hydrocarbons [the most cost efficient and concentrated source of energy currently available to humanity], and a clear\n\nplan on how this energy source will be replaced given that: 1. wind and solar energy require more energy and resources to\nmanufacture than they are able to generate [ask Germany and Scandinavia who have said that these scources cannot replace\nhydrocarbons]; 2. Nuclear energy is currently denied to New Zealanders by current legislation; and 3. Hydro energy resources are all-\n\nbut at maximum capacity. How any Government could deliberately commit its population to a reducing standard of living is difficult to\ncomprehend. It is time to STOP treating CO2 as a pollutant - it is not. ASK ANY PLANT!"
