      "notes": "I'm very disappointed that there is no reference to Soil Carbon in this paper. While Carbon emissions from soil pale beside fossil fuel\nemissions they are a significant contributor, with estimates ranging from 40-500 billion tons of carbon lost during the industrial\n\nrevolution period. The loss of soil carbon also contributes to water pollution, loss of nutrient and water holding capacity of soils,\n(Reduced yields and increased droughts.) and increases flood damage during heavy rain events. (Again through a lack of water\n\nholding capacity.) The science is strong that the following factors cause loss of soil carbon. 1. Cultivation and erosion. 2. Overgrazing.\n3. Loss of fertility. 4. Forestation. 5. Over application of synthetic nitrogen fertiliser. The exciting thing about soil carbon is that by good\nmanagement it can easily be increased and governments around the world are recognising this. This increase can be easily\n\nmeasured and a robust measuring system down to a metre's depth has been successfully developed in New Zealand by Peter Floyd.\nNo country is better placed to increase soil carbon than New Zealand because of our extensive pastoral grazing land, and proper\n\nmanagement of this soil carbon will easily enable us to meet a zero net carbon emission target well ahead of the targets set out in\nthis bill. To achieve this we need a government that takes Climate Change and the Environment seriously, we need individual farmers\n\nto be incentivised to increase their soil carbon by access to carbon credits for soil carbon, and we need a robust measuring system\nsuch as Peter Floyd has developed to be adopted as a national standard for recognition of soil carbon at an individual farm level."
