      "notes": "Native forests should be included as well as pre 1990 forests planted that won't be harvested. We live on a farm with significant native\n\n bush. Over the years while others have cleared bush our family has preserved it - there is so much bush on our farm that we have\n very little room for new plantings. There should be some credit for this ongoing conservation work and commitment to offsetting our\n on farm emissions. Likewise, we market the food products from our farm - it will become more and more important for consumers to\n\n have the ability to choose products from 'carbon neutral' or positive producers. Our stock numbers are low, we don't irrigate, our\nfertiliser use is very limited - however, because we don't have the space for new plantings - technically we will sit next to more heavy\n\npolluters and gives an unfair impression of the nature of our business and our commitment to reducing greenhouse gas levels. If the\ngovernment is to go beyond its current Paris commitments, I encourage the government to also take a more flexible approach to\n\nmeasuring emissions offsets, that are genuinely sequestering carbon. The international rules do allow alternative metrics. As a\nbusiness and a family we care deeply about the environment and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Historically we have done our\n\nbit and want to continue our efforts in this area and do even better. Please help us to achieve our goals."
