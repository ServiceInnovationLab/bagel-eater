      "notes": "You need to work with science based community, including a strong input from the Agricultural sector. The ramifications of planting\n\n pines all over our regions has not been thought through, look at Tolaga Bay. It will mean rural communities will suffer (most of the\n forestry workers live in Gisborne, NOT from the coast). The following comment taken from the executive summary is also laughable\n \"More forestry, in the right places, will improve the health of our birds, fish and plants. It will also improve water quality in our rivers and\n\n lakes and prevent erosion.\" Plantation forestry is not the panacea that everybody thinks it is. Plantation forestry needs to have strict\n controls put on it, just like farming, as the degradation of water ways and habitats can be just as bad, if not worse during the harvest\n\n time. The soil is laid bare for 5-10 years before the next pine takes hold and gives cover. There is a lot of damage that occurs during\n that time. ALso, is their any research into the long term soil health after 2 or more rotations of pine forests? Are we creating vast,\n infertile, monocultural deserts? The question is out if forestry is as sustainable as it claims to be. We need to have more active land\n\n management from councils. It needs to be on a catchment basis, as every situation is different. And people who have experience in\n the agricultural and forestry fields must be involved and listened too, not just policy makers from the urban areas. This is extremely\n important as this could be an extremely positive move for everybody, if the right people are involved. We certainly do not need to\n\n widen the urban rural divide, which is fed by mis information and sound bites from the media. Also, the Government need to consider\nwhat already exists in terms of vegetation and trees that are on farms, do the farmers that have been 'good environmentalists' that\n\nhave retained native vegetation and planted etc, get punished, whilst a dairy farmer that has previously clear felled their land get\ncarbon credits if they plant after the set date? A farmer who has actively retained native vegetation should be able to use that to\n\noffset their carbon emissions."

      "notes": "What ever is set, it must be based on science, please refer to your document. Any target we set needs to be informed by the best\n\navailable climate change science. Nearly half of New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture, which means we\nneed to pay particular attention to the scientific impact of short-lived gases like methane, which dominate agriculture’s emissions.\n\nSHORT-LIVED AND LONG-LIVED GASES Short-lived gases like methane decay relatively rapidly in the atmosphere. They last for\ndecades rather than centuries. This means global temperatures can be stabilised without necessarily reducing emissions of these\ngases to zero. We also have an opportunity to lower the impact even further by not only stabilising but also, where possible, reducing\n\nshort-lived gases from our economy. Long-lived gases like carbon dioxide either need to reduce entirely to zero or at least to the\npoint where emissions can be balanced out by an equal amount of removals."
