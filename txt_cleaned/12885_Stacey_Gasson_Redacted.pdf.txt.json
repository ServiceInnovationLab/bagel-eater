      "notes": "It is important that all greenhouse gases be reduced to net zero. While methane is a short-lived gas, it has contributed most to the\n increase in NZ's GHG emissions since 1990 and is of particular concern as it is roughly 30 times more potent than CO2 as a GHG."

      "question": "3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?",
      "question_index": 2,
      "answer": "Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)",
      "answer_index": 7,
      "notes": "Purchasing emissions reductions from overseas is not a good option as it reduces the sense of urgency with which we need to\n\n approach climate change - i.e. the risk is that business will continue largely as usual, relying on overseas offsets. In the medium to\n longer term this will be an increasingly risky and expensive path as we compete with other nations and industries for these carbon\n\n units. For example, the 2016 Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) seeks to ensure that future\n growth in international flights will be carbon-neutral. From 2020, airlines that comply with the scheme will be required to offset any\n increase in their emissions. Based on historical improvements in aviation efficiency, further gains are predicted at ~1.5% p.a. over the\n\n next 20 years, but this scenario relies on continued steady efficiency gains and game-changing technological solutions. In reality,\n technology is thought to be reaching its technical and physical limits as annual efficiency gains fall to ~1%; gains in efficiency will be\n offset by growth in emissions as passenger numbers climb; and most of the proposed 'solutions' of the past 20 years have been\n\n proven unworkable, overstated, or physically impossible. The net result is predicted to be a 135% increase in global tourism\n emissions over the 2005 baseline by 2035. It is likely then that CORSIA will fail to curb aviation emission growth in a meaningful way\n\n and instead increase demand for carbon credits. New Zealand is currently expected to spend $14 billion to offset current GHG\n emissions, but could well find themselves exposed in the face of a spike in global carbon prices."

      "answer": "Yes",
      "answer_index": 3,
      "notes": "Yes, if stronger action is found to be necessary. A hallmark of climate change is the uncertainty that surrounds it and the rate at which\n the science is developing, due to its complexity. Scientists are constantly making new discoveries in this area. For example, a new\n\n study says emissions of CO2 and methane from wetlands and thawing permafrost as the climate warms could cut the “carbon\n budget” for the Paris Agreement temperature limits by around five years, or 20%, if we are to meet the 1.5 or 2 degree limits\n\n (https://www.carbonbrief.org/permafrost-wetland-emissions-could-cut-1-5c-carbon-budget-five-years). However, if the target were to\n be revised because other countries have reduced their emissions by more than their 'share', I would be strongly opposed."

This will create a\n\n‘firewall’ between domestic action and international carbon trading, to ensure our own zero carbon transition is on track. The Two\nBaskets Approach The Act will set separate targets and pathways for long-lived greenhouse gases (mainly carbon dioxide and nitrous\n\noxide) and short-lived greenhouse gases (mainly methane). Long-lived gases must go to net zero by 2050 or sooner (accounting for\ncarbon sinks). Short-lived gases must be significantly reduced to sustainable levels, but not zero."
