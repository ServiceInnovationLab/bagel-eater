      "notes": "It is worth noting that animal agriculture plays a significant role in Methane production. Emphasising a shift away from farmed animals\n\n to plant based proteins (high quality lentil/pea crops) could play a role in reducing the GROSS emissions from farming overall. Also,\n there is much research to suggest that non-organic farming (even for plant crops) degrades soil when using chemical\n fertilisers:https://grist.org/article/2010-02-23-new-research-synthetic-nitrogen-destroys-soil-carbon-undermines/ Soil degradation\n\n then leads to Carbon loss to the atmosphere (increasing effects from draughts, less soil humus etc) and increases gross carbon\n emission. Without testing the soil OR having effective systems for carbon sequestration, farmers might be only speculating to say\n\n that they are increasing soil carbon - especially in chemically fertilised farms. Some possible solutions to reduce GROSS carbon: tax\n breaks for farmers a) not using chemical fertilisers, b) shifting from animal farming to plant crops like industrial hemp, lentils which\n feed the public the same and remove carbon from the atmosphere For NET carbon: systems like MyNoke compost application to\n\n farms can bring carbon back to the farm and reduce overall soil/carbon loss. Tax breaks could be given for farmers apply carbon with\n their field applications in both animal and plant farms where diesel/fossil fuel machinery emits carbon. Bear in mind that emissions\n should be calculated to prove carbon application is reducing their overall carbon footprint. ___ Aside from farms: other large scale\n\n industry needs to play its part also. Full large taxes on coal burners for Fonterra/hospitals may create incentive to choose\n electric/biodiesel burners. Putting the burden all on the individual (farmer or public) as the USA does will not bring down emissions\n\n enough - Large cooperations MUST be a part of the solution and reduce the GROSS emissions."
