      "notes": "As a psychologist, I am very interested in the secondary benefits of reducing emissions. Having lived overseas and moved back to NZ\n\n5 years ago, I have been very aware of how the car-centric society of NZ (particularly Auckland where I live) reduces the sense of\ncommunity and social connectedness, making it harder to meet one's neighbours, compared to places where people predominantly\n\nwalk, cycle or catch public transport. This negatively impacts people's mental health, sense of belonging and safety in their\ncommunity. With two small children, I would love to cycle to our local shops (which are too far to walk for preschoolers) but Auckland's\n\nlack of safe cycle infrastructure mean that I feel unsafe to do so. Cycling is wonderful for one's physical and mental health. It is crucial\nthat this legislation is ambitious and leads to action, not just more talk. NZ was once a progressive country. We can be that again."
