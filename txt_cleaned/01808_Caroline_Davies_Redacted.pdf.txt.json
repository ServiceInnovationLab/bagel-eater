Although I understand that you wish to make this massive shift wisely, and bring everybody on board, with\n\n the continuation and increase of carbon output into the atmosphere, and the fact that it has taken hundreds of years to get to this\n point, and we are seeing the kinds of impacts already affecting many people (including Insurance Companies) 2050 seems a long\n way away to begin any kind of serious and committed reversal. I feel the matter is urgent, and that is an understatement."
