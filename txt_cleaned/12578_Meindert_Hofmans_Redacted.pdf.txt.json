      "notes": "Yes, but only when more or less restrictive targets are agreed to in international agreements/accords - not because we have a\n change of goverment that places a lower value on the environment."

      "notes": "Advice alone is not sufficient e.g. Parliamentary Commissioner of the Environment. Many of the PCE reports have been ignored in the\n\n past so stronger mechanisms are required. Greater empahisis needs to be placed on the environment. Social and economic\n considerations are important but are less important than the health of our planet.i.e there no point in having a great economy when\n the environment can't support it."

      "notes": "National co-ordination on adaption is essential. This will remove some of the 'heat' from local authorities that are trying to do the right\nthing but are not being supported at a national level. It also means the issue is being adressed in a consistent manner whereas it\n\ncurrently depends on the political will and funding of each local authority."
