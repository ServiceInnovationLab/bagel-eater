      "answer": "The Government sets a goal to reach net zero emissions by the second half of the century and the Climate Change Commission advises on the specific target for the Government to set later",

      "answer": null,
      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "There are significant economic implications of setting in place legislation for plans and budgets. NZ will face: • slower rates of\n economic growth as a result of higher emissions prices and other transition policies • competitiveness issues in trade-exposed\n\n emissions-intensive industries • decline in output and jobs for higher emissions sectors"

      "answer": null,
      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "A Zero Carbon Bill will create a vast bureaucracy: A Climate Change Commission, ‘emissions budgets’, climate change adaptation\n\nplans, and emissions targets. Since livestock are carbon neutral, methane from agriculture should not be included in emissions\ntargets. Without methane, New Zealand would have one of the smallest greenhouse gas emissions profiles in the developed world.\n\nIn fact, no gases should be included in emissions targets, because just like the Emissions Trading Scheme, the proposed Zero\nCarbon Bill will create a costly nightmare of red tape and bureaucracy that will waste time and money, drag down the economy, and\n\ndestroy businesses and jobs – all for no benefit.\n\n\n\n You have elected to withhold your personal details from publication."
