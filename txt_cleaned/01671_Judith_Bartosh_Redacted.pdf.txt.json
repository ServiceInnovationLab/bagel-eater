What is the role of volcanic activity on land and under the ocean on climate change? How do we accurately measure\n worldwide temperature? None of these things are taken into account by the mathematical models used to predict climate change.\n\n This is why they are so inaccurate. Al Gore's Hockey stick is a good example. There was no warming from 2000-2014 but carbon\n dioxide levels continued to increase. Why?. We need good science before we spend billions of dollars."

Review the \"real science\" (not mathematical models based on very limited data and are continually\n\nproven wrong by new data) which seems to indicate carbon dioxide levels increase after global warming, not cause it. Have a plan for\nNZ to adapt to climate change, address pollution in the form of carbon particles and other gases in the air, swimmable rivers, clean\n\nharbours, plastics recycling, making NZ organic. Carbon dioxide is a colourless odourless gas we all breathe out, not a pollutant. New\nZealand should be leading the world in questioning the science."
