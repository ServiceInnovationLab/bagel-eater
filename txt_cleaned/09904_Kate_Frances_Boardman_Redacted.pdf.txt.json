      "notes": "I support the most ambitious target: reducing greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050, but would prefer a 2040 target if possible. I\n also support taking a science-based approach to ensure our efforts to reduce emissions are as impactful as possible: we should aim\n for negative levels of long-lived gases, while reducing short-lived gases to sustainable levels."

      "answer": "Domestic emissions reductions only (including from new forest planting)",
      "answer_index": 7,
      "notes": "The New Zealand net zero carbon target should be met by domestic reductions only. However New Zealand has international\n\n responsibilities and should be supporting and assisting in mitigation and adaptation in developing countries through mechanisms\n such as additional aid or perhaps purchasing carbon credits. Emphasis should be placed on reducing fossil fuel based emissions as\n\n soon as possible. The Zero Carbon Act should also provide a framework for transparency and accountability around New Zealand's\n international climate finance."

      "notes": "The Government’s policy plans to meet emission budgets should be comprehensive, fair, cost-effective, environmentally sustainable,\n\nand reflect a commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi. In setting plans to meet the emissions budgets, the government should be: •\nconsulting and working with Local Government to encourage them to mitigate and adapt to climate change • considering the relative\nconsumption emissions and other environmental impacts when weighing up mitigation and adaptation measures e.g. the emissions\n\ncost of producing electric cars overseas • considering the impact of its adaption and mitigation measures on other planetary\nboundaries i.e. biodiversity, nutrient pollution. • taking into account New Zealand’s contribution to international aviation and maritime\n\nemissions. • making sure they're based on the best science available • ensuring that they deliver fair outcomes for Kiwis • reflecting\nthe principle of a Just Transition for workers • honouring Te Tiriti o Waitangi • being environmentally sustainable, especially for New\n\nZealand's unique native plants and animals • maximising the impact of money spent and being cost-effective • encouraging\ninnovation • unlocking economic opportunities for New Zealanders, such as in renewable energy • honouring our international\ncommitments, including under the Paris Agreement • consulting people who may be economically affected, like farmers or\n\nbusinesses • consulting tangata whenua • consulting young people, who'll live to see more of the impact of climate change •\nconsulting communities already facing the physical impacts of climate change"

Monitoring our progress and holding the government account. It should not be a decision-making\nbody as it would lead to a lack of democratic accountability, it becoming a comprised watch dog and that it would not have the ability\n\nto implement comprehensive policy plans."

      "notes": "I am concerned about climate change and am very supportive of action to mitigate and adapt. As a Christian, I believe that we, as\npeople, have a call to care for God’s creation and to care for all peoples. This means supporting maximum ambition including meeting\nnet zero by 2040 domestically as well as supporting mitigation and adaption overseas especially with our Pacific neighbours. I am\n\nsupportive of taking action to limit warming to 1.5° C, since it has been those with privilege and opportunities who have made the\nmost out of fossil fuels, but it is those who have the least who will be the most disadvantaged by climate change. I believe that we\n\nneed to leave the world in a better place and I think that this bill will help with that."
