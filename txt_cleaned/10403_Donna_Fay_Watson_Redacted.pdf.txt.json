      "notes": "Globally, Climate Change is already having a huge impact, including measurable aspects such as extreme weather events. New\n\n Zealand is part of the global community, and although geographically we are a small country, our per capita emissions are high. This\n needs to change. I believe in a net-zero carbon future for New Zealand. In order to work with other nations to achieve a global-\n warming upper limit of 1.5degreesC, we need to be making dramatic reductions in our emissions, and we need to be doing this now,\n\n not in some vague future. A target for net-zero carbon emissions should be specified in legislation. Emissions from all sources,\n including transport, industrial activity and agriculture, should be included in the target. * I strongly support the immediate creation of a\n\n Zero Carbon Act. * I recommend that the Government sets a target of Net Zero emissions across all greenhouse gases by 2050 (or\n earlier if possible) * I recommend that New Zealand achieves its targets using domestic emissions reductions. A carbon Fee and\n Dividend system, which sets the price of emitting units of pollution, would encourage fairness, transparency and accountability. * I\n\n believe it is highly desirable that cross-party support for the target be secured, to avoid the risk of the target being changed for\n political expediency."
