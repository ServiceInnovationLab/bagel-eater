      "question_index": 0,
      "answer": null,
      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "Net zero emissions is probably unable to be achieved by any date if emissions includes carbon dioxide, the gas you are exhaling now.\n\n You really want us to all stop breathing?? Carbon dioxide is a required gas occurring naturally and is totally responsible for the ability of\n plants to grow. We are currently in a low CO2 phase - the atmosphere has contained far greater proportions of CO2 before humans\n were even around. CO2 generated by humans, by human activities or caused by any means has little, if any, effect on the climate of\n\n Earth."

      "question_index": 1,
      "answer": null,
      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "Setting any target for gases is both unnecessary and ridiculous. The carbon cycle and climate change have operated for billions of\n years - without these cycles we would not be able to live on Earth. Attempting to stop these cycles by setting targets is about as\n\n credible as stopping the Earth rotating, and equally dangerous to all life on Earthg."

      "notes": "If NZ sets zero CO2 production targets, where will the forest plantings get their CO2 to grow? Sequestration of carbon dioxide is a\n mirage - it all depends on time. You are trying to interfere with natural cycles which have served Earth well for billions of years with little\n\n understanding of how it all actually works."

      "answer": null,
      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "The only circumstances that are likely to change are that we will more rapidly descend into the next glacial stage, the 29th in the past\n 2.5 million years on a fairly cyclical timeframe, and that plants used for food will grow far slower than at present, causing a food\n\n shortage. If people are still around at that stage, they could possibly review the Bill if they choose."

      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "First, we need to look at why this is actually necessary. Every question in this questionnaire is framed in such a way that it is assumed\n\nthat firstly this Bill is necessary and secondly, that it is in the best interests of NZ and thirdly that it is a fait accompli and any sort of\ninput which does not agree with this will undoubtedly be disregarded. It is the death knell for democracy!!!!!!"

      "answer_index": 5,

      "answer_index": 5,
      "notes": "I've made a few as I went through. The most important one is that before this Bill is even discussed, there should be a very thorough\n\nexamination of unbiased research to see if, in fact, climate change is being driven by human activities. Two questions must be asked\nand answered: 1. If the climate changes rapidly in the other direction, i.e. it begins cooling as it has over the past few years, what will\nbe the response of the government? Maybe to burn oil to produce more CO2? 2. If climate keeps on changing, will that mean that we\n\nwill require a less than zero carbon Bill? What will be the government's response when they find, as they will, that regardless of what\nthey do, the climate continues to do its own thing? No, you won't have thought of these and certainly won't want to think of them in\n\nyour idealised, we're in control of everything world. Anyway, I'm just an elderly earth scientist - what would I know? It's my kids and\ngrandkids I feel sorry for with governments taking the attitude that the present one is with this Bill."
