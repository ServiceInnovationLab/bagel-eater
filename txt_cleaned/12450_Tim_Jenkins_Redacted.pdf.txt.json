      "notes": "I worry that not including short-lived gases in the reduction targets will slow down much needed innovation or changes in primary\n\n industry practice."

      "question": "3. How should New Zealand meet its targets?",
      "question_index": 2,
      "answer": "Domestic emissions reductions (including from new forest planting) and using some emissions reductions from overseas (international carbon units) that have strong environmental safeguards",
      "answer_index": 2,
      "notes": "I'm not entirely convinced about international carbon units as a way forward. But, in the short term they will allow for reductions while\n the country makes changes. However, it should be legislated that it is only a short-term approach so that industry and the population\n\n can't hide behind it and avoid making changes."

      "answer": "Yes",
      "answer_index": 3,
      "notes": "There must be strong requirement on governments to follow the Commission's guidance, much more so than with the way previous\n\ngovernment's have discounted the advice of the PCE. Getting the balance right between the Commission giving advice and\ngovernments discounting it for political reasons will be difficult but is essential to the success of the legislation. Without following the\n\nbest advice available governments will struggle."

      "notes": "Definitely. This is extremely important. Adaptation work is far too piecemeal and is influenced too much by political interference and\n\nNIMBYism. (For example, recent problems on Kapiti coast, I think, about setting coastal flood risk zones.)"
