NZ already uses mostly\nrenewable energy, has perhaps the worlds most efficient farming practices and an emissions output so low as to be negligible in\n\nimpact on the atmosphere. (and don't quote per-capita emissions output - those figures are a fiction- only total emissions count IF\nyou are serious about solving this over hyped issue - working on a per-captia basis suggests the issue is not at all pressing)\n\nFortunately, the modeled impacts of \"Climate Change\" are vastly over-hyped - and we do have far more pressing issues to deal with in\nNZ right now. The Government should instead commit the billions that will be wasted in Climate Mitigation & Zero Carbon Target\n\nadministration to NZ' s Children's health, safety and education. All we have to do to combat Climate Change is take off the jersey and\nwalk inland slowly.\nYou have elected to withhold your personal details from publication."
