      "answer_index": 0,
      "notes": "Having a set and immovable target is fundamental to the efficacy of this piece of legislation. Without a set target there are too many\n moving pieces and too much wiggle room between the Commission's recommendations and the governments actions. The point of\n the Act is to hold the government to account throughout a period of time, if the time period is movable so too is the accountability.\n\n The target should be zero net carbon, because it is ambitious but achievable."
