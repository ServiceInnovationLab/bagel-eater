      "notes": "NZ interest in biochar bloomed early in 2009 when the government funded ‘NZ Biochar Research Centre’ at Massey University began\n its work. Worldwide interest in biochar has grown almost exponentially over the last 15 years, as reflected in the growth in published\n\n literature on the subject and reports on international industry growth. NZ interest and activity associated with biochar has not kept\n pace with this international action. We now see a strong NZ resurgence in community interest and business activity in biochar. This\n interest and activity is currently localised, informal, poorly coordinated and unfunded. Biochar offers opportunities for multiple and\n\n cascading environmental benefits... all leading to carbon sequestration. Many biomass sources are available (wilding pine, coppice\n crops, forest/crop residues) along with co-product opportunities (heat, pyroligneous acids, etc) for small industry. Positive impacts on\n\n agriculture practices, water quality and nutrient management will also flow from biochar production and applications. The NZ\n government appears to be poorly informed on the interest and opportunities related to the resurgence of biochar activity.\n\n\n\n\n  You have elected to withhold your personal details from publication."
