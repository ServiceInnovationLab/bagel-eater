The sun is the primary driver of earth's climate, with modifications by cosmic rays, which modify both\n\nsolar activity and volcanic activity. The current warming from the last glacial period has come to an end, and from here on in it is going\nto get colder. To destroy our economy and energy wealth to attempt to take control of something by limiting a vital trace gas is\ncriminal.\n\n\n\n\n You have elected to withhold your personal details from publication."
