      "notes": "Ruminants are not to blame for global warming, humans are. Ruminants have a huge role to play in sequestering carbon in soils,\n particularly degraded farmland and grazing lands which have been badly mismanaged. However, growth of ruminant numbers should\n\n not be encouraged as extra meat would be exported and each country should be able to feed itself, or almost. Exported food does\n not feed many of the poor, but mainly the rich."
