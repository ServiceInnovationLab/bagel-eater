      "notes": "I'd like to make a submission on agricultural emissions, particularly the methane & CO2 emissions from bovines. 1. Grass & other\n\nanimal feed is created from atmospheric CO2, H2O & soil minerals. 2. Grazing animals are created wholly from grass or other feed\ncrops, H2O & O2 3. Humans & other omnivores are created from a mixture of points 1 & 2 above 4. Methane created by animals\n\nbreaks down into CO2 after 9-12 years 5. This is all part of the Carbon Cycle 6. When viewed over a 12 year timeframe, agricultural\nemissions must be Carbon neutral; aside from any fossil fuels consumed in transport & production. 7. While we should be reducing\n\nour consumption of fossil fuels, it is a mistake to punish agriculture for supposed emissions. 8. The greatest contributors to\nanthropogenic climate change are the release of trapped Carbon via fossil fuel use & deforestation of areas which would otherwise\nabsorb it. 9. Concentrating efforts on improving point 8 above is our best chance of making a difference."
