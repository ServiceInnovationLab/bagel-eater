      "notes": "Can someone please explain why pastoral farming is implicated as a contributor to net emissions when in fact it is a carbon neutral\n\n and natural part of the carbon cycle? All forage consumed by grazing herbivores fixes CO2 from the atmosphere and part of this\n captured carbon is returned to the atmosphere as a result of the digestive process in the form of methane, a short lived gas as\n compared to CO2. Part of the consumed forage carbon is retained by the soil as pasture litter breaks down and part is retained by the\n animal as it grows bone and muscle tissue, wool or dairy product. It could therefore be argued that pastoral farming is better than\n\n carbon neutral and should be lauded as a carbon credit industry rather than a net polluter. If the argument is pursued that pastoral\n farming is a carbon emitter then consideration needs to given to \"where did that carbon come from?\""
