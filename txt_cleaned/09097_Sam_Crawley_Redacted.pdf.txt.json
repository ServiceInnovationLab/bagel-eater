      "notes": "As a developed nation, NZ is in a good position to demonstrate that a net zero emissions economy and society is not only possible,\n but can be prosperous. Relying on international carbon units is not consistent with that approach. In fact, NZ should seek to become\n an exporter of emissions reductions units. Poorer countries, many of which have low levels of industrialisation, may need to emit\n\n longer in order to achieve development to levels equivalent to NZ. By purchasing international carbon units, we are depriving poorer\n countries of the finite (and quickly diminishing) resource of allowable GHG emissions."

      "notes": "I have not seen information on how the appointment process will operate. Given that there are likely to be some highly charged\npolitical issues around the commission, it may make sense to set out this process in more detail than usual. For instance, it may\nmake sense to set term limits for commissioners. This could limit the ability of future governments to make political appointments to\n\nthe commission, which bias its recommendations towards short-term political goals. This kind of \"stacking\" of an organisation is\ntypically harder for voters to hold to account, as it is less visible than the usual things voters consider when casting a vote."

      "notes": "Although a net zero target by 2050 is ambitious, it is likely to be insufficient to avoid even 2 degrees warming (even assuming all the\nworld's major emitters do the same). Recent research has shown that global emissions must peak by no later than 2030 to have a\n\nreasonable chance of staying below 2 degrees (https://eciu.net/assets/peak-emissions/), and even this assumes negative\nemissions will occur on a large scale later this century. Given this reality of the situation, it is worth considering an even more\n\nambitious target: net zero by 2040."
