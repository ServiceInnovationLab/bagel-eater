      "notes": "This submission is to note my total opposition to the Zero Carbon Bill and the concepts it contains. I submit that: 1. The Zero Carbon\n\nBill is a total nonsense driven by a radical uninformed agenda that has the potential to bring our Nation to its’ knees. 2. Economic\nforecasts point out that the economy will be radically worse off and up to a quarter smaller. 3. The forecasts show that the burden will\n\nfall disproportionately on lower income households which is not tenable. 4. Modelling shows that NZ’s major earning sectors such as\nsheep, beef, and dairy farming economic output could be halved. This makes no sense. 5. The Zero Carbon Bill fails dismally by not\n\nrecognising the true impact of moving to ‘green technologies such as wind and solar power. Once a 'Whole of Life Cycle Analysis' is\ncarried out the impact of manufacturing these items demonstrates a gross negative cost in terms of cost and emissions. The use of\n\nsteel and other resources makes a nonsense of the ‘green technology claim.sss 6. The facts do not support the concept of taxing\nMethane. It is known that Methane is short-lived in the atmosphere. Without methane, New Zealand would have one of the smallest\ngreenhouse gas emissions profiles in the developed world. It hangs around for about 10 years before it is converted to CO2. 7.\n\nLivestock are carbon neutral and thus methane from agriculture should not be included in emissions targets. For every unit of carbon\nthe animal emits as CH4 it must ingest the same amount of carbon from its plant-based feed source, which, comes initially from the\n\nCO2 in the atmosphere. The animal is both the source of the carbon in methane and it is also the sink for the equivalent amount of\ncarbon in CO2. In this sense the carbon-methane cycle - methane-to-CO2-to-forage-plants-to-animals-to-methane - is a closed cycle.\n\nThe animal is CH4-carbon neutral. 8. The Bill makes no mention of the increased Methane emissions from the massive Government\nTree Planting Policy. Trees emit Methane thus if methane is included the Government Policy and the Bill are in direct contradiction. In\nsummary in my opinion the Zero Carbon Bill as proposed is a huge hoax, and will only drive the economy into a downward spiral.\n\n\n\n\n You have elected to withhold your personal details from publication."
